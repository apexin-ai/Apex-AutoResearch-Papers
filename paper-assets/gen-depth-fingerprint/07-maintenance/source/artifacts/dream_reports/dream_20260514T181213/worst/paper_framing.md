## Core Insight
Non-paraphrastic LLM generation chains (continuation, elaboration) operate in an unbounded semantic state space — unlike paraphrasing chains that converge to attractor cycles (ACL 2025). This means distributional drift accumulates monotonically with generation depth, leaving detectable "fingerprints" in token-level statistics under a reference model. These fingerprints enable ordinal depth estimation, unlocking risk-stratified data curation beyond binary real/synthetic filtering.

## Core Claims (3 条，均可证伪)

**Claim 1 — Depth Discriminability**: Distributional features computed under a held-out reference model can classify text generation depth (gen-0 / gen-1 / gen-2+) with macro-F1 significantly above chance, generalizing across unseen generators (leave-one-generator-out evaluation).

**Claim 2 — Distributional Fingerprint Independence**: Reference-model-derived features (entropy statistics, tail-distribution decay) carry independent depth signal beyond surface vocabulary statistics (TTR, hapax ratio). Ablation: reference-only features achieve significantly higher F1 than surface-only features, or at minimum provide significant complementary signal.

**Claim 3 — Downstream Utility**: Predicted generation depth correlates with fine-tuning quality degradation (Spearman ρ), and depth-aware filtering outperforms binary detection baselines (FastDetectGPT, LD-Score threshold) for preserving downstream model quality.

## Story Spine

**Problem**: Web-scraped training data increasingly contains LLM-generated text of unknown provenance depth. Current detection methods offer only binary real-vs-synthetic classification, forcing all-or-nothing filtering: discard everything flagged as synthetic (losing useful gen-1 content) or keep everything (admitting high-risk deep-generation text with compounding distributional drift).

**Existing approaches & gaps**: Binary detectors (FastDetectGPT, SynthID-Text, LD-Score) cannot distinguish gen-1 from gen-2+. Attractor cycle theory (ACL 2025) proves paraphrasing chains converge to 2-period cycles, bounding depth signal to ~3 classes — but this result depends on the semantic-preservation constraint of paraphrasing. No existing work attempts generation depth estimation.

**Our framing**: We characterize distributional drift in recursive non-paraphrastic LLM generation as an empirical phenomenon with practical implications for data governance. We formalize two competing hypotheses — H₁ (convergence: recursive generation tends toward a distributional fixed point even for non-paraphrastic chains) vs H₂ (divergence: non-paraphrastic chains accumulate monotonic drift) — and test them via depth-dependent distributional features under a reference model. Regardless of which hypothesis prevails, the characterization itself provides actionable insight: if H₂, depth estimation enables risk-stratified curation; if H₁, we establish the theoretical ceiling for depth-based approaches.

**Headline result template**: "On multi-generator continuation chains across 4 domains, our distributional fingerprint features achieve macro-F1 of X for 3-class depth estimation (gen-0/gen-1/gen-2+), with leave-one-generator-out generalization at Y. Depth-aware filtering preserves Z% more downstream task performance compared to binary filtering baselines."

## Anticipated Reviewer Concerns

**RC1 — "Is this just vocabulary impoverishment?"**: If surface features (TTR, hapax) alone match full-feature performance, the "distributional fingerprint" framing is overclaimed. → Ablation experiment (Claim 2) directly addresses this.

**RC2 — "Does this generalize beyond Pythia?"**: MVP used same-family models (Pythia-2.8B generator + Pythia-410M reference). → Cross-family experiments: Qwen/OLMo generators + non-Pythia reference models (RQ1 cross-generator evaluation).

**RC3 — "Is 3-class sufficient? Why not finer-grained?"**: Attractor theory bounds paraphrasing to ~3 classes. → Secondary analysis: finer-grained ordinal classification (gen-0 through gen-4) on non-paraphrastic chains to test if more depth signal exists.

**RC4 — "How realistic are single-model chains?"**: Real web contamination involves diverse generators. → Cross-model chains (different generator per depth step) as primary evaluation setting (RQ3).

**RC5 — "What about human editing / post-processing?"**: Real-world synthetic text is often edited. → Robustness test with simulated human edits (random word replacement as lower-bound + LLM-simulated editing).

**RC6 — "Ecological validity — continuation vs real web content"**: Lab-constructed chains may not match wild distribution. → Multi-domain seeds (news, Wikipedia, scientific, creative) + multiple prompt types (continuation, elaboration, inspired rewriting).

## Venue Fit
- AAAI 2027: Strong fit — data governance + ML methodology. The H₁/H₂ hypothesis-testing framing positions it as empirical science, not just a classifier paper.
- EMNLP 2026: Excellent fit — directly addresses special theme "New Missions for NLP Research" (data contamination, synthetic data feedback loops, data governance). NLP-native venue for text-focused work.
