## Core Insight
Non-paraphrastic LLM generation chains exhibit **differential depth response** (DDR): **central-tendency/diversity features** (entropy_mean, TTR, hapax ratio) drift monotonically with depth, while **shape features** (entropy_max, tail_decay) remain near-stationary. This is consistent with recursive generation inducing a **location shift** in the NLL distribution while approximately preserving distributional shape. The contribution is: (a) the **task formulation** (generation depth classification beyond binary detection), (b) **empirical validation** across 8 generators / 5 model families (Pythia, OLMo, Qwen, Llama, Mistral; 0.6B–8B) showing DDR is robust, (c) a lightweight 7-feature ensemble achieving leak-free binary F1 = 0.694 under 8-gen LOGO. Depth signal degrades substantially under instruction tuning, restricting current scope to base models.

## Core Claims (3 条，均可证伪)

**Claim 1 — Depth Discriminability**: A 7-feature distributional ensemble can classify generation depth (gen-0 / gen-1 / gen-2+) with leak-free binary F1 = 0.694 (95% CI [0.688, 0.700]) under 8-generator LOGO evaluation, generalizing across unseen generators and model families (LOFO binary F1 = 0.686). Cross-model chains yield binary F1 = 0.830 under generator-level LOGO (5-gen subset). Primary metric is leak-free binary F1 (gen-1 vs gen-2+), excluding gen-0 to avoid seed-sharing leakage.

**Claim 2 — Differential Depth Response & Feature Complementarity**: Features exhibit DDR: drifting features show |ρ| > 0.60 (hapax −0.63, TTR −0.61, entropy_mean −0.60), while shape features show |ρ| < 0.10 (tail_decay 0.04). KS statistics confirm: drifting 0.516–0.537 vs shape 0.043–0.052 (~10× gap). Full 7-feature set (10-fold CV F1 = 0.773) outperforms surface-only (0.688) and reference-only (0.713; McNemar p ≈ 0). Reference-only yields higher binary F1 (0.833 vs 0.695) but surface features are essential for 3-class gen-0 discrimination.

**Claim 3 — Downstream Utility (Negative Finding)**: Depth-aware data curation does NOT improve downstream CLM quality. At equal sample count (n=3,951): random subsampling (ppl=2.367) outperforms depth 0–1 (2.387) and binary-filtered (2.389). TOST confirms equivalence at ±2% margin (p = 1.1×10⁻⁴). Full dataset (n=12,299, ppl=2.335) vs depth-filtered requires ±3% margin for equivalence. Depth fingerprinting is a **diagnostic** tool for provenance characterization, not a **curative** tool for data selection.

## Scope & Limitations (必须在论文中突出)

1. **Base models only**: Instruct-tuned models show substantially degraded signal (OLMo-Instruct LOGO F1 = 0.338 vs 0.763 base). Alignment-imposed length regulation and format constraints compress the distributional variation DDR exploits. This is the **primary scope limitation**.
2. **Temperature sensitivity**: Reliable within t ∈ [0.5, 0.9] (≤1 pp degradation from default t=0.7). At t = 1.0: −6 pp degradation; entropy_mean ρ drops from −0.60 to −0.002. Cross-temperature transfer degrades severely (t=0.7 → t=1.0: Qwen3-1.7B F1 drops 0.789 → 0.418).
3. **7-feature ensemble is not optimal**: Multi-detector ensembles (4-det + surface) achieve 3-class 0.795 vs 0.774 (+2.1 pp) and binary 0.708 vs 0.705 (+0.3 pp), but at 2.4× inference cost and 3.2× GPU memory. 7-feature positioned on **efficiency advantage**, not absolute performance.
4. **3-class resolution ceiling**: 5-class F1 drops to ~0.50; ordinal methods (CORAL, Frank-Hall) yield no improvement over standard XGBoost. Gen-1/gen-2+ boundary is the bottleneck (concentrates 86% of binary errors as FNs).
5. **Scale effect**: Larger generators show moderate degradation (Mistral-7B: 0.633, Qwen3-8B: 0.692 vs average 0.694). Higher-capacity models compress feature margins.
6. **Prompt-type dependence**: Continuation chains show stronger drift (F1 = 0.781) than elaboration (0.730).

## Story Spine

**Problem**: Web-scraped training data increasingly contains LLM-generated text of unknown provenance depth (7–17% of recent scientific papers). Current detection methods offer only binary real-vs-synthetic classification, conflating qualitatively different material: gen-1 retains much of the source distribution's lexical properties, while deeper text exhibits measurably reduced vocabulary diversity and compressed perplexity.

**Existing approaches & gaps**: Binary detectors (FastDetectGPT, Binoculars, LD-Score) cannot distinguish gen-1 from gen-2+. Attractor cycle theory (ACL 2025) bounds paraphrasing chains to ~3 classes but depends on semantic-preservation constraints. No existing method addresses generation depth estimation in non-paraphrastic continuation chains. When repurposed as ordinal depth predictors, single detector scores show moderate signal but high cross-generator variance.

**Our framing**: We formulate generation depth classification (gen-0/gen-1/gen-2+) and characterize DDR across 8 base-model generators from 5 families (0.6B–8B). Central-tendency features drift monotonically while shape features remain near-stationary, consistent with recursive generation inducing a location shift in the NLL distribution. A 7-feature ensemble achieves leak-free binary F1 = 0.694 under 8-gen LOGO with a single 410M reference model. Multi-detector ensembles achieve marginally higher F1 at 2.4× cost. The signal degrades under instruction tuning and high temperature, restricting current scope to base models at moderate temperatures.

**Headline result template**: "On 8 base-model generators from 5 families (0.6B–8B), our 7-feature ensemble achieves leak-free binary F1 = 0.694 under LOGO evaluation and 0.830 on cross-model chains, using a single 410M reference model. Depth-aware curation is statistically equivalent to random subsampling for downstream CLM quality (TOST p = 1.1×10⁻⁴ at ±2% margin), establishing depth fingerprinting as a diagnostic tool for provenance characterization."

## Anticipated Reviewer Concerns

**RC1 — "Is this just vocabulary impoverishment?"**: Surface features alone achieve 0.688, but full features achieve 0.773 (McNemar p ≈ 0). Reference features capture different, complementary signal. Reference-only yields higher binary F1 (0.833) but misses gen-0 discrimination. The complementarity itself is a finding.

**RC2 — "Does this generalize beyond Pythia?"**: 8 generators from 5 families (Pythia, OLMo, Qwen, Llama, Mistral). LOFO binary F1 = 0.686 confirms cross-family transfer. Cross-model chains (heterogeneous generators per depth step) yield binary F1 = 0.764.

**RC3 — "Is 3-class sufficient?"**: 5-class F1 drops to ~0.50. Ordinal methods (CORAL, Frank-Hall) yield no improvement. Gen-1/gen-2+ boundary is the resolution bottleneck. 3 classes represent practical ceiling.

**RC4 — "How realistic are single-model chains?"**: Cross-model chains (different generator per step) are evaluated and yield higher F1 (0.764 binary), suggesting generator heterogeneity amplifies distributional shifts.

**RC5 — "What about human editing?"**: Robustness test with simulated human edits (random word replacement + LLM-simulated editing). Reported in appendix.

**RC6 — "Ecological validity?"**: Multi-domain seeds (news, Wikipedia, scientific, creative) + multiple prompt types (continuation, elaboration, rewriting). Prompt-type dependence reported transparently (continuation 0.781 vs elaboration 0.730).

**RC8 — "Aren't these just OOD detection features?"**: Contribution is NOT the features but: (a) ordinal depth estimation formulation, (b) empirical DDR discovery (drifting vs stationary), (c) Findings-level empirical characterization. Paper explicitly connects to OOD/perplexity-based detection literature.

**RC9 — "Only base models — what about instruct?"**: Acknowledged as primary limitation. OLMo-Instruct LOGO F1 = 0.338 vs 0.763 base. Instruction tuning compresses the distributional variation DDR exploits. Reported transparently; defines scope boundary.

**RC10 — "Text length confound"**: Length-matched subsampling: binary F1 = 0.724 (vs 0.770 unmatched). Random-subsample control confirms drop reflects deconfounding, not sample-size reduction.

**RC11 — "Downstream — limited evidence"**: Three seeds, single perplexity metric. TOST equivalence confirmed at ±2% margin for equal-count comparison. Margin sensitivity analysis across ±1%–5% reported. Cohen's d inflated by low seed-level variance; TOST is the appropriate test.

## Contribution Positioning (Findings Level)
The contribution is **empirical and conceptual**, appropriate for Findings:
1. **Problem formulation**: Generation depth classification as a new task beyond binary detection (no prior work addresses this in non-paraphrastic chains)
2. **Empirical characterization**: DDR across 8 generators / 5 families (0.6B–8B), with cross-generator generalization (LOGO binary F1 = 0.694, LOFO 0.686, cross-model 0.764). Honest reporting of scope boundaries (instruct degradation, temperature sensitivity, scale effect).
3. **Negative finding**: Depth-aware curation ≡ random subsampling for downstream quality (TOST confirmed). Depth fingerprinting is diagnostic, not curative.

**Framing discipline:**
- Do NOT call the drift/stationarity split a "discovery" — it follows from location-shift properties of the NLL distribution. Acknowledge explicitly.
- Do NOT use H1/H2 terminology. Use "drifting" vs "stationary" or "differential response."
- Do NOT overclaim "dual dynamics." Use "differential depth response" (DDR).
- Report **realistic performance range** (binary F1 0.633–0.724 per-generator, 0.694 LOGO average) in abstract/conclusion, not best-case.
- Primary metric is leak-free binary F1 (not 3-class, which is inflated by gen-0 seed sharing).
- 7-feature ensemble is positioned on efficiency, not absolute superiority over multi-detector ensembles.

Related work must cover: perplexity-based detection (DetectGPT, GLTR, DNA-GPT, Binoculars), model collapse theory, OOD detection, data quality scoring, watermarking, vocabulary diversity, stylometry/authorship attribution, iterative generation (LLM as Broken Telephone ACL 2025), membership inference.

## Venue Fit
- EMNLP 2026 Findings: Excellent fit — directly addresses data contamination, synthetic data feedback loops, data governance. Empirical/conceptual contribution with honest scope boundaries. Findings-appropriate ambition level: novel task formulation + solid characterization, not a state-of-the-art methodology claim.
