## Core Insight
Non-paraphrastic LLM generation chains exhibit **dual depth dynamics** that cross-cuts the surface/reference distinction: **level/diversity features** (entropy_mean, TTR, hapax ratio) drift monotonically with depth (H₂), while **distributional shape features** (entropy_std, entropy_max, tail_decay) remain near-stationary (H₁). Notably, entropy_mean is a reference-model feature that drifts (ρ=-0.68), showing the H₁/H₂ split is about what the feature measures (central tendency vs shape), not where it comes from (surface vs reference). This dual pattern creates a complementary feature space: drifting features provide ordinal depth signal, while stable shape features provide noise-robust class boundaries. The combination significantly outperforms either alone (macro-F1 0.82 vs 0.76/0.72).

## Core Claims (3 条，均可证伪)

**Claim 1 — Depth Discriminability**: Distributional features computed under a held-out reference model can classify text generation depth (gen-0 / gen-1 / gen-2+) with macro-F1 significantly above chance, generalizing across unseen generators (leave-one-generator-out evaluation).

**Claim 2 — Dual Dynamics (Level vs Shape)**: Depth-dependent features split into two families by **what they measure**, not by their source (surface vs reference): (a) **level/diversity features** (entropy_mean, TTR, hapax_ratio) drift monotonically with depth (H₂ — vocabulary impoverishment + entropy compression); (b) **shape features** (entropy_std, entropy_max, tail_decay) remain near-stationary (H₁ — distributional shape is robust to recursive generation). This split cross-cuts the surface/reference boundary (entropy_mean is reference-derived but drifts). Full feature set (0.82) significantly outperforms surface-only (0.76) and reference-only (0.72) — the two dynamics are complementary for classification.

**Claim 3 — Downstream Utility**: Predicted generation depth correlates with fine-tuning quality degradation (Spearman ρ), and depth-aware filtering outperforms binary detection baselines (FastDetectGPT, LD-Score threshold) for preserving downstream model quality.

## Story Spine

**Problem**: Web-scraped training data increasingly contains LLM-generated text of unknown provenance depth. Current detection methods offer only binary real-vs-synthetic classification, forcing all-or-nothing filtering: discard everything flagged as synthetic (losing useful gen-1 content) or keep everything (admitting high-risk deep-generation text with compounding distributional drift).

**Existing approaches & gaps**: Binary detectors (FastDetectGPT, SynthID-Text, LD-Score) cannot distinguish gen-1 from gen-2+. Attractor cycle theory (ACL 2025) proves paraphrasing chains converge to 2-period cycles, bounding depth signal to ~3 classes — but this result depends on the semantic-preservation constraint of paraphrasing. No existing work attempts generation depth estimation.

**Our framing**: We characterize distributional drift in recursive non-paraphrastic LLM generation, revealing **dual dynamics**: level/diversity features (including reference-model entropy_mean) drift monotonically with depth (H₂), while distributional shape features (entropy variance, tail decay) remain near-stationary (H₁). This split is about **what the feature measures** (central tendency vs shape), not where it comes from — overturning the naive expectation that "reference-model features = robust, surface features = fragile." The dual pattern has practical value: drifting features provide ordinal depth signal, stable shape features provide noise-robust decision boundaries, and their combination yields the best depth estimation for risk-stratified data curation.

**Headline result template**: "On multi-generator continuation chains across 4 domains, our distributional fingerprint features achieve macro-F1 of X for 3-class depth estimation (gen-0/gen-1/gen-2+), with leave-one-generator-out generalization at Y. Depth-aware filtering preserves Z% more downstream task performance compared to binary filtering baselines."

## Anticipated Reviewer Concerns

**RC1 — "Is this just vocabulary impoverishment?"**: Surface features alone achieve 0.76 macro-F1, but full features achieve 0.82 (p<0.001). We don't claim reference features are "better" — we show they capture a **different, complementary** signal (stationary distributional shape vs drifting level/diversity). The dual dynamics finding is itself a scientific contribution. Note: "fingerprint" in the paper refers to the full feature vector's combination, not just reference-model features.

**RC7 — Pre-registered prediction (LD-Score)**: LD-Score (character-distribution signature) measures character-level distributional properties. We predict it is a **level feature** (sensitive to vocabulary/character frequency shifts) and should exhibit **H₂ drift** with depth. This prediction is registered before plan_011 execution as an out-of-sample test of the level/shape framework.

**RC2 — "Does this generalize beyond Pythia?"**: MVP used same-family models (Pythia-2.8B generator + Pythia-410M reference). → Cross-family experiments: Qwen/OLMo generators + non-Pythia reference models (RQ1 cross-generator evaluation).

**RC3 — "Is 3-class sufficient? Why not finer-grained?"**: Attractor theory bounds paraphrasing to ~3 classes. → Secondary analysis: finer-grained ordinal classification (gen-0 through gen-4) on non-paraphrastic chains to test if more depth signal exists.

**RC4 — "How realistic are single-model chains?"**: Real web contamination involves diverse generators. → Cross-model chains (different generator per depth step) as primary evaluation setting (RQ3).

**RC5 — "What about human editing / post-processing?"**: Real-world synthetic text is often edited. → Robustness test with simulated human edits (random word replacement as lower-bound + LLM-simulated editing).

**RC6 — "Ecological validity — continuation vs real web content"**: Lab-constructed chains may not match wild distribution. → Multi-domain seeds (news, Wikipedia, scientific, creative) + multiple prompt types (continuation, elaboration, inspired rewriting).

**RC8 — "Aren't these just OOD detection features?"**: Reference-model entropy statistics are functionally NLL-based OOD scores (same signal backbone as DetectGPT/GLTR/Binoculars). Our contribution is NOT the features themselves but: (a) the problem formulation (ordinal depth estimation, not binary detection), (b) the empirical discovery that these features exhibit dual dynamics (level drift vs shape stationarity) under recursive generation, and (c) the practical application to risk-stratified data curation. Paper must explicitly connect to OOD detection + perplexity-based detection literature and position the contribution as primarily empirical/conceptual rather than methodological.

**RC9 — "Only ≤2.8B generators — does this transfer to frontier scale?"**: All 5 current generators ≤2.8B. Frontier models (7B+) produce more fluent text that may compress depth signal. → Add at least one 7B+ generator (plan_014). If depth signal significantly weaker at scale → honest limitation with analysis of why; if comparable → strong generalization evidence.

**RC10 — "Text length confound"**: Hapax ratio and TTR are mechanically length-dependent. If generation chains produce texts of systematically different lengths, surface features may track length artifacts rather than distributional drift. → Length distribution analysis + length-normalized features + length-matched comparison (plan_013). Critical confound control.

**RC11 — "Downstream utility — single run, no CIs"**: Depth-aware filtering advantage must be validated with multiple seeds + bootstrap CIs + sample-count-matched comparison (to control for data size confound). Must use non-Pythia model for downstream fine-tuning (OLMo-1B) to avoid reference model circularity (Pythia-410M as both feature extractor and eval model).

## Contribution Positioning (Dream D006 insight)
The contribution is **primarily empirical and conceptual**, not methodological. The features (NLL summary statistics) and classifier (XGBoost) are standard — the novelty lies in:
1. **Problem formulation**: Ordinal depth estimation as a new task beyond binary detection
2. **Empirical discovery**: Dual dynamics (level/diversity drift vs shape stationarity) cross-cutting surface/reference boundary
3. **Practical application**: Risk-stratified data curation outperforming binary filtering

Do NOT overclaim "distributional fingerprinting" as a new method. Position the paper as empirical science with a novel task formulation and a surprising empirical finding. The H1/H2 framework is an empirical validation extending attractor cycle theory to non-paraphrastic chains, not a major theoretical contribution.

Related work must expand to 30+ references covering: perplexity-based detection (DetectGPT, GLTR, DNA-GPT, Binoculars), model collapse theory (Alemohammad et al., Dohmatob et al., Gerstgrasser et al., Guo et al.), OOD detection (Hendrycks & Gimpel), data quality scoring (DSIR, QuRating, CCNet), watermarking (Kirchenbauer et al.), vocabulary diversity (Guo et al. 2024, Padmakumar & He 2024, Holtzman et al. 2020).

## Venue Fit
- AAAI 2027: Fit as empirical + conceptual contribution — novel task formulation (depth estimation) + surprising empirical finding (dual dynamics) + practical application (data curation). Must position as empirical science, not methodology paper.
- EMNLP 2026: Excellent fit — directly addresses special theme "New Missions for NLP Research" (data contamination, synthetic data feedback loops, data governance). NLP-native venue for text-focused work. Empirical/conceptual contributions better received here than AAAI.
