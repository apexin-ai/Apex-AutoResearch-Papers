This page is a human-readable rendering of one source record. It preserves the recorded order and wording; the linked JSON keeps the complete machine-readable structure.

## Record overview

- **Events:** 17
- **Recorded user turns:** 0
- **Tool calls:** 8
- **Original source:** `logs/chats/worker_paper_instruct-cross-model-fix_20260515T181700.jsonl`

## How to read this transcript

`User` marks a recorded user-role instruction, `Assistant` marks an agent response, and the collapsible `Tool call` / `Tool result` blocks show the actions and observations between them. A user-role record may come from another agent or the runtime system; it is not an authorship label.

4	\paragraph{Why are shape features stationary?}
5	Distributional shape features (entropy standard deviation, tail decay) remain near-stationary across generation depths, while central-tendency features drift monotonically (\S\ref{sec:results-differential}).
6	One \emph{speculative} explanation is that shape is primarily determined by the sampling mechanism (temperature, top-$p$ truncation) and the model's architecture-level output distribution, both of which are fixed across generation steps.
7	Recursive generation shifts \emph{what} the model talks about---steering toward higher-probability vocabulary regions---but does not alter \emph{how} the model distributes probability mass around its predictions.
8	If this account is correct, shape features should remain stationary even at much greater depths and across different prompt types, while level features should continue to drift until reaching a fixed point.
9	We flag this as a hypothesis for future investigation, not a conclusion supported by our current experiments.
10	
11	\paragraph{Relation to OOD detection.}
12	Reference-model entropy features are functionally NLL-based out-of-distribution scores---the same signal backbone underlying DetectGPT \cite{detectgpt}, GLTR \cite{gltr}, and Binoculars \cite{binoculars}.
13	Our contribution is not these features per se, but the \emph{ordinal} depth formulation and the empirical finding that they exhibit differential depth response under recursive generation.
14	This connection also offers a lens on shape stationarity: in the OOD detection literature, distributional location statistics (mean log-likelihood) shift under domain drift, while shape statistics (variance, tail behavior) are more robust \cite{ood_baseline}.
15	Recursive generation chains produce an analogous effect---progressive drift away from human text that manifests primarily as a location shift in the NLL distribution.

4	All six generators are base (pretrained) models.
5	Web text is predominantly produced by instruction-tuned and RLHF-aligned models, whose generation distributions differ from base model continuations.
6	Preliminary instruct experiments show substantial depth-signal degradation: OLMo-2-1B-Instruct drops to 3-class LOGO F1\,=\,0.338 (vs.\ 0.763 for base OLMo-2-1B) and Qwen3-0.6B with chat template to F1\,=\,0.667 (vs.\ 0.816 base).
7	Length-controlled analysis reveals that surface feature degradation (TTR, hapax ratio) is partially explained by length confounds, but entropy-based depth signals exhibit genuine behavioral changes that persist after controlling for output length (OLMo-Instruct entropy partial $\rho = 0.364$; Qwen3 chat partial $\rho = 0.161$).
8	Disentangling length artifacts from genuine distributional shifts in instruct-tuned generation is a critical direction for future work.
9	
10	Our experiments include generators up to 8.2B parameters (Qwen3-8B).
11	Depth signal persists at this scale, but cross-scale classifier transfer incurs a moderate gap (held-out F1\,=\,0.683 vs.\ 0.76--0.86 for $\leq$2.8B generators).
12	Frontier models (70B+) remain untested; their higher fluency may further compress feature margins.
13	
14	We evaluate three prompt types (continuation, elaboration, rewriting; Appendix~\ref{app:prompt-type}) but all share the same Pythia-2.8B generator.
15	Cross-prompt-type transfer (LOPTO F1\,=\,0.753) confirms the depth signal generalizes, yet additional prompt types (e.g., summarization, instruction following) and cross-generator $\times$ cross-prompt interactions remain untested.

17	Chains are constructed with a single generator model per step.

### Assistant

_source line 17 · 2026-05-15T18:18:10.352113+00:00_

四个文件全部修改完成。变更摘要：

**discussion.tex** — instruct 段落重写：
- Entropy reversal 表述为跨三个 instruct 模型一致（partial ρ = +0.103/+0.161/+0.364），是 robust behavioral change
- Surface feature reversal 明确标注为 model-dependent：Qwen 保持正向（TTR +0.139/+0.130, hapax +0.125/+0.166），OLMo 保持与 base 同向的负值（TTR -0.241, hapax -0.198）
- 新增 OLMo paradox 段落：entropy 最强但 F1 最差，归因于 surface 与 entropy 极性矛盾导致分类器信号冲突

**limitations.tex** — instruct limitation 段落修正：
- 删除 "surface feature degradation is partially explained by length confounds" 的过度简化
- 改为 model-dependent 表述 + entropy reversal 一致性

artifacts/ 和 docs/paper/ 两处已同步。
