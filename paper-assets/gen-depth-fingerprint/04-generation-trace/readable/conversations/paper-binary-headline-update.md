1	\section{Introduction}
2	\label{sec:introduction}
3	
4	Web-crawled corpora are the dominant source of pretraining data for large language models (LLMs), yet an increasing fraction of this data is itself LLM-generated.
5	Estimates suggest that 7--17\% of recent scientific papers and peer reviews contain substantial LLM-modified content \cite{mapping_llm_science,monitoring_ai_review}, and this proportion continues to grow as generated text enters the web and becomes seed material for subsequent generation.
6	The result is recursive generation chains whose outputs progressively diverge from human-written text---a problem that current detection methods are ill-equipped to address.
7	
8	Existing detectors \cite{fast_detectgpt,binoculars,ld_score,detectgpt} provide binary real-vs-synthetic classification, forcing an all-or-nothing filtering decision: discard everything flagged as synthetic, losing potentially useful first-generation content, or retain everything, admitting text with compounding distributional drift.
9	This conflates qualitatively different material.
10	A first-generation continuation---an LLM expanding a human-written passage---retains much of the source distribution's lexical and structural properties.
11	A third- or fourth-generation text, conditioned recursively on prior LLM outputs, exhibits measurably reduced vocabulary diversity, compressed perplexity, and narrower token probability distributions.
12	Treating these as a single ``synthetic'' category discards provenance information that could inform risk-stratified curation decisions.
13	
14	We argue that a finer-grained characterization is needed: \emph{ordinal depth estimation}, the task of classifying text into generation depth classes (gen-0\,/\,gen-1\,/\,gen-2+) rather than producing a binary label.
15	We refer to the overall framework---features, classifier, and evaluation protocol---as \emph{depth fingerprinting}, distinguishing the method from the task it addresses.

1	\section{Results}
2	\label{sec:results}
3	
4	We evaluate depth fingerprinting along four axes: cross-generator classification (\S\ref{sec:results-classification}), differential depth response of individual features (\S\ref{sec:results-differential}), comparison with existing detection baselines (\S\ref{sec:results-baselines}), and downstream utility for data curation (\S\ref{sec:results-downstream}).
5	
6	\subsection{Depth Classification Performance}
7	\label{sec:results-classification}
8	
9	Table~\ref{tab:logo-results} reports leave-one-generator-out (LOGO) macro-F1 for 3-class depth estimation (gen-0\,/\,gen-1\,/\,gen-2+) across six generators spanning three model families and parameter counts from 0.6B to 8.2B.
10	
11	The 7-feature ensemble achieves 3-class LOGO F1\,=\,0.789 (Table~\ref{tab:logo-results}). Because gen-0 seed texts are shared across generators (\S\ref{sec:generation}), the gen-0 class F1 (0.94) may be inflated; we therefore report a leak-free binary evaluation (gen-1 vs.\ gen-2+, F1\,=\,0.723) as the primary metric in \S\ref{sec:results-baselines}.
12	Per-generator held-out F1 ranges from 0.683 (Qwen3-8B) to 0.856 (Pythia-1B).
13	Per-class F1 varies by depth: gen-0\,=\,0.94, gen-2+\,=\,0.80, gen-1\,=\,0.64; the primary difficulty lies in distinguishing gen-1 from gen-2+, where feature margins narrow.
14	
15	\paragraph{Cross-scale transfer.}
16	The six-generator evaluation includes Qwen3-8B (8.2B parameters), confirming that depth signal persists at scales beyond the $\leq$2.8B training generators.
17	However, cross-scale transfer incurs a moderate gap: Qwen3-8B held-out F1\,=\,0.683 (CI [0.668, 0.694]), compared to 0.76--0.86 for $\leq$2.8B generators.
18	Text generated by larger models is more fluent, compressing feature margins and making depth distinctions harder.
19	Notably, adding Qwen3-8B data \emph{improves} classification on the original five generators (+1.1\,pp to 0.811), indicating that cross-scale diversity benefits rather than dilut

3	
4	\subsection{AI-Generated Text Detection}
5	\label{sec:related-detection}
6	
7	Methods for distinguishing human-written from machine-generated text have evolved from statistical tests on token-level distributions \cite{gltr,grover,release_strategies} to zero-shot approaches exploiting reference-model likelihoods \cite{detectgpt,fast_detectgpt,binoculars,dna_gpt} and learned classifiers over linguistic features \cite{feat_aug_transformer,reliable_detection,ld_score}.
8	Recent work has pursued diverse detection signals: \citet{intrinsic_dimension} use intrinsic dimensionality estimates, \citet{diveye} propose surprisal diversity features directly comparable to our distributional features, and \citet{generator_barrier} characterize the distributional gap between human and model outputs.
9	\citet{wu_survey_2025} provide the most comprehensive recent survey; see also \citet{jawahar_survey} for an earlier overview.
10	A persistent limitation is that all these methods produce binary (real vs.\ synthetic) decisions.
11	Recent efforts extend detection to multi-class settings: \citet{beyond_binary} propose role recognition and involvement measurement to distinguish collaborative human-LLM generation scenarios, and the SemEval-2024 shared task \cite{semeval2024_task8} evaluates multi-generator attribution across domains and languages.
12	These approaches discriminate among different \emph{sources} (human vs.\ specific models) rather than recursive generation \emph{depth} within a single generator's chain.
13	Even when detection scores correlate with generation depth, they exhibit high cross-generator variance when repurposed as ordinal predictors (binary F1 from 0.52 to 0.71 across individual baselines; Table~\ref{tab:baselines}), because each score captures a single distributional property that generalizes inconsistently.

1	\section{Conclusion}
2	\label{sec:conclusion}
3	
4	We introduced ordinal generation depth estimation as a task beyond binary synthetic text detection, providing a framework for characterizing the provenance of web-crawled text at finer granularity.
5	Across six generators from three model families (0.6B--8.2B parameters), we documented differential depth response: central-tendency and diversity features drift monotonically with generation depth, while distributional shape features remain near-stationary.
6	A 7-feature ensemble combining both feature types achieves binary macro-F1 of 0.723 (95\% CI: [0.717, 0.729]) for leak-free depth discrimination across six base-model generators, with per-generator std of 0.051.
7	We also reported that depth-aware data curation does not improve downstream language model quality over random subsampling, establishing that, in our experimental setting, depth fingerprinting functions as a diagnostic tool for provenance characterization rather than a curative tool for data selection.
8	
9	Future work should extend evaluation to instruction-tuned and RLHF models, frontier-scale generators (70B+), mixed-generator chains that better approximate real-world contamination, and multilingual settings.
10	All code, data, and trained models will be released upon publication to facilitate reproducibility.

2	\label{sec:discussion}
3	
4	\paragraph{Why are shape features stationary?}
5	Distributional shape features (entropy standard deviation, tail decay) remain near-stationary across generation depths, while central-tendency features drift monotonically (\S\ref{sec:results-differential}).
6	One \emph{speculative} explanation is that shape is primarily determined by the sampling mechanism (temperature, top-$p$ truncation) and the model's architecture-level output distribution, both of which are fixed across generation steps.
7	Recursive generation shifts \emph{what} the model talks about---steering toward higher-probability vocabulary regions---but does not alter \emph{how} the model distributes probability mass around its predictions.
8	If this account is correct, shape features should remain stationary even at much greater depths and across different prompt types, while level features should continue to drift until reaching a fixed point.
9	We flag this as a hypothesis for future investigation, not a conclusion supported by our current experiments.
10	
11	\paragraph{Relation to OOD detection.}
12	Reference-model entropy features are functionally NLL-based out-of-distribution scores---the same signal backbone underlying DetectGPT \cite{detectgpt}, GLTR \cite{gltr}, and Binoculars \cite{binoculars}.
13	Our contribution is not these features per se, but the \emph{ordinal} depth formulation and the empirical finding that they exhibit differential depth response under recursive generation.
14	This connection also offers a lens on shape stationarity: in the OOD detection literature, distributional location statistics (mean log-likelihood) shift under domain drift, while shape statistics (variance, tail behavior) are more robust \cite{ood_baseline}.
15	Recursive generation chains produce an analogous effect---progressive drift away from human text that manifests primarily as a location shift in the NLL distribution.

12	Treating these as a single ``synthetic'' category discards provenance information that could inform risk-stratified curation decisions.

14	We argue that a finer-grained characterization is needed: \emph{ordinal depth estimation}, the task of classifying text into generation depth classes (gen-0\,/\,gen-1\,/\,gen-2+) rather than producing a binary label.

1	\section{Results}
2	\label{sec:results}
3	
4	We evaluate depth fingerprinting along four axes: cross-generator classification (\S\ref{sec:results-classification}), differential depth response of individual features (\S\ref{sec:results-differential}), comparison with existing detection baselines (\S\ref{sec:results-baselines}), and downstream utility for data curation (\S\ref{sec:results-downstream}).
5	
6	\subsection{Depth Classification Performance}
7	\label{sec:results-classification}
8	
9	Table~\ref{tab:logo-results} reports leave-one-generator-out (LOGO) macro-F1 for 3-class depth estimation (gen-0\,/\,gen-1\,/\,gen-2+) across six generators spanning three model families and parameter counts from 0.6B to 8.2B.
10	
11	The 7-feature ensemble achieves 3-class LOGO F1\,=\,0.789 (Table~\ref{tab:logo-results}). Because gen-0 seed texts are shared across generators (\S\ref{sec:generation}), the gen-0 class F1 (0.94) may be inflated; we therefore report a leak-free binary evaluation (gen-1 vs.\ gen-2+, F1\,=\,0.723) as the primary metric in \S\ref{sec:results-baselines}.
12	Per-generator held-out F1 ranges from 0.683 (Qwen3-8B) to 0.856 (Pythia-1B).
13	Per-class F1 varies by depth: gen-0\,=\,0.94, gen-2+\,=\,0.80, gen-1\,=\,0.64; the primary difficulty lies in distinguishing gen-1 from gen-2+, where feature margins narrow.
14	
15	\paragraph{Cross-scale transfer.}
16	The six-generator evaluation includes Qwen3-8B (8.2B parameters), confirming that depth signal persists at scales beyond the $\leq$2.8B training generators.
17	However, cross-scale transfer incurs a moderate gap: Qwen3-8B held-out F1\,=\,0.683 (CI [0.668, 0.694]), compared to 0.76--0.86 for $\leq$2.8B generators.
18	Text generated by larger models is more fluent, compressing feature margins and making depth distinctions harder.
19	Notably, adding Qwen3-8B data \emph{improves} classification on the original five generators (+1.1\,pp to 0.811), indicating that cross-scale diversity benefits rather than dilut

4	\subsection{AI-Generated Text Detection}
5	\label{sec:related-detection}
6	
7	Methods for distinguishing human-written from machine-generated text have evolved from statistical tests on token-level distributions \cite{gltr,grover,release_strategies} to zero-shot approaches exploiting reference-model likelihoods \cite{detectgpt,fast_detectgpt,binoculars,dna_gpt} and learned classifiers over linguistic features \cite{feat_aug_transformer,reliable_detection,ld_score}.
8	Recent work has pursued diverse detection signals: \citet{intrinsic_dimension} use intrinsic dimensionality estimates, \citet{diveye} propose surprisal diversity features directly comparable to our distributional features, and \citet{generator_barrier} characterize the distributional gap between human and model outputs.
9	\citet{wu_survey_2025} provide the most comprehensive recent survey; see also \citet{jawahar_survey} for an earlier overview.
10	A persistent limitation is that all these methods produce binary (real vs.\ synthetic) decisions.
11	Recent efforts extend detection to multi-class settings: \citet{beyond_binary} propose role recognition and involvement measurement to distinguish collaborative human-LLM generation scenarios, and the SemEval-2024 shared task \cite{semeval2024_task8} evaluates multi-generator attribution across domains and languages.
12	These approaches discriminate among different \emph{sources} (human vs.\ specific models) rather than recursive generation \emph{depth} within a single generator's chain.
13	Even when detection scores correlate with generation depth, they exhibit high cross-generator variance when repurposed as ordinal predictors (binary F1 from 0.52 to 0.71 across individual baselines; Table~\ref{tab:baselines}), because each score captures a single distributional property that generalizes inconsistently.
14	\citet{paraphrase_evades} and \citet{detection_possibilities} further demonstrate that detection robus

1	% Abstract — Depth Fingerprinting of Recursive LLM Generation Chains
2	\begin{abstract}
3	As LLM outputs accumulate on the web, training corpora increasingly contain recursively generated text of unknown provenance depth.
4	We formulate \emph{ordinal depth estimation}---classifying text as human-written (gen-0), first-generation synthetic (gen-1), or deeper (gen-2+)---beyond binary detection.
5	We characterize a \emph{differential depth response}: central-tendency and diversity features drift monotonically with generation depth, while distributional shape features remain near-stationary.
6	A 7-feature ensemble exploiting this complementarity achieves binary macro-F1 of 0.723 (95\% CI: [0.717, 0.729]) for gen-1 vs.\ gen-2+ depth discrimination---excluding gen-0 to avoid shared-seed overlap---($p < 0.001$ vs.\ all baselines) across 6 base-model generators from 3 model families (0.6B--8.2B parameters), with per-generator consistency (std\,=\,0.051).
7	In our setting, depth-aware data curation does not outperform random subsampling, positioning depth fingerprinting as a diagnostic tool for provenance characterization.

All checks pass. Here's the summary:

**Task 1 (abstract)**: Added gen-0 shared-seed exclusion caveat ("---excluding gen-0 to avoid shared-seed overlap---") to both `artifacts/_project/paper/abstract.tex` and `docs/paper/abstract.tex`. Binary F1=0.723 was already the headline.

**Task 2 (introduction)**: No changes needed — binary F1=0.723 was already the headline in both the main paragraph (line 25) and contribution list (line 34). No stale 0.789-as-headline usage found.

**Task 3 (results P1-E ordinal)**: Already written at `results.tex:53-58`. CORAL 0.771, Frank-Hall 0.793, XGBoost 0.789 (3-class); XGBoost 0.721, CORAL 0.728 (binary); concordance all CIs overlapping. Conclusion already states standard XGBoost suffices.

**Task 4 (related_work CI fix)**: No CI/confidence-interval mentions exist in `related_work.tex`. Non-issue.

**Task 5 (consistency check)**: 0.789 appears only in appropriate 3-class contexts (results tables, ablation, supplementary, discussion comparisons). 0.723 is the primary metric in abstract, intro, conclusion, discussion, and results baseline section. No stale headline usage.

**Task 6 (docs/paper sync)**: Abstract synced. Introduction and results were already identical across both locations.
