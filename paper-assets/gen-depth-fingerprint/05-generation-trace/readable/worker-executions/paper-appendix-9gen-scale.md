1	\section*{Limitations}
2	\label{sec:limitations}
3	
4	All eight generators are base (pretrained) models.
5	This is a deliberate design choice: base models isolate the generation mechanism from instruction-tuning effects, enabling controlled study of recursive distributional drift.
6	However, web text is predominantly produced by instruction-tuned and RLHF-aligned models.
7	Preliminary instruct experiments confirm that depth signal degrades substantially under instruction tuning: OLMo-2-1B-Instruct drops to LOGO F1\,=\,0.338 (vs.\ 0.763 base) and Qwen3-0.6B with chat template to 0.667 (vs.\ 0.816 under a 7-generator split).
8	Length-matched analysis yields near-zero correlations ($|\rho| < 0.02$) and binary classification near chance (F1\,$\approx$\,0.5) for Qwen models, leaving interpretation ambiguous.
9	Extending depth fingerprinting to instruct models requires addressing these confounds (length regulation, format constraints, safety-driven distribution shaping) that instruction tuning introduces.
10	
11	Our experiments include generators up to 8.2B parameters (Qwen3-8B).
12	Depth signal persists at this scale (Qwen3-8B 3-class F1\,=\,0.714), but cross-scale transfer incurs a moderate gap vs.\ $\leq$2.8B generators (F1\,=\,0.77--0.81).
13	Frontier models (70B+) remain untested; their higher fluency may further compress feature margins.
14	
15	Differential depth response strength is prompt-type dependent: within-type 3-class F1 ranges from 0.78 (continuation) to 0.73 (elaboration), with inspired rewriting intermediate at 0.74 (Appendix~\ref{app:prompt-type}).
16	DDR is most reliably detected in continuation-style generation; near-paraphrastic settings approach the method's detection floor.
17	Cross-prompt-type transfer (LOPTO F1\,=\,0.753) confirms shared signal, yet additional prompt types (e.g., summarization, instruction following) and cross-generator $\times$ cross-prompt interactions remain untested.
18	
19	Our primary evaluation uses single-generator chains; cross-model chains (\S\ref{sec:results-classification}) confirm depth signal under generator heterogeneity (3-class F1\,=\,0.789, binary F1\,=\,0.830; evaluated on the 5-generator subset for which cross-model chains were available), though these generators represent a controlled laboratory setting rather than the full diversity of real-world contamination.
20	Simulated human editing (\S\ref{sec:discussion}) suggests graceful degradation, but the gap between simulated token replacement and real-world post-processing remains untested.
21	Independent gen-0 seed sets per generator would eliminate potential memorization effects in 3-class LOGO evaluation; we report leak-free binary F1 as the primary metric to mitigate this limitation.
22	
23	The reference model is fixed to Pythia-410M throughout, although cross-family reference experiments (\S\ref{sec:results-differential}) confirm the phenomenon is not reference-specific (spread 0.013 across three references).
24	All seed texts in the main evaluation are English Wikipedia excerpts.
25	Cross-domain evaluation (Appendix~\ref{app:domain}) shows that depth signal persists across News, Academic, and Code domains (binary F1 $>$ 0.73 under LOGO at $t{=}1.0$), though a domain $\times$ temperature interaction exists: certain domain/generator combinations at lower temperature approach chance level (e.g., Academic domain binary F1\,=\,0.628 at $t{=}0.7$), suggesting that reference model calibration is critical for cross-domain deployment.
26	The reference model dependency (Pythia-410M, English-centric pretraining) limits non-English applicability and adds inference overhead relative to surface-feature-only approaches.
27	Generalization to other languages remains untested.
28	
29	Our default analysis uses fixed decoding parameters (temperature 0.7, nucleus $p{=}0.9$). A sampling ablation (Appendix~\ref{app:sampling-sensitivity}) shows robustness to moderate variation ($t \in [0.5, 0.7]$, ${\leq}0.3$\,pp) but substantial degradation at $t{=}1.0$ ($-6$\,pp), indicating that depth fingerprinting assumes standard decoding regimes.
30	Cross-temperature transfer shows substantial degradation when test-time temperature exceeds training-time settings, limiting deployment to scenarios where the generation temperature is approximately known.
31	
32	We use 3-class granularity (gen-0\,/\,gen-1\,/\,gen-2+). A 5-class evaluation (Appendix~\ref{app:finer-depth}) yields LOGO F1\,$\approx$\,0.50, with depths 2--4 mutually indistinguishable, validating the 3-class design as the practical resolution limit.

3	in place of XGBoost (Table~\ref{tab:alt-classifier}).

24	Both tree-based classifiers achieve LOGO F1 $\approx 0.79$,
25	and even a linear model reaches $0.725$, well above the $0.33$ chance baseline for
26	three classes.
27	The per-generator ranking is also consistent across classifiers
28	(Pythia-1B easiest, Qwen3-8B hardest),
29	confirming that discriminative power originates in the entropy and lexical features,
30	not in classifier capacity.
31	Ordinal-specific methods (CORAL \cite{coral_ordinal}, Frank-Hall \cite{frank_hall_ordinal}) achieve comparable F1 with overlapping CIs, which confirms that 3-class granularity provides insufficient resolution for ranking-aware losses to improve over standard multiclass classification.

A sampling ablation (Appendix~\\ref{app:sampling-sensitivity}) shows robustness to moderate variation ($t \\in [0.5, 0.7]$, ${\\leq}0.3$\\,pp) but substantial degradation at $t{=}1.0$ ($-6$\\,pp), indicating that depth fingerprinting assumes standard decoding regimes.\nCross-temperature transfer shows substantial degradation when test-time temperature exceeds training-time settings, limiting deployment to scenarios where the generation temperature is approximately known.\n\nWe use 3-class granularity (gen-0\\,/\\,gen-1\\,/\\,gen-2+). A 5-class evaluation (Appendix~\\ref{app:finer-depth}) yields LOGO F1\\,$\\approx$\\,0.50, with depths 2--4 mutually indistinguishable, validating the 3-class design as the practical resolution limit.\n",

### Assistant

_source line 26_

Now I need to add the `\input` for the new appendix in main.tex. I'll add it after the last appendix (ddr_causality), before `\end{document}`. But per the task instructions, I should not modify main.tex. Let me re-read the constraint.

The instruction says "不要修改 main.tex". I'll skip that. The user will need to add the `\input` line themselves if they want it compiled.

Wait — the instruction says not to modify main.tex's **headline numbers** (8-gen LOGO F1=0.694 remains primary metric). But the appendix needs to be `\input`'d from somewhere. Let me re-read: "不要修改 main.tex" is explicit. I'll flag this to the user.

Two files updated:

1. **Created** `appendix_9gen_scale.tex` with the 9-generator LOGO table, overall comparison paragraph, Gemma-2-2B anomaly discussion, and scale effect analysis.

2. **Edited** `limitations.tex` line 12 — added the Gemma-2-2B sentence with cross-reference to `Appendix~\ref{app:9gen-scale}`.

**Note:** Per the constraint "不要修改 main.tex", I did not add `\input{appendix_9gen_scale}` to `main.tex`. You'll need to add it manually — suggested location is after line 182 (`\input{appendix_ddr_causality}`), e.g.:

```latex
\input{appendix_9gen_scale}
\FloatBarrier
