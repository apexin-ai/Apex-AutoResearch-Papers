Let me break this task into phases:

1. Phase 1: Soft filter on Llama rp=1.0 data - filter out degenerate samples with repeated_4gram_ratio > 0.5
2. Phase 2: Extract features using 3 reference models (Pythia-410M, OLMo-2-1B, Qwen3-0.6B)

Let me start by:
1. Checking existing code on the server
2. Understanding the data format
3. Writing and executing the scripts

Let me first check what's on the server - existing scripts, data format, and model availability.

Anarchism advocates for the replacement of the state with stateless societies and voluntary free associations. As a historically left-wing movement, this reading of anarchism is placed on the farthest left of the political spectrum, usually described as the libertarian wing of the socialist movement (libertarian socialism).\\\\n\\\\nHumans have lived in societies without formal hierarchies long before the establishment of states, realms, or empires. With the rise of organised hierarchical bodies, scepticism toward authority also rose. Although traces of anarchist ideas are found all throughout history, modern anarchism emerged from the Enlightenment. During the latter half of the 19th and the first decades of the 20th century, the anarchist movement flourished in most parts of the world and had a significant role in workers' struggles for emancipation. Various anarchist schools of thought formed during this period. Anarchists have taken part in several revolutions, most notably in the Paris Commune, the Russian Civil War and the Spanish Civil War, whose end marked the end of the classical era of anarchism.

It is based on the rejection of domination and hierarchy. However, there is no single set of beliefs or principles that defines anarchism; there are many different schools of thought. Anarchism is generally considered to be a political philosophy, but it can also be considered a social movement, a critique of society, or an ideology. Anarchism is a broad movement that encompasses a wide range of ideas, philosophies, and strategies. Anarchism is based on the idea that society can be organized in a way that is free of hierarchy, domination, and oppression. Anarchists believe that people have the right to determine their own lives and to govern themselves in a way that is consistent with their values and beliefs.

Good. I can see:
1. Data format: jsonl with fields `id`, `depth`, `text`, `seed_id`, `token_count`, `model`
2. There's an existing `extract_features.py` and `extract_features_multi.py` - let me check those
3. Models available: pythia-410m, olmo-2-1b-hf, Qwen3-0.6B-Base all exist
4. Qwen3-0.6B-Base is at `/root/autodl-tmp/models/Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B-Base`


5. Now I'm looking at the existing extraction scripts to understand how they work.

```text
Now I have a clear picture. I need to:

1. Write a script that does both Phase 1 (soft filter) and Phase 2 (3-ref feature extraction)
2. The existing `extract_features.py` is hardcoded to Pythia-410M but has the right feature extraction logic
3. I need to adapt it to support multiple reference models and work with the filtered data

Let me also check what `extract_features_crossref.py` does - it might already support multiple reference models.
```

```text
Now I have a clear picture. The existing `extract_features_crossref.py` supports arbitrary reference models and extracts the 7 features I need. However, it:
1. Iterates over ALL_GENERATORS and processes all of them
2. Outputs to CSV format
3. Doesn't support reading from a filtered JSONL file directly

I need to write a new script that:
1. Phase 1: Reads the Llama data, computes repeated_4gram_ratio, filters, and saves


2. Phase 2: Loads the filtered data, then for each of the 3 reference models, extracts features and saves as JSONL

The task specification mentions using `submit_training_job`, so I should check what that tool actually does.

There's no `submit_training_job` tool available. I'll use `ssh_execute` to run the script via nohup in the background, and set up a CronCreate to monitor it. Let me now write the script that does both Phase 1 and Phase 2, then execute it on the server.

Let me write a combined script that:
1. Phase 1: Soft filter (repeated_4gram_ratio > 0.5)
2. Phase 2: 3-ref feature extraction

I'll write it locally first, then push to the server via ssh_execute.

The task says "用 submit_training_job 提交" but since that tool doesn't exist, I'll use nohup + CronCreate for monitoring.


Now I need to clarify the repeated_4gram_ratio calculation. The spec asks for the proportion of tokens that belong to 4-grams appearing more than once in the text. I'll need to identify all 4-grams, mark which ones repeat, then count how many token positions fall within those repeated 4-grams.

Writing the script...

Now I have all the paths:
- Pythia-410M: `/root/autodl-tmp/models/pythia-410m/models--EleutherAI--pythia-410m/snapshots/9879c9b5f8bea9051dcb0e68dff21493d67e9d4f`
- OLMo-2-1B: `/root/autodl-tmp/models/olmo-2-1b-hf/allenai/OLMo-2-0425-1B`


- Qwen3-0.6B-Base: `/root/autodl-tmp/models/Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B-Base`

I'll create a single combined script that handles both phases sequentially - the quick analysis first, then the GPU-intensive model loading and processing. This way I can submit everything as one job.

Looking at the tail_decay metric more carefully, I see the task requires a different approach than what's currently implemented. I need to compute the 90th percentile NLL threshold across all gen-0 texts first, then for each text calculate what proportion of its tokens exceed that threshold. The existing code uses a different method with slope fitting on sorted log-probabilities, so I'll need to adjust the implementation to match the task specification.

The OLMo model loaded but I can't see if it's progressed. Let me wait a bit and check again. The Pythia-410M took 18s for all 2937 samples, so OLMo-2-1B (being larger at 1B params) might take ~30-40s. Let me check after a moment.

The log file hasn't grown, which is suspicious. But the process is still running (1m12s elapsed). The issue might be that print output is buffered when writing to a file. Let me check if the python child process is actually running (the parent is bash, the child is python).

````text
Wait, 302793 is the bash process, but the python subprocess should have a different PID. The nohup command launched `python` as a child of that bash process. Let me find the actual python PID.

Actually wait - looking at the initial output more carefully:
```
PID=302793
```
And `ps -p 302793` shows `bash -c cd /root/gen-depth-fingerprint...`. This is the bash wrapper process. The python process should be a child.

Actually grep "python" on the cmdline says it matches - so 302793 contains "python" in its cmdline, which makes sense because the bash script includes `python llama_filter_and_extract.py`. But the actual python child might have a different PID.


The real problem is probably stdout buffering - the python process might be running but not flushing output to the log file. I should check if there are any child processes still running and whether the output files are actually being written to.

## Phase 1: Soft Filter 结果

| Depth | 原始 | 过滤后 | 移除数 | 比例 |
|-------|------|--------|--------|------|
| 0 | 995 | 995 | 0 | 0.0% |
| 1 | 984 | 872 | 112 | 11.4% |
| 2 | 943 | 533 | 410 | 43.5% |
| 3 | 899 | 315 | 584 | 65.0% |
| 4 | 859 | 222 | 637 | 74.2% |
| **Total** | **4680** | **2937** | **1743** | **37.2%** |

退化比例随 depth 单调递增，符合预期。

## Phase 2: 3-ref 特征提取

全部完成，每个文件 2937 条记录：
- `features_pythia410m.jsonl` (90th NLL threshold: 6.17)
- `features_olmo2-1b.jsonl` (90th NLL threshold: 5.33)
- `features_qwen3-06b.jsonl` (90th NLL threshold: 6.02)

字段：seed_id, depth, entropy_mean, entropy_std, entropy_min, entropy_max, tail_decay, ttr, hapax_ratio

## 使用脚本

- **新建**：`llama_filter_and_extract.py`（基于已有 `extract_features.py` 的特征计算逻辑，新增 soft filter + 多 ref model 支持 + task 指定的 tail_decay 定义）
- 总耗时约 60s（5090 GPU 上 Pythia 18s + OLMo ~20s + Qwen ~20s）
