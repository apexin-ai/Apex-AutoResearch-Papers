## EC-HTE: Error-Corrected Heterogeneous Treatment Effect Estimation Under LLM Annotation Misclassification

## Problem and Motivation

When NLP researchers use LLM-generated annotations as effect modifiers in causal heterogeneous treatment effect (HTE) analysis, a previously unrecognized structural bias arises: LLM misclassification rates covary with the true conditional average treatment effect (CATE). Subgroups where LLMs err most in annotation (e.g., marginalized populations, linguistically complex cases) are often the same subgroups where treatment effects are largest. This creates a confounding between measurement error and causal heterogeneity that cannot be resolved by any global correction method—including arm-specific rectifiers (Mozer, arXiv:2603.19160), which address average treatment effect (ATE) bias but are algebraically incapable of correcting subgroup-level CATE distortions.

This problem is urgent. LLM-as-annotator has become the default pipeline for computational social science (Audinet de Pieuchon et al., EMNLP 2025, benchmarking DSL vs. PPI debiasing; StratPPI, Fisch et al., NeurIPS 2024, improving PPI via stratification), and researchers increasingly use LLM annotations not just for ATE estimation (where DSL and PPI provide corrections) but for subgroup analysis and effect modification—yet no correction method exists for this latter use case. Messing (arXiv:2604.11581) documents that hidden measurement error in LLM pipelines causes naive confidence intervals to under-cover by 40–60%, but this analysis remains at the aggregate level. Ashwin et al. (Sociological Methods & Research, 2025) provide direct empirical evidence that LLM coding errors in refugee interview transcripts correlate systematically with respondents' refugee status, gender, and education level—precisely the variables used as effect modifiers in downstream causal analysis. Any study using LLM-annotated text variables as moderators produces unreliable heterogeneity findings whenever annotation error rates differ across subgroups—and Ashwin et al. show this is the norm, not the exception.

**Key anti-intuitive finding: global correction can actively worsen CATE estimates.** Consider a two-subgroup example. Subgroup A has high misclassification (25%) and large CATE (0.5 SD); Subgroup B has low misclassification (5%) and small CATE (0.1 SD). A global correction uses a pooled confusion matrix (~15% error), which under-corrects Subgroup A and over-corrects Subgroup B. The net effect: globally-corrected CATE estimates can have *larger* bias than uncorrected estimates. This is not an edge case—it occurs whenever the misclassification pattern and CATE structure are positively correlated, which empirical evidence suggests is common in practice.

## Core Contributions

This paper makes four contributions:

1. **Problem identification and formalization.** We identify and formalize measurement-error-induced CATE distortion—a new class of bias arising when LLM annotation errors in effect modifiers are differential across subgroups and correlated with the true heterogeneity structure. We show this is structurally distinct from: ATE-level debiasing (Mozer, arXiv:2603.19160; Egami et al., NeurIPS 2023 DSL; Zrnic & Candès, ICML 2024), CATE-to-GATE aggregation bias (Persson et al., arXiv:2602.20383, where bias originates from aggregation, not measurement error), and conditional inference with outcome prediction noise (Sui et al., arXiv:2603.05575 PPCI, which assumes the conditioning variable is correct). We prove that global correction can *increase* CATE bias relative to uncorrected estimates when misclassification and CATE heterogeneity are positively correlated.

2. **Actionable diagnostic criterion (Bias Bound).** We derive a finite-sample bound: the bias of globally-corrected CATE estimates is proportional to the product of (a) misclassification heterogeneity across subgroups and (b) CATE heterogeneity across subgroups. This product yields a practical diagnostic: given pilot data, any researcher can compute this quantity *before* running full CATE analysis to determine whether global correction suffices or stratified correction is necessary. This diagnostic has standalone value independent of the EC-HTE framework—it applies to any CATE analysis using LLM-annotated effect modifiers. The bound implies that bias is worst when annotation is least accurate for subgroups where treatment effects are largest—empirically common (Ashwin et al., 2025).

3. **EC-HTE: A three-stage correction framework** providing subgroup-specific misclassification correction, valid confidence intervals, and optimal annotation allocation (detailed below).

4. **Empirical validation** via semi-synthetic benchmarks with controlled DGPs (including systematic variation of misclassification-CATE correlation direction) and a real-data misclassification pattern validation (Ashwin et al., 2025, Rohingya interview corpus).

## Why Not Just Use Expert Labels?

A natural objection: why not skip LLM annotation entirely and estimate CATEs using only expert-labeled data? The answer is a bias-variance tradeoff specific to CATE estimation. With a budget of ~2,000 expert labels distributed across k subgroups, each subgroup contains ~2,000/k observations. Honest causal forests (Wager & Athey, JASA 2018) split this further into estimation and splitting samples, leaving each cell with ~1,000/k observations—insufficient for detecting moderate heterogeneity when k ≥ 4.

EC-HTE resolves this by using the full unlabeled corpus (potentially hundreds of thousands of LLM-annotated observations) for low-variance CATE estimation, with expert labels only for calibrating subgroup-specific misclassification. This extends the PPI/DSL paradigm—combining noisy large-scale with clean small-scale data—from ATE to CATE, where data demands make the combination even more critical.

## Method: Three-Stage Framework

**Stage 1: Hierarchical Bayesian Subgroup-Specific Misclassification Estimation.** For each effect-modifier subgroup g ∈ {1, …, k}, we estimate a confusion matrix C_g between LLM annotation and expert gold standard using a hierarchical Bayesian model with partial pooling. The hierarchy allows low-sample subgroups to borrow strength from the global structure while permitting genuine cross-subgroup variation. This addresses a key tension: per-subgroup independent estimation (high variance when subgroup expert-label counts are small) vs. single global estimation (biased when misclassification rates genuinely differ). For computational scalability in large-scale simulation studies, we use variational inference (VI) as the primary fitting method, with MCMC validation on representative configurations in the appendix.

**Stage 2: Corrected CATE Estimation with Sandwich Variance Adjustment.** Corrected effect-modifier assignments are fed into an honest causal forest (Wager & Athey, JASA 2018). Because Stage 1 introduces nuisance parameter uncertainty, naive confidence intervals will under-cover. We derive a sandwich variance inflator propagating Stage 1 uncertainty into Stage 2 CIs, ensuring valid coverage. Bootstrap-based CIs serve as a robustness check.

**Stage 3: Adaptive Expert Annotation Allocation.** Given a fixed expert budget B, we optimize allocation across subgroups by jointly minimizing misclassification estimation uncertainty and CATE estimation variance. The allocation criterion targets subgroups where the product of misclassification uncertainty and CATE magnitude is largest—precisely where annotation errors cause the most CATE distortion (as predicted by the bias bound).

**Cold-start protocol.** Since Stage 3 requires initial estimates of both misclassification rates and CATE magnitudes, we employ a multi-batch protocol: (a) allocate 20–30% of B as a uniform pilot batch; (b) estimate initial confusion matrices and CATE values; (c) allocate remaining budget adaptively. We include pilot ratio sensitivity analysis (10%, 20%, 30%) in the experiments.

## Related Work and Differentiation

**Thread 1: LLM annotation debiasing (ATE-level).** DSL (Egami et al., NeurIPS 2023), PPI and its algebraic equivalence to survey-sampling difference estimators (Mozer, arXiv:2603.19160), active inference (Zrnic & Candès, ICML 2024), stratified PPI (StratPPI, Fisch et al., NeurIPS 2024), active multi-predictor PPI (AM-PPI, arXiv:2605.08429), and benchmarking thereof (Audinet de Pieuchon et al., EMNLP 2025). All locked to population-level estimands. Messing (arXiv:2604.11581) diagnoses hidden measurement error causing 40–60% CI under-coverage but does not extend to causal HTE correction.

**Thread 2: HTE/CATE estimation methods.** Honest causal forests (Wager & Athey, JASA 2018), DR-learner, CATE-to-GATE aggregation bias correction (Persson et al., arXiv:2602.20383, shrinkage for aggregation-induced bias assuming clean covariates), and assumption-lean HTE detection under mismeasured modifiers (Boileau et al., arXiv:2512.03254, hypothesis testing for whether heterogeneity exists, not CATE estimation—complementary to EC-HTE). CATE evaluation standards established in "Really Doing Great at Estimating CATE?" (NeurIPS D&B 2021).

**Thread 3: Conditional inference with ML predictions.** PPCI (Sui et al., arXiv:2603.05575) extends PPI to conditional functionals at fixed test points via kernel localization. Critical distinction: PPCI addresses outcome prediction noise at a correctly-specified conditioning point; EC-HTE addresses the situation where the conditioning variable (effect modifier) itself is misclassified. PPCI's localization anchors on correct covariate values—when the anchor itself is wrong (categorical misclassification), kernel localization cannot help.

**Thread 4: Measurement error correction for ML-generated variables.** ForestIV (Bu et al., INFORMS JDS 2023) uses random forest tree tuples as instrumental variables, but requires IV exclusion restrictions and is limited to regression settings, not CATE with categorical effect modifiers. Jerzak et al. (arXiv:2509.12416, SRI framework) provide valid inference under noisy annotation but do not address effect modifier misclassification's impact on HTE. SIMEX handles continuous measurement error models but does not directly apply to categorical misclassification.

**Thread 5: Causal inference with textual variables.** Feldman et al. (arXiv:2602.15730) address latent textual treatment estimation using SAE + residualization, assuming clean effect modifiers. Nwankwo et al. (arXiv:2502.10605, NeurIPS 2025 Workshop) optimize annotation allocation for doubly robust ATE with missing outcomes—different estimand (ATE vs. CATE), different error source (outcome missingness vs. effect modifier misclassification), different optimization landscape.

EC-HTE sits at the intersection of Threads 1–4: correcting LLM misclassification specifically in effect modifiers for valid CATE estimation.

## Validation Design

### Semi-Synthetic Experiments

**Corpus.** Political science text corpus with real-world linguistic variation (e.g., immigration framing data or partisan tweet datasets with known ideological annotations).

**DGP Matrix.** Core factors:
- Misclassification severity: high (25–30%) vs. low (5–10%)
- CATE heterogeneity magnitude: large (>0.3 SD) vs. small (<0.1 SD)
- Subgroup count: k=3 vs. k=6
- **Misclassification-CATE correlation direction**: positive (high-error subgroups have high CATE, worst-case) vs. negative (high-error subgroups have low CATE, best-case)

Selective design: 12–14 configurations covering all worst-case/best-case combinations for the key factors, rather than full 2⁴=16 factorial.

Treatment assignment T ~ Bernoulli(0.5); potential outcomes Y(1), Y(0) generated with known ground-truth CATE τ(x) varying by subgroup.

**Replications.** ≥ 200 per configuration.

**Sample sizes.** N ∈ {2000, 5000, 10000}.

**Expert label budget.** B ∈ {100, 500, 1000, 2000} to produce budget vs. performance curves. All methods compared under identical total budget.

**LLMs.** Three annotators: GPT-4.1 (proprietary frontier), Qwen 3.5 (open-source large), Llama 3.3 (open-source, different family). Fourth LLM as appendix robustness check.

### Comparison Methods (all under fixed expert annotation budget B)

1. **Uncorrected**: LLM annotations used directly as effect modifiers in causal forest.
2. **Globally-corrected**: Single confusion matrix → corrected annotations → causal forest.
3. **Arm-specific (Mozer-style)**: Separate confusion matrices for treatment/control arms → causal forest.
4. **SIMEX + causal forest**: SIMEX-based measurement error correction → causal forest.
5. **Calibration-only + causal forest**: Platt scaling / temperature scaling → calibrated probabilities as soft effect modifiers → causal forest.
6. **EC-HTE (full)**: Hierarchical Bayesian subgroup-specific correction → sandwich-adjusted causal forest → adaptive allocation.

### Evaluation Metrics

- **PEHE**: √E[(τ̂(x) − τ(x))²], overall and per-subgroup.
- **Subgroup CATE bias**: |E[τ̂_g] − τ_g| for each subgroup g.
- **CI empirical coverage**: Fraction of replications where true CATE falls within 95% CI (target: 0.95).
- **CI width**: Efficiency measure at fixed coverage.
- **GATE RMSE**: RMSE of group average treatment effect estimates.
- **Bound tightness**: Observed bias vs. theoretical bound prediction.

### Ablation Studies

**Stage 1 ablation (partial pooling):**
- (a) Hierarchical Bayesian with VI (partial pooling)
- (b) Per-subgroup independent confusion matrices (no pooling)
- (c) Single global confusion matrix (full pooling)
- (d) Prior sensitivity: 2–3 prior settings (weakly informative, moderately informative, diffuse) on 1–2 representative DGP configurations

**Stage 2 ablation (variance adjustment):**
- (a) Sandwich variance-adjusted CIs
- (b) Bootstrap-based CIs
- (c) Naive CIs (no adjustment)
→ Compare empirical coverage rates.

**Stage 3 ablation (allocation strategy):**
- (a) Joint criterion (misclassification uncertainty × CATE magnitude)
- (b) Misclassification-uncertainty-only allocation
- (c) CATE-magnitude-only allocation
- (d) Uniform allocation
- (e) Pilot ratio sensitivity: 10%, 20%, 30% of B as uniform pilot batch
→ Compare PEHE at fixed total budget B.

**Diagnostic validation:** Systematically vary misclassification heterogeneity and CATE heterogeneity (including correlation direction); produce heatmap of EC-HTE improvement over global correction vs. (product of heterogeneity measures). Verify that the theoretical bound predicts when global correction fails and when it suffices. Specifically demonstrate that global correction is worse than uncorrected in positive-correlation configurations.

**CATE estimator robustness (appendix):** In 1–2 worst-case configurations, replace causal forest with DR-learner to verify EC-HTE's correction generalizes beyond a single CATE estimator.

### Real-Data Application (Ashwin et al., 2025)

**Dataset.** Rohingya refugee interview transcripts (Ashwin et al., Sociological Methods & Research 2025). This dataset's primary role is validating the premise of EC-HTE—that LLM misclassification is differential—rather than evaluating CATE estimation accuracy (the dataset lacks a natural causal structure).

**Validation goals:**
1. **Differential misclassification pattern confirmation**: Quantify and visualize how LLM error rates vary across subgroups defined by refugee status, gender, education.
2. **Leave-expert-out calibration test**: Treat full human labels as ground truth, subsample B expert labels, evaluate whether EC-HTE's hierarchical confusion matrix estimates recover the true subgroup-specific error patterns better than global estimation.
3. **Diagnostic criterion demonstration**: Compute the misclassification-heterogeneity × CATE-heterogeneity product on this dataset (constructing a plausible causal question from available variables) to demonstrate the diagnostic's operability.
4. **Budget curve**: Accuracy of confusion matrix recovery vs. expert label budget B.

CATE estimation accuracy is rigorously evaluated in the semi-synthetic experiments where ground-truth CATE is known.

## Scope and Limitations

EC-HTE targets **categorical effect modifiers** (stance, topic, sentiment, entity type, etc.)—the dominant use case when LLM annotations serve as moderators in computational social science. When the effect modifier is a continuous variable that has been discretized (binned), misclassification includes both LLM errors and discretization error; the current framework does not disentangle these sources. Extension to continuous effect modifiers with measurement error (where SIMEX-type approaches may be more natural) is future work.

## Broader Applicability

While our validation focuses on CSS, the same problem structure arises whenever ML-predicted categorical variables serve as effect modifiers: in medical research (ML-classified tumor subtypes as moderators of drug efficacy), education (NLP-coded classroom behaviors moderating intervention effects), and policy evaluation (automated classification of administrative characteristics). EC-HTE's framework and diagnostic criterion apply directly to these settings.

## Expected Contributions

EC-HTE provides (1) the first formal identification of measurement-error-induced CATE distortion in LLM-annotated pipelines, including the proof that global correction can worsen estimates; (2) an actionable diagnostic (the misclassification-heterogeneity × CATE-heterogeneity product) with standalone value for any CATE analysis; (3) a practical three-stage correction framework with valid inference; and (4) comprehensive empirical validation. The framework serves any study using LLM-annotated categorical text variables as effect modifiers in causal analysis.
