The user wants me to write the Introduction section for an EMNLP 2026 paper. Let me carefully follow the story arc and structure provided, adhering to all writing norms (no em-dashes, no -ing phrase endings, no generic openings, etc.).

Let me write this section carefully, following the 5-paragraph structure with the specified word budgets and citations.

Key points to remember:
- No em-dash (—) or explanatory en-dash (–)
- No -ing phrase endings
- No generic openings like "LLMs have shown remarkable capabilities..."


- No consecutive Furthermore/Moreover/Additionally
- Avoid "delve into" / "leverage" / "utilize" / "a myriad of"
- No \begin{document} or \end{document}
- Use \citep{} and \citet{}
- Start with \section{Introduction}
- Contribution list with \begin{itemize} or \begin{enumerate}

Now I'm planning the first paragraph. Recent work like GenRES, LMRC, and DocKS-RAG has pushed document-level relation extraction closer to encoder-based performance, yet these systems only output relation triples without supporting evidence. This creates a critical gap for real-world deployment where users need to verify predictions. I'll start from this specific limitation rather than broad LLM capabilities.

For the second section, I need to explain why evidence matters: relation extraction outputs feed into knowledge graphs and inform human decisions, so missing evidence forces manual verification. Encoder methods like SAIS and DREEAM tackled this by identifying supporting sentences, but LLMs have now surpassed them in extraction accuracy, leaving us with a new problem.

The key distinction I want to highlight is that encoder-based evidence retrieval works differently from generative evidence production. Encoder methods classify sentences as supporting or not, which helps the extraction process itself, whereas LLMs generate evidence text—and this generative approach has a capacity cost that extraction-only methods don't face.

My core insight involves three training paradigms—GRPO, DPO, and RSFT—and three main findings: evidence requirements exist on a spectrum depending on the paradigm, the cost of evidence scales with model size, and RSFT combined with contrastive evidence decoding offers a practical solution. Finally, I'll list five concrete contributions that emerge from this analysis.

Now I'm setting up the output directory and preparing to write this out.

Line 28 ends with "decoupling." which ends with "ing." but this is a noun (the concept "decoupling"), not a present participle phrase ending. Let me verify it's not a -ing participial phrase pattern by checking context.

"decoupling" here is a noun (the concept), not a participial phrase. The rule targets "-ing phrases" like ", demonstrating the effectiveness of..." or ", highlighting the applicability of...". This is fine.

### Assistant

_source line 30_

Introduction 已写入 `docs/paper/sections/introduction.tex`，约 1200 words，5 段结构：

1. **P1** — LLM DocRE 进展但无证据：GenRES/LMRC/DocKS-RAG 逼近 encoder SOTA，但只输出裸三元组，部署场景无法验证
2. **P2** — 可验证证据的必要性：RE 输出进入 KG 和决策流程，encoder 方法 (SAIS/DREEAM) 有证据但精度已落后
3. **P3** — Encoder retrieval ≠ generative production：encoder 证据是辅助信号（helps extraction），生成式证据是额外负担（costs capacity）
4. **P4** — 核心发现：decoupling spectrum、scale-dependent evidence tax、RSFT+CED 方案
5. **P5** — 5 条贡献列表（enumerate 格式）

风格检查通过：无 em-dash、无解释性 en-dash、无 -ing 短语结尾、无连续过渡词、无黑名单用词。
