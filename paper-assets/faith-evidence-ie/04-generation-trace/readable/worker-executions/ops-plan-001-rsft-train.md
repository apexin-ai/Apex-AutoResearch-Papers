The training script failed because the argument is `--rsft_data_path`, not `--train_data`. Also looking at the other args: `--num_epochs` not `--num_train_epochs`, `--per_device_batch_size` not `--per_device_train_batch_size`, and `--quantize` is a flag (with `--no-quantize` being the negation, but let me check - it might be `--quantize` as a store_true with no negative form).

Let me check the actual argument names from the usage output:
- `--rsft_data_path` (not --train_data)


- `--num_epochs` (not --num_train_epochs)
- `--per_device_batch_size` (not --per_device_train_batch_size)
- `--quantize` flag exists (the user used `--no-quantize` which might work as argparse negation)

I need to resubmit with the correct argument names and verify the exact script arguments first.

参数名不匹配，脚本需要 `--rsft_data_path` 而非 `--train_data`，还有 `--num_epochs` / `--per_device_batch_size`。查一下完整参数。

So the arguments are:
- `--base_model` (not `--model_name`)
- `--sft_adapter`
- `--rsft_data_path` (not `--train_data`)
- `--output_dir`
- `--learning_rate`
- `--num_epochs` (not `--num_train_epochs`)
- `--per_device_batch_size` (not `--per_device_train_batch_size`)


- `--gradient_accumulation_steps`
- `--warmup_steps`
- `--save_steps`
- `--save_total_limit`
- `--max_length`
- `--seed`
- `--wandb_project`
- `--wandb_run_name`
- `--weighted_sampling`
- `--quantize` (flag)
- `--lora_rank`
- `--lora_alpha`
- `--lora_dropout`
- `--bf16`
- `--deepspeed`
- `--eval_data_dir`
- `--eval_max_docs`
- `--max_new_tokens`
- `--max_steps`

Now I'm mapping the user's command-line arguments to what the actual script expects: `--model_name` maps to `--base_model`, `--train_data` becomes `--rsft_data_path`, `--num_train_epochs` is `--num_epochs`, and `--per_device_train_batch_size` translates to `--per_device_batch_size`. For the quantization flag, I need to figure out whether `--quantize` uses `store_true` or `BooleanOptionalAction` — if it's the former, I just omit the flag for no quantization, but if it's the latter, I'd need `--no-quantize`. Since the script already errored on `--train_data`, I'll skip passing `--quantize` entirely and assume the default is no quantization.

The previous job exited with code 2, so the tmux session is done and I need to resubmit. I'm constructing the corrected command with the proper argument mappings and environment variables set up. I'm setting up the training command with quantization disabled by default, since the `--quantize` flag is a boolean store_true parameter.

脚本参数名与任务描述不一致。根据 usage 修正：`--base_model`、`--rsft_data_path`、`--num_epochs`、`--per_device_batch_size`，去掉 `--no-quantize`（默认不量化）。重新提交。

The job is starting - it loaded the tokenizer and 2691 RSFT samples. But the GPU hasn't shown the process yet (model is still loading). Let me check one more time in a moment to confirm GPU allocation.

Actually wait - nvidia-smi only shows one process (214562) now. The previous process 216361 is gone. The new process 219556 hasn't allocated GPU memory yet because it's still loading the model from CPU. Let me check one more time.
