Based on the search results, I found relevant information about the Stengel-Eskin et al. work on scope ambiguity in LLMs, though the specific TACL 2024 paper appears to be by different authors (Kamath and Schuster).

The TACL 2024 paper investigates how different versions of autoregressive language models—GPT-2, GPT-3/3.5, Llama 2, and GPT-4—treat scope ambiguous sentences, and compares this with human judgments. The research introduces novel datasets containing almost 1,000 unique scope-ambiguous sentences with interactions between various semantic operators, annotated for human judgments.

Regarding the Stengel-Eskin et al. work (2023), which is referenced in this paper: Their work assesses how LLMs treat ambiguous inputs in terms of semantic parsing, using templates to generate ambiguous sentences including scope-ambiguous ones along with logical parses, and assesses LLMs' ability to properly produce the two logical parses of each ambiguous sentence. They find that models are poor at generating both parses of ambiguous sentences in zero-shot contexts, but can more accurately generate both parses in few-shot contexts.

The question "Did the model understand the question" appears to relate to evaluating whether LLMs can correctly identify and handle the multiple interpretations present in ambiguous sentences—a core theme in this research on scope ambiguity.

I found the research paper you were looking for! Here are the key details:

"To Know or Not To Know? Analyzing Self-Consistency of Large Language Models under Ambiguity" focuses on entity type ambiguity, analyzing the proficiency and consistency of state-of-the-art LLMs in applying factual knowledge when prompted with ambiguous entities.

The researchers proposed an evaluation protocol that disentangles knowing from applying knowledge, and tested state-of-the-art LLMs on 49 entities, revealing that LLMs perform poorly with ambiguous prompts, achieving only 80% accuracy.

The results demonstrate systematic discrepancies in LLM behavior and their failure to consistently apply information, indicating that the models can exhibit knowledge without being able to utilize it, show significant biases for preferred readings, as well as self-inconsistencies.

The paper was submitted on July 24, 2024, with the final version (v3) revised on October 4, 2024. It was authored by Anastasiia Sedova, Robert Litschko, Diego Frassinelli, Benjamin Roth, and Barbara Plank, and published at EMNLP 2024 (November 12-16, 2024).

The full paper is available on arXiv at [https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17125](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17125).

Based on the search results, I found several relevant studies on LLM implicature processing. Here are the key findings:

## Overview of Research on LLM Implicature Processing

Evaluating the pragmatic understanding ability of large language models (LLMs) has drawn considerable attention in recent years as LLMs show remarkable ability for language understanding. Recent studies have evaluated LLMs' pragmatic reasoning in multiple aspects, including scalar inference, discourse connectives, gradable adjectives and conversational implicatures.

## Key Findings on Implicature Resolution

A notable 2022 study found that implicature resolution is a challenging task for LLMs. All pre-trained models obtain close to random zero-shot accuracy (around 60%), whereas humans obtain 86%. However, instruction-tuning at the example level is important for pragmatic understanding. Models fine-tuned with this method perform much better than others.

## Types of Implicatures Studied

Hu et al. (2023) focus on conversational implicatures, testing models' ability to infer pragmatic meanings in dialogue. Additionally, researchers have examined scalar implicatures and manner implicatures as distinct aspects of pragmatic reasoning in language models.

The research demonstrates that while LLMs have limitations in pragmatic understanding out-of-the-box, appropriate training approaches can significantly improve their ability to process implicatures.

I found the paper you're looking for! The paper by Hu et al. (actually authored by Laura Ruis and colleagues, based on the search results) is titled "The Goldilocks of Pragmatic Understanding: Fine-Tuning Strategy Matters for Implicature Resolution by LLMs." It investigates whether large language models can resolve conversational implicatures using a public dataset and evaluation protocol.

The study found that implicature resolution is a challenging task for LLMs, with all pre-trained models obtaining close to random zero-shot accuracy (around 60%), whereas humans achieve 86% accuracy. 

However, the results suggest that instruction-tuning at the example level is important for pragmatic understanding, with models fine-tuned using this method performing much better than others and showing the best scaling properties.

The paper is available on arXiv (arxiv.org/abs/2210.14986) and was originally submitted in October 2022.

Based on the search results, I found the paper you're looking for. 

The paper "The Goldilocks of Pragmatic Understanding: Fine-Tuning Strategy Matters for Implicature Resolution by LLMs" was authored by Laura Ruis, Akbir Khan, Stella Biderman, Sara Hooker, Tim Rocktäschel, and Edward Grefenstette, and presented at NeurIPS 2023.

The paper investigates whether LLMs have the ability to interpret language in context by incorporating its pragmatics. To investigate whether LLMs can make the type of inference known as an implicature, the authors designed a simple task and evaluated four categories of widely used state-of-the-art models. An example of implicature discussed in the paper is understanding the response "I wore gloves" to the question "Did you leave fingerprints?" as meaning "No".

Note: The paper was originally posted to arXiv in October 2022, with updates through December 2023, so it's technically a 2023 publication rather than 2024.

To investigate whether LLMs can make the type of inference known as an implicature, the authors designed a simple task and evaluated four categories of widely used state-of-the-art models. An example of implicature discussed in the paper is understanding the response \"I wore gloves\" to the question \"Did you leave fingerprints?\" as meaning \"No\".\n\nNote: The paper was originally posted to arXiv in October 2022, with updates through December 2023, so it's technically a 2023 publication rather than 2024."

OK so let me sort this out:

1. **Stengel-Eskin et al. (TACL 2024)** — The search results suggest this is actually "Scope Ambiguities in Large Language Models" by Gaurav Kamath and Sebastian Schuster, published in TACL 2024. Let me check if Stengel-Eskin is an author. Looking at the first search, I see "Elias Stengel-Eskin" has a homepage but the TACL 2024 paper seems to be by Kamath and Schuster. Let me search more specifically for Stengel-Eskin's work.


2. **"To Know or Not To Know" (2024)** — That's the Sedova et al. paper from EMNLP 2024 Findings, arXiv 2407.17125. Got that one pinned down. Now I need to track down the Hu et al. 2022 paper on implicature—the "Goldilocks" paper might actually be by Ruis et al. instead. And I'm still looking for the full details on Ruis et al. 2024.

3. **Ruis et al.** — Found it. The paper's "The Goldilocks of Pragmatic Understanding: Fine-Tuning Strategy Matters for Implicature Resolution by LLMs" was originally on arXiv in 2022 but published at NeurIPS 2023, not 2024 like I initially thought.

Now I need to search more carefully for Stengel-Eskin and the actual Hu et al. paper.

1	\section{Related Work}
2	\label{sec:related_work}
3	
4	\paragraph{Ambiguity in NLP and requirements engineering.}
5	Ambiguity has been studied extensively in both computational linguistics and software engineering. Word sense disambiguation \citep{navigli_wsd_2009} addresses lexical ambiguity at the token level; our lexical type extends this to policy-specific polysemy. \citet{li_ambiguity_taxonomy_2024} propose an 11-type NLP taxonomy covering syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic ambiguity, from which we draw our linguistic-layer types. In requirements engineering (RE), \citet{massey_ambiguity_re_2014} classify six ambiguity types in regulatory texts, and \citet{berry_kamsties_2004} introduce the distinction between nocuous ambiguity (where stakeholders diverge on interpretation) and innocuous ambiguity (where they converge). Computational detection of nocuous ambiguity has progressed from heuristic methods \citep{chantree_2006,willis_nocuous_2008} through NLP-based cross-domain detectors \citep{ferrari_ambiguity_2019,ferrari_defects_2018} to transformer-based approaches for anaphoric ambiguity \citep{ezzini_taphsir_2022,ezzini_anaphoric_2022}. \citet{zhao_nlp4re_2021} survey the broader NLP4RE landscape. Our work extends Berry and Kamsties' framework to LLM agents, where the absence of shared organizational context makes previously innocuous ambiguity nocuous.
6	
7	\paragraph{Psycholinguistics of ambiguity processing.}
8	\citet{ferreira_good_enough_2002} show that human comprehenders build shallow, ``good-enough'' representations rather than full parses, paralleling our observation that LLM agents adopt surface interpretations. \citet{frazier_rayner_1982} demonstrate early commitment to a single parse; \citet{li_garden_path_llm_2024} provide direct evidence that LLMs exhibit analogous garden-path effects. \citet{liu_ambiguity_2023} demonstrate that language models fail to represent ambiguity, collapsing multiple interpretations into a single output. These findings ground our \emph{Disambiguation Neglect} result: agents process ambiguous input without meta-cognitive awareness but, unlike humans, lack social channels to recover. \citet{suri_structured_2025} show that structured uncertainty estimation improves coverage by 7--39\%, while \citet{sehwag_aspi_2026} demonstrate that clarification-seeking introduces prompt injection vulnerabilities---a tension for disambiguation channel design.
9	
10	\paragraph{Agent safety evaluation.}
11	The agent safety evaluation landscape includes benchmarks for risk awareness \citep{rjudge_2024}, tool-use safety \citep{toolemu_2024}, indirect prompt injection \citep{injecagent_2024}, safe task planning \citep{yin_safeagentbench_2025}, and policy-invisible violations \citep{phantompolicy_2026}. \citet{tamkin_evaluating_2023} evaluate how language models navigate policy-governed decisions, \citet{shieldagent_2025} extract formal safety rules from policy documents, and AgentAuditor \citep{agentauditor_2025} achieves human-level safety evaluation. Our work differs by focusing on the \emph{source specification} rather than the agent's execution: we measure how ambiguity in the policy itself causes safety violations, complementing work that assumes clean policies.
12	
13	\paragraph{Policy specification for agents.}
14	DRIP-R \citep{drip_r_2026} is the closest concurrent work: it benchmarks 400 policy-ambiguous retail scenarios across five RE ambiguity types, measuring decision quality rather than safety violations. Our work differs in three respects: (1) our matched-pair design establishes causality rather than correlating ambiguity presence with outcomes; (2) we measure safety violations rather than decision quality, enabling failure mechanism analysis; (3) our two-layer taxonomy adds linguistic-layer types, and we quantify the model$\times$type interaction. We map DRIP-R's five RE ambiguity categories to our six-type taxonomy in Appendix~\ref{app:drip_mapping}. PolicyBank \citep{policybank_2026} studies iterative policy refinement, closing 82\% of the gap to a human oracle. AgentPex \citep{agentpex_2026} detects procedural violations in agentic traces, finding that 83\% of perfect-outcome traces contain violations. MANTRA \citep{mantra_2026} synthesizes SMT-validated compliance benchmarks from procedural manuals. $\tau$-bench \citep{tau_bench_2024} and its successor $\tau^2$-bench \citep{tau2_bench_2025} provide the conversational agent evaluation platforms.

Based on the search results, I found relevant information about Jennifer Hu's work on pragmatics and language models. Here are the key findings:

Jennifer Hu, along with Sammy Floyd, Olessia Jouravlev, Evelina Fedorenko, and Edward Gibson, published "A fine-grained comparison of pragmatic language understanding in humans and language models" in 2023 in the Proceedings of the 61st Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics.

Regarding the study's findings on implicature and pragmatic understanding: The largest models achieve high accuracy and match human error patterns, with models favoring literal interpretations over heuristic-based distractors, and preliminary evidence that models and humans are sensitive to similar linguistic cues. The results suggest that pragmatic behaviors can emerge in models without explicitly constructed representations of mental states, though models tend to struggle with phenomena relying on social expectation violations.

Additionally, Hu, Levy, and Schuster published work on "Predicting scalar diversity with context-driven uncertainty over alternatives" in the Proceedings of the ACL Workshop on Cognitive Modeling and Computational Linguistics (2022), which relates to implicature understanding in language models.

The results suggest that pragmatic behaviors can emerge in models without explicitly constructed representations of mental states, though models tend to struggle with phenomena relying on social expectation violations.\n\nAdditionally, Hu, Levy, and Schuster published work on \"Predicting scalar diversity with context-driven uncertainty over alternatives\" in the Proceedings of the ACL Workshop on Cognitive Modeling and Computational Linguistics (2022), which relates to implicature understanding in language models."

Based on the web search results, I found relevant information about Stengel-Eskin's work on ambiguity in NLP, though the specific "Did the model understand the question" framing appears in a broader context of their research.

Stengel-Eskin et al.'s 2024 work addresses ambiguity in semantic parsing, building on earlier research. Their 2023 work assessed how large language models treat ambiguous inputs in semantic parsing by using templates to generate ambiguous sentences along with logical parses and assessing LLMs' ability to produce both parses of ambiguous sentences in few-shot and zero-shot contexts.

The authors found that models are poor at generating both parses of ambiguous sentences in zero-shot contexts, but can more accurately generate both parses in few-shot contexts.

More broadly, Stengel-Eskin's research focuses on developing AI agents that can intelligently communicate and collaborate with people, including work on handling uncertainty, ambiguity, and underspecification.

The search results also show that Stengel-Eskin et al. focused on ambiguity in visual question answering (VQA) and proposed a rephrasing method for disambiguation.

Now I need to look more specifically at the TACL 2024 paper on scope ambiguity. The search results consistently point to "Scope Ambiguities in Large Language Models" published in TACL 2024, but the authors seem to be Kamath and Schuster, not Stengel-Eskin. Let me check if Stengel-Eskin is actually a co-author.

Also, for Hu et al. (2022) on implicature processing - the search found:
- Jennifer Hu et al. (2023 ACL) "A fine-grained comparison of pragmatic language understanding in humans and language models"


- The arXiv version is from 2212.06801 (December 2022)

So Hu et al. (2022/2023) is likely the paper the user is referring to. It was posted to arXiv in Dec 2022 and published at ACL 2023.

For Ruis et al., I'm seeing "The Goldilocks of Pragmatic Understanding" was published at NeurIPS 2023, not 2024, so I should search again to see if there's a more recent 2024 paper by Ruis. I also need to do a more targeted search for the TACL 2024 scope ambiguity paper and verify Stengel-Eskin's involvement.

A Case Study in Open-world   Question Answering","url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.12395"}]

Based on the search results, I found relevant information about Elias Stengel-Eskin's work on ambiguity and model understanding. While the exact title "Did the model understand the question" doesn't appear in these results, I found related work:

Stengel-Eskin published "Zero and Few-shot Semantic Parsing with Ambiguous Inputs" at ICLR 2024, and he also has work titled "Did You Mean...? Confidence-based Trade-offs in Semantic Parsing" and "Calibrated Interpretation: Confidence Estimation in Semantic Parsing".

Stengel-Eskin's research covers calibration and uncertainty especially in connection with implicit phenomena such as vagueness, underspecification, and ambiguity. His work on studying the distribution of interpretations has been used as a natural way for ambiguity detection.

The search results indicate that Stengel-Eskin has published multiple papers on ambiguity in language models around 2023-2024, focusing on how models understand and handle ambiguous questions and inputs. If you're looking for a specific 2024 arXiv paper with that exact title, you may want to search directly on arXiv or provide additional details about the paper.

I found the paper! Here are the key details:

**Title:** Scope Ambiguities in Large Language Models

**Authors:** Gaurav Kamath, Sebastian Schuster, Sowmya Vajjala, and Siva Reddy

**Publication:** Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 12:738–754 (2024)

**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1162/tacl_a_00670

**Overview:** Sentences containing multiple semantic operators with overlapping scope often create ambiguities in interpretation, known as scope ambiguities. These ambiguities offer rich insights into the interaction between semantic structure and world knowledge in language processing.

**Methodology:** The paper introduces novel datasets that contain a joint total of almost 1,000 unique scope-ambiguous sentences, containing interactions between a range of semantic operators, and annotated for human judgments. It investigates how different versions of certain autoregressive language models—GPT-2, GPT-3/3.5, Llama 2, and GPT-4—treat scope ambiguous sentences, and compares this with human judgments.

**Key Findings:** Several models are sensitive to the meaning ambiguity in these sentences, in a way that patterns well with human judgments, and can successfully identify human-preferred readings at a high level of accuracy (over 90% in some cases).

The paper and code are also available on GitHub at: https://github.com/McGill-NLP/scope-ambiguity

Now I have a clearer picture. Let me summarize what I found:

1. **Stengel-Eskin et al. (TACL 2024)** — The actual TACL 2024 paper on scope ambiguity in LLMs is by **Kamath, Schuster, Vajjala, and Reddy** (not Stengel-Eskin). The paper is "Scope Ambiguities in Large Language Models" published in TACL 2024, Volume 12, pages 738-754. DOI: 10.1162/tacl_a_00670.


2. Stengel-Eskin's work on semantic parsing with ambiguous inputs came out at ICLR 2024, which is a different paper entirely. Looking back at the author list for the TACL paper, I can confirm it's Kamath and Schuster as the lead authors, with the full team including Vajjala and Reddy. The search results point to Kamath et al.'s TACL 2024 paper on scope ambiguity in LLMs as the actual match for what the user referenced, so I should use that instead of trying to force a connection to Stengel-Eskin. Let me verify the authorship and confirm this is the right paper to cite. I can't find a TACL 2024 paper specifically by Stengel-Eskin on this topic, even though he does work on ambiguity. Given the user's instruction not to fabricate citations, I should go with the Kamath et al. paper since it matches the topic and venue perfectly, or skip this reference if I can't verify it.

Now I'm searching more specifically for "To Know or Not To Know" and finding a 2024 paper by Sedova and Litschko on how LLMs handle ambiguity and self-consistency.

For the Hu et al. reference, I'm checking whether the pragmatic language understanding paper actually covers implicature or if there's a different work I should be looking at.

Now I'm identifying the Ruis et al. paper on fine-tuning strategies for implicature resolution in language models. Now I'm going through each paper to verify the correct publication years and details. Kamath et al. is indeed TACL 2024 on scope ambiguity, Sedova et al. appeared in EMNLP Findings 2024, and I need to correct the user's years for both Hu et al. (actually ACL 2023, not 2022) and Ruis et al. (NeurIPS 2023, not 2024). I'll use the accurate citations going forward. I'm tracking down the complete author list and publication details for the Ruis paper—it looks like it was submitted to arXiv in October 2022 but published at a 2023 venue, so I need to verify which conference that actually was. I'm getting caught up in the details here. Let me just do one more targeted search to pin down the exact venue for the Ruis paper and confirm the full author list for the Kamath work, then I can move forward with what I have.

Based on the search results, here's what I found about the paper:

## Paper Information

The paper is titled "The Goldilocks of Pragmatic Understanding: Fine-Tuning Strategy Matters for Implicature Resolution by LLMs" with authors Ruis, Khan, Biderman, Hooker, Rocktäschel, and Grefenstette.

## Venue and Proceedings

The paper was published in NeurIPS 2023 (Spotlight), specifically in the Proceedings of the 37th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) held in New Orleans, LA, USA.

## Research Focus

The paper addresses how evaluations of LLMs as conversational agents fail to capture a crucial aspect of communication: interpreting language in context—incorporating its pragmatics. The researchers design a task and evaluate four categories of widely used state-of-the-art models, finding that models in three of these categories perform close to random on binary inference utterances, though LLMs instruction-tuned at the example-level perform significantly better.

Now I have all the information I need. Let me also check the Sedova et al. details one more time.

For the "To Know or Not To Know" paper, I found:
- Title: "To Know or Not To Know? Analyzing Self-Consistency of Large Language Models under Ambiguity"
- Authors: Anastasiia Sedova, Robert Litschko, Diego Frassinelli, Benjamin Roth, Barbara Plank
- Venue: Findings of EMNLP 2024
- arXiv: 2407.17125

Let me now read the appendix.tex file and then make all the edits.


Now I'm compiling the complete details for all four papers. The Kamath et al. paper on scope ambiguities is from TACL 2024 with the correct authors and DOI, which is what the user actually needed for the scopal ambiguity section. The Sedova et al. paper on self-consistency under ambiguity is confirmed for EMNLP Findings 2024. I'm moving on to review the appendix file to continue with the next part.

2	\label{app:tost}
3	
4	Table~\ref{tab:tost_sensitivity} reports the TOST equivalence analysis \citep{lakens_2017} across seven margins. Three pairs involving incompleteness never reach equivalence even at $\pm 20$ pp: conditional precedence--incompleteness ($\Delta = 16.8$ pp), coreferential--incompleteness ($\Delta = 22.0$ pp), and incompleteness--scopal ($\Delta = 14.2$ pp).

27	\label{app:mitigation}
28	
29	Table~\ref{tab:mitigation} reports the per-type, per-model $\Delta$pp from the disambiguation-instruction mitigation experiment (1,256 treatment episodes across five of six types; coreferential was not tested). Coreferential pairs are excluded from both the mitigation and replication experiments. In mitigation, their ambiguous and unambiguous variants differ only in pronoun resolution, making it impossible to craft targeted disambiguation instructions without revealing the experimental manipulation. In replication, the $\tau^2$-bench episode design for coreferential ambiguity is tightly coupled to the original five-model configuration; extending it to new model families would require redesigning the episode templates, which falls outside the scope of this confirmatory replication. The treatment appends a type-specific disambiguation instruction to the agent's system prompt. Control rates are the matched 5-type subset from the full study (\S\ref{sec:results}).

75	\section{Ambiguity Type Detection Experiment}
76	\label{app:detection}
77	
78	To assess whether our taxonomy supports automated identification, we conduct a proof-of-concept detection experiment using GPT-4.1 as a zero-shot classifier. Given a policy clause, the classifier determines (1)~whether it contains ambiguity and (2)~the specific type from a five-type subset of our taxonomy. Coreferential ambiguity is excluded because its variants are lexically identical to their unambiguous counterparts, making surface-level type detection inapplicable.
79	
80	We evaluate on 500 policy clauses (250 ambiguous, 250 unambiguous) using stratified 5-fold cross-validation, with clause pairs kept in the same fold to prevent leakage. Table~\ref{tab:detection} reports per-type results.
81	
82	\begin{table}[!ht]

86	\label{tab:detection}
87	\begin{tabular}{lrrr}

89	Type & Prec. & Recall & F1 \\

97	No ambiguity & 0.76 & 0.96 & 0.85 \\
98	\bottomrule
99	\end{tabular}
100	\end{table}
101	
102	Detection difficulty is inversely correlated with agent vulnerability: incompleteness, the most dangerous type (53.6\% violation rate, \S\ref{sec:results}), is the hardest to detect (F1\,=\,0.34), while conditional precedence (36.8\% violation rate) is the easiest (F1\,=\,0.94). This asymmetry arises because types with overt linguistic signals (e.g., conditional structures) are readily detectable but only moderately dangerous, whereas missing information leaves no surface trace for a classifier to exploit.
103	
104	The primary confusion pathway is authorization scope $\to$ lexical (48\% of authorization scope clauses): authorization boundary clauses frequently contain polysemous terms, causing the classifier to attribute the ambiguity to word-level rather than permission-level underspecification.
105	
106	These results position automated detection as a viable first-pass screening tool (binary F1\,=\,0.81) but an unreliable type classifier, particularly for the highest-risk types. The classifier was evaluated on synthetic clauses derived from $\tau^2$-bench; generalization to naturally occurring policy documents requires further validation.
107	
108	\section{Replication on Additional Model Families}
109	\label{app:model_expansion}
110	
111	To test cross-architecture generalization beyond the five main-study models, we replicate the core analyses on two additional model families: Gemini-2.5-Flash (Google) and LLaMA-4-Scout (Meta), each with 250 clause pairs $\times$ 2 conditions $= 500$ episodes judged by GPT-5.4. These models represent two additional providers not in the original study. We exclude coreferential ambiguity because its disambiguation relies on benchmark-specific assertion structure rather than clause-level text changes (\S\ref{sec:taxonomy}), limiting cross-benchmark generalizability. Tables~\ref{tab:expansion_overall} and~\ref{tab:expansion_pertype} report the results.

147	\paragraph{C1 replication.} Both models show significant binary ambiguity effects (Gemini $\Delta = +33.6$\,pp, OR $= 14.5$, $p < 10^{-21}$; LLaMA $\Delta = +20.0$\,pp, OR $= 2.8$, $p < 10^{-6}$), extending C1 to seven models across six providers. Gemini's effect size falls within the original five-model range (+25.7 to +39.0\,pp). LLaMA's smaller effect and lower OR are attributable to an elevated unambiguous baseline (17.6\% vs.\ $<$10\% for all other models), suggesting weaker baseline instruction following that compresses the ambiguity-specific delta. LLaMA 3.3's elevated unambiguous baseline (17.6\% vs.\ 7.3--12.7\% for main-study models) likely reflects weaker baseline instruction following, suggesting that absolute violation rates are model-dependent even absent ambiguity.
148	
149	\paragraph{C2 replication.} Both models' type rankings correlate positively with the original pooled ranking. LLaMA shows a strong and significant correlation ($\rho = 0.90$, $p = 0.037$), with incompleteness as the top type and the bottom three types matching the reference order exactly. Gemini shows a moderate positive correlation ($\rho = 0.60$, $p = 0.285$), with the top two types (lexical and incompleteness) swapped relative to the reference. Incompleteness remains $\geq$46\% in all seven models (range: 46--62\%), confirming its status as a consistent vulnerability independent of architecture or provider. $^*$Significant at $\alpha = 0.05$.
150	
151	\section{Incompleteness Confound Analysis}
152	\label{app:confound}
153	
154	Incompleteness is structurally distinct from the other five types: its unambiguous variant necessarily adds policy content (specifying what was previously missing) rather than merely resolving an existing ambiguity. This raises a confound: the 49.2 pp effect may partly reflect the information addition rather than ambiguity resolution per se.
155	
156	A logistic regression controlling for per-clause information delta (token count difference between ambiguous and unambiguous variants) confirms that incompleteness remains individually significant ($p = 0.022$, coefficient change $< 8\%$ relative to the uncontrolled model). Coreferential ambiguity, whose variants are lexically identical (information delta $= 0$), provides a confound-free lower bound: its 31.6\% violation rate and 18.7 pp effect are entirely attributable to semantic ambiguity. Token count is a coarse proxy for information content; finer-grained semantic measures (e.g., propositional content analysis) may reveal different confound structures.
157	
158	Per-type token deltas between unambiguous and ambiguous variants range from 17.5 words (conditional precedence) to 36.1 words (authorization scope). Notably, authorization scope has the largest delta (36.1) yet lower violation rates than incompleteness (delta 34.6), providing counter-evidence against a pure information-quantity explanation: if token delta drove violations, authorization scope should exceed incompleteness. Coreferential pairs have zero token delta (lexically identical variants), providing a confound-free baseline.
159	
160	Excluding incompleteness entirely, the pooled ambiguity effect remains large and significant ($\Delta = 31.0$\,pp, OR $= 7.75$, $p < 10^{-75}$), confirming that C1 does not depend on any single type.
161	
162	Excluding incompleteness, the remaining five types show a non-significant omnibus difference ($\chi^2$, $p = 0.079$), but pairwise contrasts with Holm--Bonferroni correction reveal a graded risk pattern: authorization scope ($p_{\text{adj}} = 0.039$) and lexical ($p_{\text{adj}} = 0.025$) remain significantly above coreferential, while the four remaining pairs are equivalent at the $\pm 15$ pp margin.
163	
164	\section{Per-Type Judge Reliability}
165	\label{app:per_type_agreement}
166	
167	Table~\ref{tab:per_type_agreement} reports per-type human--LLM binary agreement ($\kappa$) on the 100-episode stratified sample (200 human--LLM rating pairs: two annotators $\times$ corresponding LLM judge). Per-type samples range from 32 to 34 episodes, yielding wide confidence intervals.

176	Type & $n$ & $\kappa$ & 95\% CI \\
177	\midrule
178	Lexical & 32 & 0.904 & $[0.64, 1.00]$ \\
179	Cond.\ precedence & 34 & 0.837 & $[0.53, 1.00]$ \\
180	Incompleteness & 34 & 0.795 & $[0.56, 1.00]$ \\

186	\bottomrule
187	\end{tabular}
188	\end{table}
189	
190	Descriptively, authorization scope has the lowest human--LLM $\kappa$ among the four substantively high-rate types (0.644), consistent with its lowest cross-judge $\kappa$ (0.385, \S\ref{sec:method}). Both reflect the inherent difficulty of permission-boundary judgments rather than systematic judge failure: raw agreement is still 85.0\%, and the 34\,pp within-judge-group range (\S\ref{sec:c4}) far exceeds measurement noise. Coreferential's low $\kappa$ (0.479) reflects the prevalence paradox---its violation base rate is 8.8\%, compressing the $\kappa$ denominator despite 85.0\% raw agreement. Per-type estimates are imprecise due to small cell sizes ($n = 32$--$34$); they are descriptive statistics only and should not be used for type-level reliability ranking or inference.
191	
192	\section{Information Delta Logistic Regression}
193	\label{app:regression}
194	
195	Table~\ref{tab:logistic_regression} reports the full logistic regression controlling for token-count difference between ambiguous and unambiguous variants (information delta). The reference category is authorization scope (type) and Claude Sonnet 4.6 (model). Token delta is significant ($p < 0.001$) but small in magnitude (OR $= 1.022$ per token), indicating that information quantity partially confounds the type effect. Critically, incompleteness remains individually significant ($p = 0.018$) after controlling for token delta, with a coefficient change of $<$8\% relative to the model without the covariate. The slightly lower $p$-value compared to the univariate confound control in Appendix~\ref{app:confound} ($p = 0.022$) reflects the additional variance absorbed by model covariates in the full specification.

224	
225	\section{Bootstrap Cluster Analysis}
226	\label{app:cluster}
227	
228	To complement the margin-dependent TOST analysis, we apply Ward's hierarchical clustering to the six observed type-level violation rates, bootstrapped $B = 10{,}000$ times by resampling clause pairs within each type. At $k = 2$, incompleteness (53.6\%) forms a singleton cluster, with the remaining five types (31.6--42.8\%) in the second cluster, reproducing in 34.3\% of bootstrap samples---the most frequent partition but not overwhelmingly stable, reflecting that the 10.8\,pp gap between incompleteness and lexical is moderate relative to within-type variance. At $k = 3$, coreferential (31.6\%) additionally separates, consistent with the TOST equivalence structure. The AU $p$-value for the incompleteness singleton is 0.47, confirming that while the singleton is the modal partition, the boundary is not sharp.
229	
230	\section{Clause-Level Variance}
231	\label{app:clause_variance}
232	
233	Leave-one-out analysis confirms that no single clause drives any type-level rate: maximum LOO shift is 1.4\,pp (coreferential), and all types have LOO ranges $\leq$2.1\,pp. Within-type coefficients of variation (CV) range from 0.69 (incompleteness) to 1.03 (coreferential), confirming high clause-level heterogeneity. This heterogeneity is expected---clause wording determines the specific ambiguity instance---and is controlled by the matched-pair design, which compares each clause's ambiguous and unambiguous variants rather than relying on type-level means.
234	
235	\section{Multiple Comparison Correction}
236	\label{app:multiple_comparison}
237	
238	We apply Holm--Bonferroni correction within three test families: (i) per-type$\times$model McNemar tests for C1 (30 tests), (ii) TOST pairwise equivalence for C2 (15 pairs), and (iii) model$\times$type interaction for C4 (1 omnibus + post-hoc).
239	
240	\section{DRIP-R Category Mapping}
241	\label{app:drip_mapping}
242	
243	DRIP-R's five RE ambiguity categories---attachment, coordination, anaphora, scope, and ellipsis---overlap partially with our six-type taxonomy: scopal ambiguity and coreferential ambiguity correspond directly, while our remaining four types (lexical, authorization scope, incompleteness, conditional precedence) address policy-specific phenomena outside DRIP-R's RE scope.
244	
245	\section{Cross-Model Type Ranking Concordance}
246	\label{app:kendall_w}
247	
248	To quantify agreement among models on the relative difficulty of ambiguity types, we compute Kendall's coefficient of concordance $W$. For the five main-study models across all six types, $W = 0.398$ ($\chi^2(5) = 9.94$, $p = 0.072$), indicating moderate but non-significant concordance. Including the two replication models (Gemini 2.5 Flash and LLaMA 4 Scout) over five shared types (excluding coreferential, which was not included in replication), concordance reaches significance: $W = 0.353$ ($\chi^2(4) = 9.89$, $p = 0.038$). In both analyses, incompleteness consistently ranks highest (mean rank 5.5 / 4.5), while coreferential (2.0, five-model only) and conditional precedence (2.8 / 2.1) rank lowest, supporting the graded risk structure identified in \S\ref{sec:results}.
249	
250	\section{C4 Interaction Without Authorization Scope}
251	\label{app:c4_sans_auth}
252	
253	Excluding authorization scope, the residual model$\times$type interaction vanishes ($\chi^2(16) = 7.13$, $p = 0.97$; logistic regression LR test: $\chi^2(16) = 9.22$, $p = 0.90$), confirming that the C4 interaction is driven entirely by authorization scope---the type most plausibly targeted by differential safety training.
254	
255	\section{Per-Type Clause Length Analysis}
256	\label{app:clause_length}
257	
258	Unambiguous clauses are systematically longer than their ambiguous counterparts across all types (Table~\ref{tab:token_delta}), reflecting the additional specification needed for disambiguation. Authorization scope ($+36.1$ words) and incompleteness ($+34.6$ words) show the largest deltas, consistent with the observation that resolving these types requires substantial additional content. Notably, authorization scope has the largest delta ($+36.1$) yet lower violation rates than incompleteness ($+34.6$ delta), providing counter-evidence against a pure information-quantity explanation of incompleteness's upper-bound status. The confound analysis in Appendix~\ref{app:confound} controls for this length asymmetry.

280	\label{app:judge_group_ranking}
281	
282	Type rankings show near-zero correlation across judge groups (Spearman $\rho = -0.03$, $p = 0.96$). This is driven by authorization scope's rank reversal (rank 1 in GPT-4.1-judged group vs.\ rank 6 in GPT-5.4-judged group), which reflects agent composition: the GPT-4.1-judged group contains the two agents most vulnerable to authorization scope (DeepSeek 60\%, GPT-5.4 64\%), while the GPT-5.4-judged group contains the least vulnerable (Claude 12\%). Incompleteness ranks 1--2 in both groups, supporting its stability independent of judge identity. This finding further motivates treating authorization scope results with caution (\S\ref{sec:limitations}). Excluding authorization scope---the type with lowest inter-judge agreement ($\kappa = 0.385$) and highest cross-model variance (52\,pp range)---the remaining five types show strong cross-group rank correlation (Spearman $\rho = 0.90$, $p = 0.037$), confirming that the near-zero full correlation is driven entirely by authorization scope's model composition effect rather than systematic judge-group bias.

284	\section{Binary Effect Excluding Incompleteness}
285	\label{app:sans_incompleteness}
286	
287	Excluding incompleteness---the highest-violation type---the pooled ambiguous violation rate remains significantly elevated (38.4\% vs.\ 7.5\% unambiguous; $\Delta = 31.0$\,pp, OR $= 7.75$, $\chi^2 = 338.8$, $p < 10^{-75}$). The binary ambiguity effect (C1) is therefore not driven by incompleteness alone.

Coreferential pairs are excluded from both the mitigation and replication experiments. In mitigation, their ambiguous and unambiguous variants differ only in pronoun resolution, making it impossible to craft targeted disambiguation instructions without revealing the experimental manipulation. In replication, the $\\tau^2$-bench episode design for coreferential ambiguity is tightly coupled to the original five-model configuration; extending it to new model families would require redesigning the episode templates, which falls outside the scope of this confirmatory replication.

Given a policy clause, the classifier determines (1)~whether it contains ambiguity and (2)~the specific type from a five-type subset of our taxonomy. Coreferential ambiguity is excluded because its variants are lexically identical to their unambiguous counterparts, making surface-level type detection inapplicable.\n\nWe evaluate on 500 policy clauses (250 ambiguous, 250 unambiguous) using stratified 5-fold cross-validation, with clause pairs kept in the same fold to prevent leakage. Table~\\ref{tab:detection} reports per-type results.\n\n\\begin{table}[!ht]\n\\centering\n\\small\n\\caption{Proof-of-concept detection classifier (GPT-4.1, zero-shot, 5-fold CV).

This asymmetry arises because types with overt linguistic signals (e.g., conditional structures) are readily detectable but only moderately dangerous, whereas missing information leaves no surface trace for a classifier to exploit.\n\nThe primary confusion pathway is authorization scope $\\to$ lexical (48\\% of authorization scope clauses): authorization boundary clauses frequently contain polysemous terms, causing the classifier to attribute the ambiguity to word-level rather than permission-level underspecification.\n\nThese results position automated detection as a viable first-pass screening tool (binary F1\\,=\\,0.81) but an unreliable type classifier, particularly for the highest-risk types. The classifier was evaluated on synthetic clauses derived from $\\tau^2$-bench; generalization to naturally occurring policy documents requires further validation.\n\n\\section{Replication on Additional Model Families}\n\\label{app:model_expansion}\n\nTo test cross-architecture generalization beyond the five main-study models, we replicate the core analyses on two additional model families: Gemini-2.5-Flash (Google) and LLaMA-4-Scout (Meta), each with 250 clause pairs $\\times$ 2 conditions $= 500$ episodes judged by GPT-5.4. These models represent two additional providers not in the original study. We exclude coreferential ambiguity because its disambiguation relies on benchmark-specific assertion structure rather than clause-level text changes (\\S\\ref{sec:taxonomy}), limiting cross-benchmark generalizability. Tables~\\ref{tab:expansion_overall} and~\\ref{tab:expansion_pertype} report the results.\n\n\\begin{table}[!ht]\n\\centering\n\\small\n\\caption{Replication results on two additional model families.

Gemini's effect size falls within the original five-model range (+25.7 to +39.0\\,pp). LLaMA's smaller effect and lower OR are attributable to an elevated unambiguous baseline (17.6\\% vs.\\ $<$10\\% for all other models), suggesting weaker baseline instruction following that compresses the ambiguity-specific delta. LLaMA 3.3's elevated unambiguous baseline (17.6\\% vs.\\ 7.3--12.7\\% for main-study models) likely reflects weaker baseline instruction following, suggesting that absolute violation rates are model-dependent even absent ambiguity.\n\n\\paragraph{C2 replication.} Both models' type rankings correlate positively with the original pooled ranking. LLaMA shows a strong and significant correlation ($\\rho = 0.90$, $p = 0.037$), with incompleteness as the top type and the bottom three types matching the reference order exactly. Gemini shows a moderate positive correlation ($\\rho = 0.60$, $p = 0.285$), with the top two types (lexical and incompleteness) swapped relative to the reference. Incompleteness remains $\\geq$46\\% in all seven models (range: 46--62\\%), confirming its status as a consistent vulnerability independent of architecture or provider. $^*$Significant at $\\alpha = 0.05$.\n\n\\section{Incompleteness Confound Analysis}\n\\label{app:confound}\n\nIncompleteness is structurally distinct from the other five types: its unambiguous variant necessarily adds policy content (specifying what was previously missing) rather than merely resolving an existing ambiguity. This raises a confound: the 49.2 pp effect may partly reflect the information addition rather than ambiguity resolution per se.\n\nA logistic regression controlling for per-clause information delta (token count difference between ambiguous and unambiguous variants) confirms that incompleteness remains individually significant ($p = 0.022$, coefficient change $< 8\\%$ relative to the uncontrolled model). Coreferential ambiguity, whose variants are lexically identical (information delta $= 0$), provides a confound-free lower bound: its 31.6\\% violation rate and 18.7 pp effect are entirely attributable to semantic ambiguity. Token count is a coarse proxy for information content; finer-grained semantic measures (e.g., propositional content analysis) may reveal different confound structures.\n\nPer-type token deltas between unambiguous and ambiguous variants range from 17.5 words (conditional precedence) to 36.1 words (authorization scope). Notably, authorization scope has the largest delta (36.1) yet lower violation rates than incompleteness (delta 34.6), providing counter-evidence against a pure information-quantity explanation: if token delta drove violations, authorization scope should exceed incompleteness. Coreferential pairs have zero token delta (lexically identical variants), providing a confound-free baseline.\n\nExcluding incompleteness entirely, the pooled ambiguity effect remains large and significant ($\\Delta = 31.0$\\,pp, OR $= 7.75$, $p < 10^{-75}$), confirming that C1 does not depend on any single type.\n\nExcluding incompleteness, the remaining five types show a non-significant omnibus difference ($\\chi^2$, $p = 0.079$), but pairwise contrasts with Holm--Bonferroni correction reveal a graded risk pattern: authorization scope ($p_{\\text{adj}} = 0.039$) and lexical ($p_{\\text{adj}} = 0.025$) remain significantly above coreferential, while the four remaining pairs are equivalent at the $\\pm 15$ pp margin.\n\n\\section{Per-Type Judge Reliability}\n\\label{app:per_type_agreement}\n\nTable~\\ref{tab:per_type_agreement} reports per-type human--LLM binary agreement ($\\kappa$) on the 100-episode stratified sample (200 human--LLM rating pairs: two annotators $\\times$ corresponding LLM judge). Per-type samples range from 32 to 34 episodes, yielding wide confidence intervals.\n\n\\begin{table}[!ht]\n\\centering\n\\small\n\\caption{Per-type human--LLM binary agreement (moderate-or-above threshold).

Both reflect the inherent difficulty of permission-boundary judgments rather than systematic judge failure: raw agreement is still 85.0\\%, and the 34\\,pp within-judge-group range (\\S\\ref{sec:c4}) far exceeds measurement noise. Coreferential's low $\\kappa$ (0.479) reflects the prevalence paradox---its violation base rate is 8.8\\%, compressing the $\\kappa$ denominator despite 85.0\\% raw agreement. Per-type estimates are imprecise due to small cell sizes ($n = 32$--$34$); they are descriptive statistics only and should not be used for type-level reliability ranking or inference.\n\n\\section{Information Delta Logistic Regression}\n\\label{app:regression}\n\nTable~\\ref{tab:logistic_regression} reports the full logistic regression controlling for token-count difference between ambiguous and unambiguous variants (information delta). The reference category is authorization scope (type) and Claude Sonnet 4.6 (model). Token delta is significant ($p < 0.001$) but small in magnitude (OR $= 1.022$ per token), indicating that information quantity partially confounds the type effect. Critically, incompleteness remains individually significant ($p = 0.018$) after controlling for token delta, with a coefficient change of $<$8\\% relative to the model without the covariate. The slightly lower $p$-value compared to the univariate confound control in Appendix~\\ref{app:confound} ($p = 0.022$) reflects the additional variance absorbed by model covariates in the full specification.\n\n\\begin{table}[!ht]\n\\centering\n\\small\n\\caption{Logistic regression predicting violation (moderate+).

At $k = 2$, incompleteness (53.6\\%) forms a singleton cluster, with the remaining five types (31.6--42.8\\%) in the second cluster, reproducing in 34.3\\% of bootstrap samples---the most frequent partition but not overwhelmingly stable, reflecting that the 10.8\\,pp gap between incompleteness and lexical is moderate relative to within-type variance. At $k = 3$, coreferential (31.6\\%) additionally separates, consistent with the TOST equivalence structure. The AU $p$-value for the incompleteness singleton is 0.47, confirming that while the singleton is the modal partition, the boundary is not sharp.\n\n\\section{Clause-Level Variance}\n\\label{app:clause_variance}\n\nLeave-one-out analysis confirms that no single clause drives any type-level rate: maximum LOO shift is 1.4\\,pp (coreferential), and all types have LOO ranges $\\leq$2.1\\,pp. Within-type coefficients of variation (CV) range from 0.69 (incompleteness) to 1.03 (coreferential), confirming high clause-level heterogeneity. This heterogeneity is expected---clause wording determines the specific ambiguity instance---and is controlled by the matched-pair design, which compares each clause's ambiguous and unambiguous variants rather than relying on type-level means.\n\n\\section{Multiple Comparison Correction}\n\\label{app:multiple_comparison}\n\nWe apply Holm--Bonferroni correction within three test families: (i) per-type$\\times$model McNemar tests for C1 (30 tests), (ii) TOST pairwise equivalence for C2 (15 pairs), and (iii) model$\\times$type interaction for C4 (1 omnibus + post-hoc).\n\n\\section{DRIP-R Category Mapping}\n\\label{app:drip_mapping}\n\nDRIP-R's five RE ambiguity categories---attachment, coordination, anaphora, scope, and ellipsis---overlap partially with our six-type taxonomy: scopal ambiguity and coreferential ambiguity correspond directly, while our remaining four types (lexical, authorization scope, incompleteness, conditional precedence) address policy-specific phenomena outside DRIP-R's RE scope.\n\n\\section{Cross-Model Type Ranking Concordance}\n\\label{app:kendall_w}\n\nTo quantify agreement among models on the relative difficulty of ambiguity types, we compute Kendall's coefficient of concordance $W$. For the five main-study models across all six types, $W = 0.398$ ($\\chi^2(5) = 9.94$, $p = 0.072$), indicating moderate but non-significant concordance. Including the two replication models (Gemini 2.5 Flash and LLaMA 4 Scout) over five shared types (excluding coreferential, which was not included in replication), concordance reaches significance: $W = 0.353$ ($\\chi^2(4) = 9.89$, $p = 0.038$). In both analyses, incompleteness consistently ranks highest (mean rank 5.5 / 4.5), while coreferential (2.0, five-model only) and conditional precedence (2.8 / 2.1) rank lowest, supporting the graded risk structure identified in \\S\\ref{sec:results}.\n\n\\section{C4 Interaction Without Authorization Scope}\n\\label{app:c4_sans_auth}\n\nExcluding authorization scope, the residual model$\\times$type interaction vanishes ($\\chi^2(16) = 7.13$, $p = 0.97$; logistic regression LR test: $\\chi^2(16) = 9.22$, $p = 0.90$), confirming that the C4 interaction is driven entirely by authorization scope---the type most plausibly targeted by differential safety training.\n\n\\section{Per-Type Clause Length Analysis}\n\\label{app:clause_length}\n\nUnambiguous clauses are systematically longer than their ambiguous counterparts across all types (Table~\\ref{tab:token_delta}), reflecting the additional specification needed for disambiguation. Authorization scope ($+36.1$ words) and incompleteness ($+34.6$ words) show the largest deltas, consistent with the observation that resolving these types requires substantial additional content. Notably, authorization scope has the largest delta ($+36.1$) yet lower violation rates than incompleteness ($+34.6$ delta), providing counter-evidence against a pure information-quantity explanation of incompleteness's upper-bound status. The confound analysis in Appendix~\\ref{app:confound} controls for this length asymmetry.\n\n\\begin{table}[h]\n\\centering\n\\small\n\\resizebox{\\columnwidth}{!}{%\n\\begin{tabular}{lrrr}\n\\toprule\nType & Amb.\\ (mean $\\pm$ SD) & Unamb.\\ (mean $\\pm$ SD) & $\\Delta$ \\\\\n\\midrule\nauth\\_scope & $19.0 \\pm 3.3$ & $55.0 \\pm 8.1$ & $+36.1$ \\\\\nincompleteness & $12.2 \\pm 2.4$ & $46.8 \\pm 9.1$ & $+34.6$ \\\\\nlexical & $11.4 \\pm 2.3$ & $37.0 \\pm 5.8$ & $+25.7$ \\\\\nscopal & $15.7 \\pm 3.0$ & $33.5 \\pm 8.5$ & $+17.8$ \\\\\ncond\\_prec & $41.1 \\pm 7.0$ & $58.6 \\pm 8.6$ & $+17.5$ \\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}}\n\\caption{Per-type clause length (words).

This is driven by authorization scope's rank reversal (rank 1 in GPT-4.1-judged group vs.\\ rank 6 in GPT-5.4-judged group), which reflects agent composition: the GPT-4.1-judged group contains the two agents most vulnerable to authorization scope (DeepSeek 60\\%, GPT-5.4 64\\%), while the GPT-5.4-judged group contains the least vulnerable (Claude 12\\%). Incompleteness ranks 1--2 in both groups, supporting its stability independent of judge identity. This finding further motivates treating authorization scope results with caution (\\S\\ref{sec:limitations}). Excluding authorization scope---the type with lowest inter-judge agreement ($\\kappa = 0.385$) and highest cross-model variance (52\\,pp range)---the remaining five types show strong cross-group rank correlation (Spearman $\\rho = 0.90$, $p = 0.037$), confirming that the near-zero full correlation is driven entirely by authorization scope's model composition effect rather than systematic judge-group bias.\n\n\\section{Binary Effect Excluding Incompleteness}\n\\label{app:sans_incompleteness}\n\nExcluding incompleteness---the highest-violation type---the pooled ambiguous violation rate remains significantly elevated (38.4\\% vs.\\ 7.5\\% unambiguous; $\\Delta = 31.0$\\,pp, OR $= 7.75$, $\\chi^2 = 338.8$, $p < 10^{-75}$). The binary ambiguity effect (C1) is therefore not driven by incompleteness alone.\n",

Now I have all the information I need. Let me note the findings:

1. **Stengel-Eskin et al. (TACL 2024)** — The actual paper is by **Kamath, Schuster, Vajjala, and Reddy**, not Stengel-Eskin. Title: "Scope Ambiguities in Large Language Models", TACL, Volume 12, pages 738-754, 2024. DOI: 10.1162/tacl_a_00670. I'll use this paper and note the discrepancy to the user.


2. **"To Know or Not To Know" (2024)** — Sedova, Litschko, Frassinelli, Roth, and Plank published this in the Findings of EMNLP 2024, examining how LLMs handle self-consistency when faced with ambiguous inputs.
3. **Hu et al. (ACL 2023)** — Jennifer Hu and colleagues compared pragmatic language understanding between humans and language models, published at ACL 2023.
4. **Ruis et al. (NeurIPS 2023)** — Laura Ruis and team investigated how fine-tuning strategies affect LLMs' ability to resolve implicatures, appearing in NeurIPS 2023.

Now I'm thinking about where these papers fit into the related work section. The scopal ambiguity discussion seems to be scattered—there's mention of lexical types and an NLP taxonomy for different ambiguity types, but I need to identify where exactly the scope ambiguity paper would integrate best with the existing structure.

Looking at the first paragraph on ambiguity, it covers word sense disambiguation and lexical ambiguity at the token level. The Kamath et al. paper on scope ambiguity would fit naturally there as another type of ambiguity that NLP addresses, perhaps right after the discussion of lexical ambiguity to show the range of ambiguity phenomena the field tackles. I'm trying to find the most natural spot to insert the Kamath citation about scope ambiguity without disrupting the flow. The user wants minimal intrusion, just adding citations at the end of relevant sentences. Looking at the structure, the taxonomy sentence seems like the best anchor point—I can add a brief note about how LLMs handle scope-ambiguous sentences right after mentioning the linguistic-layer types, keeping it concise and integrated. I need to place the Sedova citation near the disambiguation neglect discussion in the second paragraph, probably after the Liu reference or right after the "Disambiguation Neglect" sentence itself. For pragmatic understanding, it's not explicitly covered in the current related work section, but the psycholinguistics paragraph and papers by Hu et al. and Ruis et al. on pragmatic implicature would be the natural home for that discussion.

My plan is to add the Kamath scope ambiguity citation in the first paragraph after the taxonomy sentence, then integrate Sedova into the second paragraph alongside the disambiguation neglect discussion, and place the pragmatic understanding papers in the psycholinguistics paragraph where they fit with how humans and models process ambiguous input.

Writing bibliography entries... I'm compiling the bibliography entries for the related work section, finishing up the Hu et al. paper citation and adding the Ruis et al. entry on pragmatic understanding in language models.

Now I need to figure out where to insert the scopal ambiguity citation in the related work. The user wants me to add it minimally near existing discussion of the taxonomy, but there's no current section covering scopal ambiguity. I should add a brief reference after the taxonomy sentence rather than creating an entirely new paragraph.

For the disambiguation neglect paper, I can integrate that citation into the existing sentence about agents lacking meta-cognitive awareness and social recovery channels. I'm settling on a more concise phrasing that captures the connection without overextending it—adding Sedova's work right after Liu's sentence to show how self-inconsistencies under entity-type ambiguity parallel the broader pattern of collapsing multiple interpretations, then moving forward with the rest of the analysis.

For pragmatic understanding, I should weave in Hu and Ruis after the garden-path discussion, noting that models struggle with implicature and pragmatic inference at a higher level of linguistic understanding.

Now I'm working through the precise edits needed. First, I'll add the Kamath citation about scopal ambiguity to the linguistic-layer types sentence. Then I need to extend the Li garden-path citation to include the pragmatic understanding findings from Hu and Ruis, showing how models default to literal interpretations rather than deriving implicatures.

For the third edit, I'm adding Sedova's work on self-inconsistencies under entity-type ambiguity right after Liu's point about models collapsing multiple interpretations. Finally, I need to add the corresponding bibliography entries.

Before I proceed with the full edits, I should flag a couple of citation issues: the Stengel-Eskin paper I mentioned doesn't actually exist in TACL 2024—the scope ambiguity paper there is by Kamath et al. instead. I also need to correct the publication years: Hu et al. is from ACL 2023 (not 2024), and Ruis et al. is from NeurIPS 2023 (not 2024). And I should verify that Sedova et al. is indeed from Findings of EMNLP 2024 before finalizing.

281	
282	Type rankings show near-zero correlation across judge groups (Spearman $\rho = 0.09$, $p = 0.87$). This is driven by authorization scope's rank reversal (rank 1 in GPT-4.1-judged group vs.\ rank 6 in GPT-5.4-judged group), which reflects agent composition: the GPT-4.1-judged group contains the two agents most vulnerable to authorization scope (DeepSeek 60\%, GPT-5.4 64\%), while the GPT-5.4-judged group contains the least vulnerable (Claude 12\%). Incompleteness ranks 1--2 in both groups, supporting its stability independent of judge identity. This finding further motivates treating authorization scope results with caution (\S\ref{sec:limitations}). Excluding authorization scope---the type with lowest inter-judge agreement ($\kappa = 0.385$) and highest cross-model variance (52\,pp range)---the remaining five types show strong cross-group rank correlation (Spearman $\rho = 0.90$, $p = 0.037$), confirming that the near-zero full correlation is driven entirely by authorization scope's model composition effect rather than systematic judge-group bias.

Coreferential pairs are excluded from both the mitigation and replication experiments. In mitigation, their ambiguous and unambiguous variants differ only in pronoun resolution, making it impossible to craft targeted disambiguation instructions without revealing the experimental manipulation. In replication, the $\\tau^2$-bench episode design for coreferential ambiguity is tightly coupled to the original five-model configuration; extending it to new model families would require redesigning the episode templates, which falls outside the scope of this confirmatory replication.

Given a policy clause, the classifier determines (1)~whether it contains ambiguity and (2)~the specific type from a five-type subset of our taxonomy. Coreferential ambiguity is excluded because its variants are lexically identical to their unambiguous counterparts, making surface-level type detection inapplicable.\n\nWe evaluate on 500 policy clauses (250 ambiguous, 250 unambiguous) using stratified 5-fold cross-validation, with clause pairs kept in the same fold to prevent leakage. Table~\\ref{tab:detection} reports per-type results.\n\n\\begin{table}[!ht]\n\\centering\n\\small\n\\caption{Proof-of-concept detection classifier (GPT-4.1, zero-shot, 5-fold CV).

This asymmetry arises because types with overt linguistic signals (e.g., conditional structures) are readily detectable but only moderately dangerous, whereas missing information leaves no surface trace for a classifier to exploit.\n\nThe primary confusion pathway is authorization scope $\\to$ lexical (48\\% of authorization scope clauses): authorization boundary clauses frequently contain polysemous terms, causing the classifier to attribute the ambiguity to word-level rather than permission-level underspecification.\n\nThese results position automated detection as a viable first-pass screening tool (binary F1\\,=\\,0.81) but an unreliable type classifier, particularly for the highest-risk types. The classifier was evaluated on synthetic clauses derived from $\\tau^2$-bench; generalization to naturally occurring policy documents requires further validation.\n\n\\section{Replication on Additional Model Families}\n\\label{app:model_expansion}\n\nTo test cross-architecture generalization beyond the five main-study models, we replicate the core analyses on two additional model families: Gemini-2.5-Flash (Google) and LLaMA-4-Scout (Meta), each with 250 clause pairs $\\times$ 2 conditions $= 500$ episodes judged by GPT-5.4. These models represent two additional providers not in the original study. We exclude coreferential ambiguity because its disambiguation relies on benchmark-specific assertion structure rather than clause-level text changes (\\S\\ref{sec:taxonomy}), limiting cross-benchmark generalizability. Tables~\\ref{tab:expansion_overall} and~\\ref{tab:expansion_pertype} report the results.\n\n\\begin{table}[!ht]\n\\centering\n\\small\n\\caption{Replication results on two additional model families.

Gemini's effect size falls within the original five-model range (+25.7 to +39.0\\,pp). LLaMA's smaller effect and lower OR are attributable to an elevated unambiguous baseline (17.6\\% vs.\\ $<$10\\% for all other models), suggesting weaker baseline instruction following that compresses the ambiguity-specific delta. LLaMA 3.3's elevated unambiguous baseline (17.6\\% vs.\\ 7.3--12.7\\% for main-study models) likely reflects weaker baseline instruction following, suggesting that absolute violation rates are model-dependent even absent ambiguity.\n\n\\paragraph{C2 replication.} Both models' type rankings correlate positively with the original pooled ranking. LLaMA shows a strong and significant correlation ($\\rho = 0.90$, $p = 0.037$), with incompleteness as the top type and the bottom three types matching the reference order exactly. Gemini shows a moderate positive correlation ($\\rho = 0.60$, $p = 0.285$), with the top two types (lexical and incompleteness) swapped relative to the reference. Incompleteness remains $\\geq$46\\% in all seven models (range: 46--62\\%), confirming its status as a consistent vulnerability independent of architecture or provider. $^*$Significant at $\\alpha = 0.05$.\n\n\\section{Incompleteness Confound Analysis}\n\\label{app:confound}\n\nIncompleteness is structurally distinct from the other five types: its unambiguous variant necessarily adds policy content (specifying what was previously missing) rather than merely resolving an existing ambiguity. This raises a confound: the 49.2 pp effect may partly reflect the information addition rather than ambiguity resolution per se.\n\nA logistic regression controlling for per-clause information delta (token count difference between ambiguous and unambiguous variants) confirms that incompleteness remains individually significant ($p = 0.022$, coefficient change $< 8\\%$ relative to the uncontrolled model). Coreferential ambiguity, whose variants are lexically identical (information delta $= 0$), provides a confound-free lower bound: its 31.6\\% violation rate and 18.7 pp effect are entirely attributable to semantic ambiguity. Token count is a coarse proxy for information content; finer-grained semantic measures (e.g., propositional content analysis) may reveal different confound structures.\n\nPer-type token deltas between unambiguous and ambiguous variants range from 17.5 words (conditional precedence) to 36.1 words (authorization scope). Notably, authorization scope has the largest delta (36.1) yet lower violation rates than incompleteness (delta 34.6), providing counter-evidence against a pure information-quantity explanation: if token delta drove violations, authorization scope should exceed incompleteness. Coreferential pairs have zero token delta (lexically identical variants), providing a confound-free baseline.\n\nExcluding incompleteness entirely, the pooled ambiguity effect remains large and significant ($\\Delta = 31.0$\\,pp, OR $= 7.75$, $p < 10^{-75}$), confirming that C1 does not depend on any single type.\n\nExcluding incompleteness, the remaining five types show a non-significant omnibus difference ($\\chi^2$, $p = 0.079$), but pairwise contrasts with Holm--Bonferroni correction reveal a graded risk pattern: authorization scope ($p_{\\text{adj}} = 0.039$) and lexical ($p_{\\text{adj}} = 0.025$) remain significantly above coreferential, while the four remaining pairs are equivalent at the $\\pm 15$ pp margin.\n\n\\section{Per-Type Judge Reliability}\n\\label{app:per_type_agreement}\n\nTable~\\ref{tab:per_type_agreement} reports per-type human--LLM binary agreement ($\\kappa$) on the 100-episode stratified sample (200 human--LLM rating pairs: two annotators $\\times$ corresponding LLM judge). Per-type samples range from 32 to 34 episodes, yielding wide confidence intervals.\n\n\\begin{table}[!ht]\n\\centering\n\\small\n\\caption{Per-type human--LLM binary agreement (moderate-or-above threshold). CI: bootstrap 95\\% confidence interval.}\n\\label{tab:per_type_agreement}\n\\begin{tabular}{lrrl}\n\\toprule\nType & $n$ & $\\kappa$ & 95\\% CI \\\\\n\\midrule\nLexical & 32 & 0.904 & $[0.64, 1.00]$ \\\\\nCond.\\ precedence & 34 & 0.837 & $[0.53, 1.00]$ \\\\\nIncompleteness & 34 & 0.795 & $[0.56, 1.00]$ \\\\\nAuth.\\ scope & 34 & 0.644 & $[0.35, 0.91]$ \\\\\nScopal & 32 & 0.636 & $[0.00, 1.00]$ \\\\\nCoreferential & 34 & 0.479 & $[0.00, 0.84]$ \\\\\n\\midrule\nOverall (pooled) & 200 & 0.735 & $[0.62, 0.85]$ \\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\n\nDescriptively, authorization scope has the lowest human--LLM $\\kappa$ among the four substantively high-rate types (0.644), consistent with its lowest cross-judge $\\kappa$ (0.385, \\S\\ref{sec:method}). Both reflect the inherent difficulty of permission-boundary judgments rather than systematic judge failure: raw agreement is still 85.0\\%, and the 34\\,pp within-judge-group range (\\S\\ref{sec:c4}) far exceeds measurement noise. Coreferential's low $\\kappa$ (0.479) reflects the prevalence paradox---its violation base rate is 8.8\\%, compressing the $\\kappa$ denominator despite 85.0\\% raw agreement. Per-type estimates are imprecise due to small cell sizes ($n = 32$--$34$); they are descriptive statistics only and should not be used for type-level reliability ranking or inference.\n\n\\section{Information Delta Logistic Regression}\n\\label{app:regression}\n\nTable~\\ref{tab:logistic_regression} reports the full logistic regression controlling for token-count difference between ambiguous and unambiguous variants (information delta). The reference category is authorization scope (type) and Claude Sonnet 4.6 (model). Token delta is significant ($p < 0.001$) but small in magnitude (OR $= 1.022$ per token), indicating that information quantity partially confounds the type effect. Critically, incompleteness remains individually significant ($p = 0.018$) after controlling for token delta, with a coefficient change of $<$8\\% relative to the model without the covariate. The slightly lower $p$-value compared to the univariate confound control in Appendix~\\ref{app:confound} ($p = 0.022$) reflects the additional variance absorbed by model covariates in the full specification.\n\n\\begin{table}[!ht]\n\\centering\n\\small\n\\caption{Logistic regression predicting violation (moderate+).

At $k = 2$, incompleteness (53.6\\%) forms a singleton cluster, with the remaining five types (31.6--42.8\\%) in the second cluster, reproducing in 34.3\\% of bootstrap samples---the most frequent partition but not overwhelmingly stable, reflecting that the 10.8\\,pp gap between incompleteness and lexical is moderate relative to within-type variance. At $k = 3$, coreferential (31.6\\%) additionally separates, consistent with the TOST equivalence structure. The AU $p$-value for the incompleteness singleton is 0.47, confirming that while the singleton is the modal partition, the boundary is not sharp.\n\n\\section{Clause-Level Variance}\n\\label{app:clause_variance}\n\nLeave-one-out analysis confirms that no single clause drives any type-level rate: maximum LOO shift is 1.4\\,pp (coreferential), and all types have LOO ranges $\\leq$2.1\\,pp. Within-type coefficients of variation (CV) range from 0.69 (incompleteness) to 1.03 (coreferential), confirming high clause-level heterogeneity. This heterogeneity is expected---clause wording determines the specific ambiguity instance---and is controlled by the matched-pair design, which compares each clause's ambiguous and unambiguous variants rather than relying on type-level means.\n\n\\section{Multiple Comparison Correction}\n\\label{app:multiple_comparison}\n\nWe apply Holm--Bonferroni correction within three test families: (i) per-type$\\times$model McNemar tests for C1 (30 tests), (ii) TOST pairwise equivalence for C2 (15 pairs), and (iii) model$\\times$type interaction for C4 (1 omnibus + post-hoc).\n\n\\section{DRIP-R Category Mapping}\n\\label{app:drip_mapping}\n\nDRIP-R's five RE ambiguity categories---attachment, coordination, anaphora, scope, and ellipsis---overlap partially with our six-type taxonomy: scopal ambiguity and coreferential ambiguity correspond directly, while our remaining four types (lexical, authorization scope, incompleteness, conditional precedence) address policy-specific phenomena outside DRIP-R's RE scope.\n\n\\section{Cross-Model Type Ranking Concordance}\n\\label{app:kendall_w}\n\nTo quantify agreement among models on the relative difficulty of ambiguity types, we compute Kendall's coefficient of concordance $W$. For the five main-study models across all six types, $W = 0.398$ ($\\chi^2(5) = 9.94$, $p = 0.072$), indicating moderate but non-significant concordance. Including the two replication models (Gemini 2.5 Flash and LLaMA 4 Scout) over five shared types (excluding coreferential, which was not included in replication), concordance reaches significance: $W = 0.353$ ($\\chi^2(4) = 9.89$, $p = 0.038$). In both analyses, incompleteness consistently ranks highest (mean rank 5.5 / 4.5), while coreferential (2.0, five-model only) and conditional precedence (2.8 / 2.1) rank lowest, supporting the graded risk structure identified in \\S\\ref{sec:results}.\n\n\\section{C4 Interaction Without Authorization Scope}\n\\label{app:c4_sans_auth}\n\nExcluding authorization scope, the residual model$\\times$type interaction vanishes ($\\chi^2(16) = 7.13$, $p = 0.97$; logistic regression LR test: $\\chi^2(16) = 9.22$, $p = 0.90$), confirming that the C4 interaction is driven entirely by authorization scope---the type most plausibly targeted by differential safety training.\n\n\\section{Per-Type Clause Length Analysis}\n\\label{app:clause_length}\n\nUnambiguous clauses are systematically longer than their ambiguous counterparts across all types (Table~\\ref{tab:token_delta}), reflecting the additional specification needed for disambiguation. Authorization scope ($+36.1$ words) and incompleteness ($+34.6$ words) show the largest deltas, consistent with the observation that resolving these types requires substantial additional content. Notably, authorization scope has the largest delta ($+36.1$) yet lower violation rates than incompleteness ($+34.6$ delta), providing counter-evidence against a pure information-quantity explanation of incompleteness's upper-bound status. The confound analysis in Appendix~\\ref{app:confound} controls for this length asymmetry.\n\n\\begin{table}[h]\n\\centering\n\\small\n\\resizebox{\\columnwidth}{!}{%\n\\begin{tabular}{lrrr}\n\\toprule\nType & Amb.\\ (mean $\\pm$ SD) & Unamb.\\ (mean $\\pm$ SD) & $\\Delta$ \\\\\n\\midrule\nauth\\_scope & $19.0 \\pm 3.3$ & $55.0 \\pm 8.1$ & $+36.1$ \\\\\nincompleteness & $12.2 \\pm 2.4$ & $46.8 \\pm 9.1$ & $+34.6$ \\\\\nlexical & $11.4 \\pm 2.3$ & $37.0 \\pm 5.8$ & $+25.7$ \\\\\nscopal & $15.7 \\pm 3.0$ & $33.5 \\pm 8.5$ & $+17.8$ \\\\\ncond\\_prec & $41.1 \\pm 7.0$ & $58.6 \\pm 8.6$ & $+17.5$ \\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}}\n\\caption{Per-type clause length (words). Coreferential excluded (identical surface forms).}\n\\label{tab:token_delta}\n\\end{table}\n\n\\section{Within-Judge-Group Type Rankings}\n\\label{app:judge_group_ranking}\n\nType rankings show near-zero correlation across judge groups (Spearman $\\rho = 0.09$, $p = 0.87$). This is driven by authorization scope's rank reversal (rank 1 in GPT-4.1-judged group vs.\\ rank 6 in GPT-5.4-judged group), which reflects agent composition: the GPT-4.1-judged group contains the two agents most vulnerable to authorization scope (DeepSeek 60\\%, GPT-5.4 64\\%), while the GPT-5.4-judged group contains the least vulnerable (Claude 12\\%). Incompleteness ranks 1--2 in both groups, supporting its stability independent of judge identity. This finding further motivates treating authorization scope results with caution (\\S\\ref{sec:limitations}). Excluding authorization scope---the type with lowest inter-judge agreement ($\\kappa = 0.385$) and highest cross-model variance (52\\,pp range)---the remaining five types show strong cross-group rank correlation (Spearman $\\rho = 0.90$, $p = 0.037$), confirming that the near-zero full correlation is driven entirely by authorization scope's model composition effect rather than systematic judge-group bias.\n\n\\section{Binary Effect Excluding Incompleteness}\n\\label{app:sans_incompleteness}\n\nExcluding incompleteness---the highest-violation type---the pooled ambiguous violation rate remains significantly elevated (38.4\\% vs.\\ 7.5\\% unambiguous; $\\Delta = 31.0$\\,pp, OR $= 7.75$, $\\chi^2 = 338.8$, $p < 10^{-75}$). The binary ambiguity effect (C1) is therefore not driven by incompleteness alone.\n",

1	\section{Related Work}
2	\label{sec:related_work}
3	
4	\paragraph{Ambiguity in NLP and requirements engineering.}
5	Ambiguity has been studied extensively in both computational linguistics and software engineering. Word sense disambiguation \citep{navigli_wsd_2009} addresses lexical ambiguity at the token level; our lexical type extends this to policy-specific polysemy. \citet{li_ambiguity_taxonomy_2024} propose an 11-type NLP taxonomy covering syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic ambiguity, from which we draw our linguistic-layer types. \citet{kamath_scope_2024} investigate scopal ambiguity in LLMs, finding systematic preferences for surface scope. In requirements engineering (RE), \citet{massey_ambiguity_re_2014} classify six ambiguity types in regulatory texts, and \citet{berry_kamsties_2004} introduce the distinction between nocuous ambiguity (where stakeholders diverge on interpretation) and innocuous ambiguity (where they converge). Computational detection of nocuous ambiguity has progressed from heuristic methods \citep{chantree_2006,willis_nocuous_2008} through NLP-based cross-domain detectors \citep{ferrari_ambiguity_2019,ferrari_defects_2018} to transformer-based approaches for anaphoric ambiguity \citep{ezzini_taphsir_2022,ezzini_anaphoric_2022}. \citet{zhao_nlp4re_2021} survey the broader NLP4RE landscape. Our work extends Berry and Kamsties' framework to LLM agents, where the absence of shared organizational context makes previously innocuous ambiguity nocuous.
6	
7	\paragraph{Psycholinguistics of ambiguity processing.}
8	\citet{ferreira_good_enough_2002} show that human comprehenders build shallow, ``good-enough'' representations rather than full parses, paralleling our observation that LLM agents adopt surface interpretations. \citet{frazier_rayner_1982} demonstrate early commitment to a single parse; \citet{li_garden_path_llm_2024} provide direct evidence that LLMs exhibit analogous garden-path effects. At the pragmatic level, \citet{hu_pragmatic_2023} and \citet{ruis_goldilocks_2023} show that LLMs struggle with implicature resolution, defaulting to literal interpretations even when pragmatic inference is required. \citet{liu_ambiguity_2023} demonstrate that language models fail to represent ambiguity, collapsing multiple interpretations into a single output; \citet{sedova_to_know_2024} show analogous self-inconsistencies under entity-type ambiguity. These findings ground our \emph{Disambiguation Neglect} result: agents process ambiguous input without meta-cognitive awareness but, unlike humans, lack social channels to recover. \citet{suri_structured_2025} show that structured uncertainty estimation improves coverage by 7--39\%, while \citet{sehwag_aspi_2026} demonstrate that clarification-seeking introduces prompt injection vulnerabilities---a tension for disambiguation channel design.
9	
10	\paragraph{Agent safety evaluation.}
11	The agent safety evaluation landscape includes benchmarks for risk awareness \citep{rjudge_2024}, tool-use safety \citep{toolemu_2024}, indirect prompt injection \citep{injecagent_2024}, safe task planning \citep{yin_safeagentbench_2025}, and policy-invisible violations \citep{phantompolicy_2026}. \citet{tamkin_evaluating_2023} evaluate how language models navigate policy-governed decisions, \citet{shieldagent_2025} extract formal safety rules from policy documents, and AgentAuditor \citep{agentauditor_2025} achieves human-level safety evaluation. Our work differs by focusing on the \emph{source specification} rather than the agent's execution: we measure how ambiguity in the policy itself causes safety violations, complementing work that assumes clean policies.
12	
13	\paragraph{Policy specification for agents.}
14	DRIP-R \citep{drip_r_2026} is the closest concurrent work: it benchmarks 400 policy-ambiguous retail scenarios across five RE ambiguity types, measuring decision quality rather than safety violations. Our work differs in three respects: (1) our matched-pair design establishes causality rather than correlating ambiguity presence with outcomes; (2) we measure safety violations rather than decision quality, enabling failure mechanism analysis; (3) our two-layer taxonomy adds linguistic-layer types, and we quantify the model$\times$type interaction. We map DRIP-R's five RE ambiguity categories to our six-type taxonomy in Appendix~\ref{app:drip_mapping}. PolicyBank \citep{policybank_2026} studies iterative policy refinement, closing 82\% of the gap to a human oracle. AgentPex \citep{agentpex_2026} detects procedural violations in agentic traces, finding that 83\% of perfect-outcome traces contain violations. MANTRA \citep{mantra_2026} synthesizes SMT-validated compliance benchmarks from procedural manuals. $\tau$-bench \citep{tau_bench_2024} and its successor $\tau^2$-bench \citep{tau2_bench_2025} provide the conversational agent evaluation platforms.

Our work extends Berry and Kamsties' framework to LLM agents, where the absence of shared organizational context makes previously innocuous ambiguity nocuous.\n\n\\paragraph{Psycholinguistics of ambiguity processing.}\n\\citet{ferreira_good_enough_2002} show that human comprehenders build shallow, ``good-enough'' representations rather than full parses, paralleling our observation that LLM agents adopt surface interpretations. \\citet{frazier_rayner_1982} demonstrate early commitment to a single parse; \\citet{li_garden_path_llm_2024} provide direct evidence that LLMs exhibit analogous garden-path effects. At the pragmatic level, \\citet{hu_pragmatic_2023} and \\citet{ruis_goldilocks_2023} show that LLMs struggle with implicature resolution, defaulting to literal interpretations even when pragmatic inference is required. \\citet{liu_ambiguity_2023} demonstrate that language models fail to represent ambiguity, collapsing multiple interpretations into a single output; \\citet{sedova_to_know_2024} show analogous self-inconsistencies under entity-type ambiguity. These findings ground our \\emph{Disambiguation Neglect} result: agents process ambiguous input without meta-cognitive awareness but, unlike humans, lack social channels to recover. \\citet{suri_structured_2025} show that structured uncertainty estimation improves coverage by 7--39\\%, while \\citet{sehwag_aspi_2026} demonstrate that clarification-seeking introduces prompt injection vulnerabilities---a tension for disambiguation channel design.\n\n\\paragraph{Agent safety evaluation.}\nThe agent safety evaluation landscape includes benchmarks for risk awareness \\citep{rjudge_2024}, tool-use safety \\citep{toolemu_2024}, indirect prompt injection \\citep{injecagent_2024}, safe task planning \\citep{yin_safeagentbench_2025}, and policy-invisible violations \\citep{phantompolicy_2026}. \\citet{tamkin_evaluating_2023} evaluate how language models navigate policy-governed decisions, \\citet{shieldagent_2025} extract formal safety rules from policy documents, and AgentAuditor \\citep{agentauditor_2025} achieves human-level safety evaluation. Our work differs by focusing on the \\emph{source specification} rather than the agent's execution: we measure how ambiguity in the policy itself causes safety violations, complementing work that assumes clean policies.\n\n\\paragraph{Policy specification for agents.}\nDRIP-R \\citep{drip_r_2026} is the closest concurrent work: it benchmarks 400 policy-ambiguous retail scenarios across five RE ambiguity types, measuring decision quality rather than safety violations. Our work differs in three respects: (1) our matched-pair design establishes causality rather than correlating ambiguity presence with outcomes; (2) we measure safety violations rather than decision quality, enabling failure mechanism analysis; (3) our two-layer taxonomy adds linguistic-layer types, and we quantify the model$\\times$type interaction. We map DRIP-R's five RE ambiguity categories to our six-type taxonomy in Appendix~\\ref{app:drip_mapping}. PolicyBank \\citep{policybank_2026} studies iterative policy refinement, closing 82\\% of the gap to a human oracle. AgentPex \\citep{agentpex_2026} detects procedural violations in agentic traces, finding that 83\\% of perfect-outcome traces contain violations. MANTRA \\citep{mantra_2026} synthesizes SMT-validated compliance benchmarks from procedural manuals. $\\tau$-bench \\citep{tau_bench_2024} and its successor $\\tau^2$-bench \\citep{tau2_bench_2025} provide the conversational agent evaluation platforms.

287	Excluding incompleteness---the highest-violation type---the pooled ambiguous violation rate remains significantly elevated (38.4\% vs.\ 7.5\% unambiguous; $\Delta = 31.0$\,pp, OR $= 7.75$, $\chi^2 = 338.8$, $p < 10^{-75}$). The binary ambiguity effect (C1) is therefore not driven by incompleteness alone.
