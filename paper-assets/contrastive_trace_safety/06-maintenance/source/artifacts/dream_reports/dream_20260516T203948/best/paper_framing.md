## Core Claims (3 条)

1. **Static hidden-state probes fail to reliably detect safety commitment in reasoning model traces** — static per-step probes (LogisticRegression, linear classifiers analogous to SafeSwitch/SIREN) achieve <50% detection coverage on the commitment detection task, despite hidden states containing strong safety-relevant signal (Fisher discriminant ratio 17-18 in full representation space).

2. **Temporal window probes saturate oracle-achievable detection coverage** — a simple temporal window LogisticRegression (W=15 steps) achieves 76.7% detection coverage, matching the label-oracle upper bound. The +30pp improvement over static probes comes from capturing "safety reasoning density decline" patterns invisible to single-step classification.

3. **Pre-textual detection of safety commitment remains unreliable despite positive mean lead time** — GRU sequence models achieve positive mean lead time (+4.7 steps) but with median 0, std 13, and only 39% (13/33) of detected traces achieving genuine early detection. The oracle's +31-step advantage (100% early detection) reveals a fundamental gap: hidden states encode current safety state well but poorly predict future safety trajectory. This establishes that reliable pre-textual detection requires architectural advances beyond current sequential models.

## Story Spine

- **Problem**: Reasoning models exhibit "self-jailbreak" — safety reasoning and harmful execution are interleaved throughout extended CoT (84% of traces contain safety labels after step 10), culminating in a "commitment point" where safety reasoning permanently ceases. Existing hidden-state jailbreak detectors (TrajGuard, SafeSwitch, SIREN) are designed for instruction-tuned models where the attack is an adversarial INPUT; they have never been evaluated on reasoning-model self-jailbreak where the attack is the model's OWN reasoning process.

- **Existing approaches & their gaps**: Hidden-state detectors achieve 95% defense rate on standard LLMs (TrajGuard) but operate at token-level granularity. Reasoning-model safety analysis (Self-Jailbreaking, HarmThoughts) characterizes the phenomenon but doesn't provide deployable detectors. Text-level CoT monitors (SafeRemind, SafeThink) are vulnerable to pathological CoT. No work bridges hidden-state detection TO reasoning-model self-jailbreak.

- **Our framing**: We provide the first systematic evaluation of hidden-state detection methods on reasoning-model safety commitment, discovering that (a) the safety signal exists but is distributed across minor principal components (PCA top-3 explains only 17% variance, Fisher drops from 17→1), making geometric methods (Mahalanobis/TrajGuard) fail; (b) temporal context is critical — temporal window LR saturates coverage (+30pp), and GRU achieves positive lead time (+4.7 steps); (c) but pre-textual detection remains unreliable (median 0, only 39% early detection vs oracle 100%), establishing a principled gap between current capabilities and the oracle ceiling.

- **Headline result template**: "On HarmThoughts reasoning traces, temporal methods achieve 76.7% detection coverage (matching oracle ceiling) and +4.7 steps mean lead time, while static probes achieve only 46.5% coverage with negative lead time — but reliable pre-textual detection remains elusive (39% early detection rate vs oracle 100%, +4.7 vs +31 steps)."

## Venue Fit Risks

- **EMNLP LLM Security track fit**: Strong — defense/detection method for reasoning model jailbreak, directly addressing "defense lags behind attack" gap noted in track CFP.
- **Method simplicity risk**: Core methods are temporal LR (coverage) and GRU (lead time) — neither is architecturally novel. Mitigate: frame as empirical study with method insight; the contribution is the systematic evaluation + discovery of what matters (temporal context, adequate model capacity, multi-layer signal aggregation).
- **Unreliable timing risk**: Claim 3 shows GRU achieves +4.7 mean lead time but median 0 and high variance. Mitigate: frame honestly as "proof of concept for timing but currently unreliable" — this motivates future work while contributing the coverage + limitation analysis now.
- **Cross-architecture coverage**: MVP only tested on r1-8b (Llama-3.1 base). Must validate on Qwen2.5-based models (r1-32b, QwQ-32B) for the "cross-architecture" story. If temporal advantage doesn't hold cross-architecture → Claim 2 weakens to single-model.

## Anticipated Reviewer Concerns

1. "Temporal window LR is trivial — where's the method novelty?" → Primary contribution is empirical study; method insight is that simplicity matches oracle ceiling. Additionally, BOCPD on probe score sequences as a change-point detection approach adds a novel method component that could achieve positive lead time.
2. "Only tested on one model family" → Cross-architecture experiments (P0) will address (4 models, 2 families, 2 scales).
3. "GRU lead time is unreliable (median 0, high variance)" → Acknowledged; mean +4.7 shows the signal exists but is hard to extract reliably. The coverage contribution (+30pp) is robust. GRU lead time is presented as proof-of-concept, not deployed solution.
4. "209 training traces is too few — results may not generalize" → Cross-model validation + bootstrap CIs + cross-validation with per-fold variance reporting.
5. "Why not use the full 16-label taxonomy for richer supervision?" → Ablation planned (P1).
6. "How does hidden-state monitoring compare to text-based detection?" → CRITICAL: Must include text-based baseline (sentence embeddings + temporal window LR on CoT text). If text achieves comparable performance, hidden-state motivation collapses. Hypothesis: hidden states capture pre-textual signal that text cannot.
7. "Commitment point definition is circular / tautological" → CP defined as last safety label + 1; probe detects sustained absence of safety reasoning. Mitigate: (a) discuss what CP corresponds to behaviorally, (b) report detection delay distribution showing probes fire at/after CP not just because of label definition, (c) cross-model consistency suggests real phenomenon not annotation artifact.
8. "Missing related work on representation engineering, PRMs, change-point detection" → Must cite: Zou et al. 2023 (RepE), Arditi et al. 2024 (refusal direction), Lightman et al. 2023 (PRMs/step-level supervision), Adams & MacKay 2007 (BOCPD), Hewitt & Liang 2019 (control tasks for probing).
9. "No false positive analysis — deployment utility unknown" → Must report FPR on safe traces (final_judgment=0.5) and precision-recall curves alongside coverage.
