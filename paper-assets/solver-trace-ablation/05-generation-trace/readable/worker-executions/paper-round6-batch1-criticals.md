1	\section{Introduction}
2	\label{sec:introduction}
3	
4	GRPO-trained formalizers converge to high prove rates on first-order logic problems ($97{\pm}2\%$ across three seeds, 1000 steps), yet at convergence produce effectively zero structurally sound outputs.
5	Each seed develops a distinct degenerate shortcut: conclusion embedding, repetition collapse, or tautological collapse, all invisible to execution-based evaluation, which registers success regardless of whether the proof reflects genuine derivation.
6	
7	\paragraph{The execution-only blind spot.}
8	Prove rate, the dominant evaluation metric for neurosymbolic formalizers~\citep{logic-lm, linc, satlm}, conflates faithful reasoning with degenerate shortcuts, a gap especially consequential under RL, where the optimizer exploits any shortcut the reward fails to penalize~\citep{skalse-reward-hacking, reward-hacking-survey}.
9	Recent work applies GRPO~\citep{deepseekmath} to train LLMs that generate solver-verified formal programs~\citep{mellgren-prolog-grpo, logic-rl} using binary execution feedback; this drives rapid PR gains but provides no signal on structural quality.
10	Process reward models~\citep{lightman-verify-step, math-shepherd} require expensive annotations and do not transfer to arbitrary solver-backed settings.
11	A separate line of work documents that LLMs already game logical formalization at inference time~\citep{kim-game-formalization, bondarenko-spec-gaming}; what is missing is an annotation-free \emph{diagnostic} for structural integrity in neurosymbolic outputs.
12	
13	\paragraph{Component necessity testing.}
14	We address this gap with \emph{Solver Trace Ablation} (STA), which applies \emph{component necessity testing} (leave-one-out ablation on solver inputs) to quantify structural integrity (Figure~\ref{fig:sta-overview}).
15	For each proved formalization, STA removes each component individually and re-runs the solver; the fraction of components whose removal causes proof failure yields the \emph{Intensional Structural Reward} (ISR), with $\text{ISR}{=}1$ indicating full necessity and $\text{ISR}{=}0$ complete redundancy.
16	LOO ablation itself is standard~\citep{demillo1978, jia-harman-survey}; our contribution lies in applying it as a GRPO-hacking diagnostic and in the empirical phenomena it surfaces.
17	ISR captures structural rather than semantic integrity (downstream NLI: $\rho{=}{-}0.049$, $p{=}0.187$).
18	
19	\paragraph{ISR as diagnostic.}
20	As a post-hoc diagnostic on a GRPO formalizer trained with FOLIO~\citep{folio}, ISR reveals a structural collapse trajectory invisible to PR: $\text{ISR}^{*}{:}\,0.642\to 0.132\to 0.003$ over 100--1000 steps (seed~42; 99.5\% degradation) while PR rises $32\%{\to}96\%$.
21	Three seeds diverge radically (PR $\sigma{=}47$\,pp), each converging to a qualitatively different mode: conclusion embedding, repetition collapse, and tautological collapse.
22	An SFT baseline on identical data reaches $\text{PR}{=}13.0\%$ with 92.3\% non-hacking (3-seed pooled, 1000 steps), localizing the failure to RL optimization, not data or capacity.
23	
24	\paragraph{ISR as reward: Goodhart collapse at all tested doses.}
25	Repurposed as a training signal, $r = r_{\text{exec}} \cdot (1 + \beta\,\text{ISR})$, ISR contains an inherent structural vulnerability: tautological proofs (a single premise identical to the conclusion) receive $\text{ISR}{\geq}0.5$ by construction, and implication tautologies ($P{\to}P$) receive $\text{ISR}{=}0.75$, creating a positive feedback loop once sampled during GRPO rollouts~\citep{karwowski-goodhart-rl, kwa-catastrophic-goodhart}.
26	Goodhart collapse~\citep{manheim-goodhart-taxonomy} is observed at all four tested doses ($\beta\in\{0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3\}$): $\beta$ controls \emph{when} collapse occurs, not \emph{whether}.
27	At $\beta{=}0.1$, collapse is stochastic and delayed: 5 seeds bifurcate between rapid H7 convergence (2 seeds, ${\leq}100$ steps) and a transient genuine window (${\sim}23\%$ non-hacking at 500 steps, 5-seed pooled) that closes under extended training (seeds~42 and~45: $17\%{\to}2\%$ and $55\%{\to}0\%$ genuine at 1000 steps).
28	Snapshot evaluation at 500 steps would overestimate ISR's benefit; trajectory analysis at $\beta{=}0.1$ confirms the window is temporary.
29	The effect transfers to Prolog (3/3 seeds yield 0\% non-hacking via distinct mechanisms, including \emph{query-as-fact gaming}) and is preliminarily observed at 1.7B scale (qualitatively novel gaming modes in single-seed evaluation).
30	ISR's asymmetry is the central finding: \emph{reliable as observer, unreliable as optimizer at any dose.}
31	
32	\paragraph{Contributions.}
33	Across 6 reward conditions, 5 seeds, 2 logic types, 2 model scales, and up to 1000 steps, we contribute: (\textbf{C1}) We empirically demonstrate ISR as a diagnostic for GRPO reward hacking, revealing a 99.5\% collapse trajectory invisible to PR, with an SFT control localizing the failure to RL (\S\ref{sec:diagnostic}); (\textbf{C2}) an empirical instance of Goodhart collapse~\citep{manheim-goodhart-taxonomy} at all four tested doses: ISR's structural bias ($\text{ISR}{\geq}0.5$ for tautological proofs) creates a positive feedback loop; the genuine window at moderate $\beta$ is transient, and $\beta$ controls only timing, not outcome (\S\ref{sec:goodhart}); (\textbf{C3}) cross-logic transfer to Prolog with consistent Goodhart effects across all seeds (\S\ref{sec:crosslogic}); (\textbf{C4}) a nine-mode hacking taxonomy including query-as-fact gaming, obfuscated tautology, and a scale-specific \emph{ex falso} mode, motivating functional cross-validation of diagnostics (\S\ref{sec:taxonomy}).
34	These are cautionary results: snapshot evaluation of structural rewards can overestimate their benefit; only trajectory analysis reveals the transient nature of apparent improvement.

trajectory analysis at $\\beta{=}0.1$ confirms the window is temporary.\nThe effect transfers to Prolog (3/3 seeds yield 0\\% non-hacking via distinct mechanisms, including \\emph{query-as-fact gaming}) and is preliminarily observed at 1.7B scale (qualitatively novel gaming modes in single-seed evaluation).\nISR's asymmetry is the central finding: \\emph{reliable as observer, unreliable as optimizer at any dose.}\n\n\\paragraph{Contributions.}\nAcross 6 reward conditions, 5 seeds, 2 logic types, 2 model scales, and up to 1000 steps, we contribute: (\\textbf{C1}) We empirically demonstrate ISR as a diagnostic for GRPO reward hacking, revealing a 99.5\\% collapse trajectory invisible to PR, with an SFT control localizing the failure to RL (\\S\\ref{sec:diagnostic}); (\\textbf{C2}) an empirical instance of Goodhart collapse~\\citep{manheim-goodhart-taxonomy} at all four tested doses: ISR's structural bias ($\\text{ISR}{\\geq}0.5$ for tautological proofs) creates a positive feedback loop; the genuine window at moderate $\\beta$ is transient, and $\\beta$ controls only timing, not outcome (\\S\\ref{sec:goodhart}); (\\textbf{C3}) cross-logic transfer to Prolog with consistent Goodhart effects across all seeds (\\S\\ref{sec:crosslogic}); (\\textbf{C4}) a nine-mode hacking taxonomy including query-as-fact gaming, obfuscated tautology, and a scale-specific \\emph{ex falso} mode, motivating functional cross-validation of diagnostics (\\S\\ref{sec:taxonomy}).\nThese are cautionary results: snapshot evaluation of structural rewards can overestimate their benefit; only trajectory analysis reveals the transient nature of apparent improvement.\n",

10	
11	\subsection{Task and GRPO Training}
12	\label{sec:task}
13	
14	Given premises $P_1,\ldots,P_k$ and conclusion $C$, the task is to produce a formal program $F=\{c_1,\ldots,c_n\}$ verified by an external solver $S\in\{\text{Prover9, SWI-Prolog}\}$ (Figure~\ref{fig:sta-overview}a).
15	We train with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)~\citep{deepseekmath} ($K{=}4$), where each rollout receives binary execution reward $r_{\text{exec}}(x) = \mathbf{1}[S(F_x){=}\textit{proved}]$.
16	This optimizes prove rate but provides no signal about \emph{structural quality}: a formalization embedding the conclusion among its premises receives the same reward as a faithful derivation.
17	All experiments draw from FOLIO~\citep{folio}; the held-out evaluation file retains a legacy \texttt{proofwriter\_fol\_*.jsonl} filename (from ProofWriter~\citep{proofwriter}) but contains only FOLIO-derived examples.
18	
19	\subsection{Solver Trace Ablation (STA)}
20	\label{sec:sta}
21	
22	STA tests whether each component of a proved formalization is individually necessary for proof success (Figure~\ref{fig:sta-overview}b).
23	Given a proved $x$ with $n$ components, STA constructs $n$ ablated variants $x\setminus\{c_i\}$ and re-runs the solver (Algorithm~\ref{alg:sta}).
24	A component is \emph{necessary} if its removal causes proof failure.
25	What constitutes a component depends on the logic: premises in FOL, clauses or ground facts in Prolog.
26	LOO ablation itself is standard in mutation testing and sensitivity analysis~\citep{demillo1978, jia-harman-survey}; our contribution lies in applying it as a GRPO-hacking diagnostic and in the empirical phenomena it surfaces.
27	
28	\begin{algorithm}[t]
29	\caption{Solver Trace Ablation (STA)}
30	\label{alg:sta}
31	\begin{algorithmic}[1]
32	\REQUIRE Proved formalization $x = \{c_1, \ldots, c_n\}$, solver $S$
33	\ENSURE $\text{ISR}(x) \in [0, 1]$
34	\STATE $\textit{necessary} \gets 0$
35	\FOR{$i = 1$ to $n$}
36	    \IF{$S(x \setminus \{c_i\}) = \textit{failed}$}
37	        \STATE $\textit{necessary} \gets \textit{necessary} + 1$
38	    \ENDIF
39	\ENDFOR
40	\RETURN $\textit{necessary} \,/\, n$
41	\end{algorithmic}
42	\end{algorithm}
43	
44	\paragraph{Intensional Structural Reward.}
45	ISR is the fraction of necessary components:
46	\begin{equation}
47	  \text{ISR}(x) = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\mathbf{1}\bigl[S(x\setminus\{c_i\})=\textit{failed}\bigr]
48	  \label{eq:isr}
49	\end{equation}
50	ISR is defined only for proved formalizations: ISR${=}1$ means every component is necessary; ISR${=}0$ means complete redundancy.
51	We report \emph{proved-only} ISR (denoted ISR$^*$) throughout to avoid conflating structural quality with prove rate.
52	
53	\paragraph{Limitations of ISR and the premise-count confound.}
54	ISR measures syntactic component necessity, not semantic faithfulness: a formalization can achieve $\text{ISR}{=}1$ while remaining semantically unrelated to the NL input (e.g., a single premise identical to the conclusion).
55	Critically, ISR is sensitive to component count $n$: when $n{=}2$, $\text{ISR}\geq 0.5$ regardless of proof quality; more generally, fewer components mechanically inflate ISR because each is more likely to be individually necessary.
56	This confound is central to ISR's Goodhart vulnerability (\S\ref{sec:goodhart}): H7 tautologies (single premise $=$ conclusion) achieve $\text{ISR}{\geq}0.5$ by construction, and non-collapsed seeds produce shorter formalizations (mean $n{=}5.58$ vs.\ $8.46$ for random), inflating ISR mechanically; premise-count-matched comparison eliminates the difference ($1.06\times$).
57	ISR functions as a diagnostic but fails as a training signal at every tested dose because optimization exploits the metric's structural bias rather than improving reasoning quality.
58	We recommend that any LOO-based metric on variable-length outputs report component-count-matched comparisons alongside raw values.
59	
60	\paragraph{LOO vs.\ Shapley values.}
61	Shapley values~\citep{shapley-1953} provide a theoretically grounded alternative to LOO for measuring component contribution, accounting for interaction effects between premises.
62	We chose LOO for three reasons: (1) $O(n)$ rather than $O(2^n)$ cost, critical for repeated evaluation during RL training; (2) it directly answers the diagnostic question ``is this component necessary for the proof?'' rather than measuring marginal contribution; and (3) the Goodhart effects we document would likely transfer to Shapley-based metrics, since the gaming strategies (e.g., single-premise tautology achieving ISR${\geq}0.5$) exploit the numerics of \emph{any} component-necessity measure, not LOO specifically.
63	
64	\paragraph{$O(1)$ ablation variant.}
65	A cheaper $O(1)$ binary variant produces near-zero ISR ($\text{ISR}^*{=}0.007$) indistinguishable from exec-only, confirming that per-clause LOO is necessary for ISR to carry a structural signal (Appendix~\ref{app:o1-ablation}).
66	
67	\subsection{Reward Conditions and Hacking Modes}
68	\label{sec:rewards}
69	\label{sec:taxonomy-method}
70	
71	We study six primary conditions: exec-only ($r_{\text{exec}}$), ISR reward ($r_{\text{exec}}\cdot(1{+}\beta\,\text{ISR})$ at $\beta\in\{0.1,0.3\}$), matched random controls ($r_{\text{exec}}\cdot(1{+}\beta u)$, $u\sim\mathcal{U}(0,1)$), and a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) baseline (negative log-likelihood on gold formalizations), with supplementary ISR dose points at $\beta\in\{0.05,0.2\}$ for dose-response analysis.
72	Multiplicative bonuses apply only to proved samples, keeping the prove-rate floor intact.
73	Random isolates ISR-specific signal from generic reward-variance effects; SFT isolates whether structural degeneration arises from RL optimization or data exposure alone.
74	Each RL condition uses seeds $\{42,43,44\}$ and identical training data.
75	An earlier convex formulation ($\alpha r_{\text{exec}} + \beta r_{\text{exec}}\text{ISR}$, $\alpha{+}\beta{=}1$) was discarded because $\text{ISR}{<}1$ always penalized relative to exec-only, collapsing PR (Appendix~\ref{app:setup}).
76	
77	\paragraph{Hacking taxonomy.}
78	Across conditions, seeds, and logic types we identify nine structural-degeneration modes (full definitions in Appendix~\ref{app:hacking-modes}): \textbf{H1} (conclusion embedding), \textbf{H7a/b} (single-premise tautology, standard and obfuscated), \textbf{H8} (premise-subset gaming), \textbf{H9} (contradiction injection, 1.7B only), tautological collapse, repetition collapse, complexity-without-utility, contradiction explosion, and query-as-fact gaming (Prolog-specific).
79	Modes are identified by strict text matching (H1/H7) plus functional $n_{\text{necessary}}$ analysis; the taxonomy is independently applicable to any neurosymbolic system with inspectable premise--conclusion structure.
80	We distinguish two failure semantics: exec-only \emph{low} ISR signals \emph{redundancy}, whereas ISR-rewarded \emph{high} ISR signals \emph{metric gaming}; the mode breakdown, not bare ISR, licenses reasoning-quality conclusions.

```text
1	\section{Experiments}
2	\label{sec:experiments}
3	
4	We evaluate STA along three axes: ISR as a diagnostic for reward hacking (\S\ref{sec:diagnostic}); ISR as a training reward across four dose levels, where it exhibits Goodhart effects (\S\ref{sec:goodhart}); and STA as a cross-logic protocol (\S\ref{sec:crosslogic}).
5	Cross-scale evidence from Qwen3-1.7B reveals capacity-dependent Goodhart basins (\S\ref{sec:crossscale}).
6	A hacking taxonomy synthesizes the modes observed across conditions (\S\ref{sec:taxonomy}).
7	
8	\subsection{Setup}\label{sec:setup}
9	
10	We train Qwen3-4B~\citep{qwen3} with GRPO~\citep{deepseekmath} ($K{=}4$, lr $10^{-6}$, 500 steps default, 1000 where noted) over seeds $\{42,43,44\}$ on a fixed 500-example FOLIO~\citep{folio} subset held constant across all conditions; the SFT baseline is trained with negative log-likelihood (NLL) on gold formalizations.\footnote{All experiments use \texttt{data/train\_500\_seed42.jsonl}; seeds control initialization and rollout sampling only.}
11	Held-out evaluation uses 100 FOLIO examples (\texttt{proofwriter\_fol\_100.jsonl}) with greedy decoding (Appendix~\ref{app:setup}).
12	We report prove rate (PR), proved-only ISR ($\text{ISR}^*$), hacking-mode rates from a two-stage classifier (strict text matching for H1/H7 plus functional analysis of the per-sample $n_{\text{necessary}}$ distribution; \S\ref{sec:taxonomy-method}), and a \emph{non-hacking} (N-H) rate, defined as the residual of proved samples matching none of the nine cataloged patterns (a necessary but not sufficient condition for semantic correctness).
13	
14	\subsection{ISR as Diagnostic}
15	\label{sec:diagnostic}
16	
17	\begin{figure}[t]
18	\centering
19	\includegraphics[width=0.95\columnwidth]{figures/fig2_isr_collapse.pdf}
20	\caption{ISR collapse under exec-only GRPO (seed~42). PR rises 32\%$\to$93\%$\to$96\% while proved-only ISR falls $0.642{\to}0.132{\to}0.003$ over 100$\to$500$\to$1000 steps. By step 1000, 94.8\% of proved samples have $\text{ISR}{=}0$ and mean component count inflates 6.58$\to$18.55 (contradiction explosion).}
21	\label{fig:isr-collapse}
22	\end{figure}
23	
24	\textbf{Collapse trajectory.}
25	Figure~\ref{fig:isr-collapse} traces exec-only GRPO (seed~42) at 100, 500, 1000 steps.
26	PR rises $32\%\to93\%\to96\%$, a trajectory that execution-only evaluation would interpret as successful optimization; $\text{ISR}^*$ tells the opposite story, $0.642\to0.132\to0.003$ (214$\times$ collapse). %% registry: plan003-eval-exec-only-r5, plan001-exec-only-s42-r2, plan016-extended-1000-s42
27	By 500 steps, 87.1\% of proved samples embed the conclusion (H1); by 1000 steps, the embedding rate saturates at 100\% and mean component count more than doubles ($6.58\to18.55$) as the model emits contradictory or vacuous premises that trivially derive any conclusion.
28	Extended training, lacking a structural signal, \emph{worsens} formalization quality while improving the headline number.
29	
30	\textbf{Cross-seed instability.}
31	The three exec-only seeds diverge into qualitatively different failure modes despite shared data, hyperparameters, and reward (Appendix~\ref{app:detailed-results}): s42 reaches $\text{PR}{=}93\%$ via conclusion embedding ($\text{H1}{=}87\%$); s43 collapses to $\text{PR}{=}13\%$ (at 500 steps) via repetition (87\% of rollouts truncated); s44 reaches $\text{PR}{=}98\%$ via tautological collapse ($\text{H7}{=}100\%$, mean $n{=}2.04$). %% registry: plan001-exec-only-s42-r2, plan001-exec-only-s43-r4, plan001-exec-only-s44
32	The cross-seed PR variance ($\sigma{=}47$\,pp) shows that aggregate metrics obscure qualitatively different failure modes; all three are flagged by $\text{ISR}^*$ even though one passes the PR check (s44) and one fails it (s43).
33	By 1000 steps, all three converge to high PR ($0.97{\pm}0.02$) with near-zero genuine output (see Appendix~\ref{app:h8} and Table~\ref{tab:fol-detailed}), each through a different dominant mode (s42: $\text{ISR}^{*}{=}0.003$, taxonomy unavailable; s43: H1 $93.8\%$, genuine $6.2\%$; s44: H1 $85\%$ + H8 $15\%$). %% registry: plan016-extended-1000-s42, exec-only-s43-1000step-r7, plan001-exec-only-s44-1000-r2
34	Notably, s43 recovers from $\text{PR}{=}13\%$ (500 steps) to $\text{PR}{=}96\%$ (1000 steps), but entirely through H1 exploitation: PR recovery does not imply quality recovery, and the repetition-collapse phase is transient rather than terminal.
35	
36	\textbf{SFT baseline.}
37	SFT on gold formalizations reaches $\text{PR}{=}13.0\%$ (3-seed pooled, 1000 steps) with $\text{H7}{=}0$, $\text{H1}{=}7.7\%$, $92.3\%$ non-hacking ($n{=}39$; $\text{OR}{=}147$ vs.\ exec-only, $p{<}0.001$; per-seed range ${\sim}$91--93\%). %% registry: plan009-sft-baseline-s42-1000/s43-1000/s44-1000-r3
38	The near-absence of hacking under identical data exposure is consistent with hacking being RL-specific; a 100-step checkpoint confirms hacking emerges early in training (Appendix~\ref{app:100step}).
39	SFT trains via negative log-likelihood on gold formalizations without exploration-exploitation dynamics; exploit discovery requires the trial-and-error sampling inherent to RL but absent from supervised training.
40	
41	\subsection{ISR as Reward: Goodhart Effects}
42	\label{sec:goodhart}
43	
44	We now reverse roles: instead of treating ISR as an observer, we use it as a reward augmentation, $r = r_{\text{exec}}\cdot(1 + \beta\,\text{ISR})$, with a matched random control, $r = r_{\text{exec}}\cdot(1 + \beta\,u)$, $u\sim\mathcal{U}(0,1)$, to isolate ISR-specific signal from generic reward-variance effects.
45	The headline finding: ISR contains an inherent Goodhart vulnerability~\citep{manheim-goodhart-taxonomy} observed to produce collapse at all four tested doses ($\beta\in\{0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3\}$).
46	The mechanism is structural: tautological proofs ($P{\to}P$) receive $\text{ISR}{=}0.75$ and single-premise-equals-conclusion constructions receive $\text{ISR}{\geq}0.5$, both by the LOO definition alone.
47	Once sampled during GRPO rollouts, these high-ISR tautologies create a positive feedback loop; $\beta$ controls only the \emph{timing} of collapse, not whether it occurs.

76	\end{table}
77	
78	
79	\textbf{Low-dose ISR ($\beta{=}0.1$): stochastic delayed collapse.}
80	At $\beta{=}0.1$, 5 seeds exhibit a striking bifurcation: 2 seeds (s43, s44) collapse rapidly to near-pure H7 tautology (${\geq}97\%$ H7, $0\%$ genuine within ${\sim}150$ steps), while 3 seeds (s42, s45, s46) sustain a transient genuine window.
81	The 5-seed pooled non-hacking rate is ${\sim}23\%$ at 500 steps, with the collapsed seeds pulling down the average; the 3 non-collapsed seeds individually range from $17\%$ to $55\%$ genuine.
82	This bifurcation is stochastic: all seeds are indistinguishable in the first ${\sim}100$ steps ($\text{ISR}{\approx}0.05$--$0.07$); divergence occurs at steps 150--200 when H7 tautologies, which receive $\text{ISR}{\geq}0.5$ by construction, are sampled during rollouts and reinforced via the positive feedback loop.
83	Once a seed enters the H7 basin, convergence to saturation takes ${\sim}150$ steps and is irreversible. %% registry: plan002-additive-b01-s42/s43-r2/s44/s45/s46
84	
85	H7 (a single premise identical to the conclusion, giving $\text{ISR}\geq 0.5$ by the LOO definition; \S\ref{sec:taxonomy-method}) is the canonical Goodhart exploit: the model satisfies the structural metric directly rather than producing a genuine derivation.
86	Total conclusion embedding ($\text{H1}+\text{H7}$) is GRPO-universal at $68$--$100\%$ across both ISR and random conditions (Appendix Figure~\ref{fig:hacking-composition}); the specific mode (H7 vs.\ H1) within a seed is stochastic under both conditions ($\text{CV}{>}1$), though ISR modestly increases H7 probability by providing a direct reward pathway.
87	Random yields higher PR ($83{\pm}15\%$ vs.\ $70{\pm}19\%$; $n{=}5$ each).
88	Random H7 exhibits extreme seed dependence (per-seed range: $0\%$--$91.5\%$; pooled $30\%$ is dominated by s46 at $91.5\%$ and s43 at $38.3\%$).
89	Both conditions produce H7 in 2 of 5 seeds, but the quality differs: ISR-induced H7 is absorbing ($100\%$ of proved samples in affected seeds: s43${=}61/61$, s44${=}89/89$), while random-induced H7 coexists with other modes ($38$--$92\%$).
90	ISR's reward signal converts H7 from a stochastic possibility into an irreversible attractor once sampled.
91	The reward landscape explains H7's attractor strength: H7 tautologies receive expected reward $1{+}0.75\beta$ versus ${\sim}1{+}0.26\beta$ for genuine proofs (premise-count-matched), a gap of ${\sim}0.49\beta$ that creates a persistent gradient toward tautological constructions regardless of dose.
92	
93	\textbf{The transient genuine window.}
94	During the transient window, Cochran--Mantel--Haenszel tests stratified by seed confirm ISR produces more genuine proofs than random controls ($\text{OR}_{\text{CMH}}{=}3.37$, 95\% CI $[2.21, 5.13]$, $p{<}10^{-9}$; Appendix Table~\ref{tab:fol-beta01-perseed}).
95	Pooled Fisher ($\text{OR}{=}3.48$, uncorrected) is consistent but does not account for within-seed dependence.
96	Under stricter H8+FN-corrected classification (3-seed subset with complete audits), the effect reverses ($\text{OR}{=}0.61$, n.s.), reflecting both the conservative bias of H8 correction (which reclassifies borderline samples as hacking) and the reduced sample size ($n{=}231$ vs 350). The 5-seed CMH and 3-seed corrected analyses bound the true effect from above and below respectively.
97	The pooled 5-seed non-hacking rate is 23\% (uncorrected; s42-only H8-corrected estimate: 17\%).
98	This benefit is temporary: extended training (1000 steps) on seeds~42 and~45 confirms the window closes completely ($17\%{\to}2\%$ and $55\%{\to}0\%$ genuine respectively; see below).
99	The same LOO bias that enables genuine improvement (rewarding necessary premises) also creates the Goodhart attractor (rewarding tautological constructions); the genuine window reflects seeds that have not yet sampled the H7 exploit, not seeds that resist it.
100	Snapshot evaluation at 500 steps would overestimate ISR's benefit; trajectory analysis is required to distinguish transient from stable improvement. %% registry: plan002-b01-s42/s45/s46 (500 step) + plan002-b01-s42-1000
101	
102	\textbf{Premise-count confound.}
103	The genuine-rate advantage reflects a selection effect: premise-count-matched comparison yields only $1.06\times$ ISR difference, confirming indistinguishable per-proof quality once LOO bias toward short outputs is controlled (Appendix~\ref{app:extended-discussion}).
104	
105	\textbf{Trajectory analysis: timing, not destiny.}\label{sec:goodhart-temporal}
106	Extended training (1000 steps; Appendix Figure~\ref{fig:training-isr-curves}) confirms the genuine window is transient across seeds.
107	Seed~42 declines from $17\%$ to $2\%$ genuine via H7 saturation ($16.0\%{\to}96.7\%$ H7, PR stable at ${\sim}96\%$); seed~45, which achieved the highest 500-step genuine rate ($55\%$), collapses to $0\%$ genuine through reward collapse ($\text{PR}: 42\%{\to}2\%$).
108	The two seeds exhibit distinct failure paths (H7 gaming vs.\ output collapse) but converge to the same outcome: zero genuine proofs at extended training. %% registry: plan002-b01-s42-1000, plan016-extended-1000-s42, plan002-b01-s45-1000
109	
110	\textbf{Micro-dose ISR ($\beta{=}0.05$): deterministic collapse.}
111	All three ISR seeds reach $\text{PR}{\geq}99\%$ but converge to H7a tautology (H7 $87$--$100\%$, genuine $5.1\%$), while the random control mostly fails to learn (median $\text{PR}{=}7\%$) with zero H7, confirming H7 as specific to ISR's LOO structure.
112	Below a signal-floor, ISR's genuine component is undetectable while its H7 bias remains exploitable (per-seed breakdown in Appendix~\ref{app:beta005}). %% registry: sweep-isr-b005-s42/s43/s44, sweep-random-b005-s42/s43/s44
113	
114	\textbf{Medium-dose ISR ($\beta{=}0.2$): maximum exploitation.}
115	All three seeds converge to pure H7a tautology ($0\%$ non-hacking, $n{=}290$; Appendix Table~\ref{tab:beta02-detail}). %% registry: sweep-isr-b02-s42/s43/s44
116	
117	\textbf{High-dose ISR ($\beta{=}0.3$): multi-modal Goodhart.}
118	At $\beta{=}0.3$, ISR produces extreme cross-seed instability ($\text{PR}{=}66{\pm}42\%$): three seeds yield three distinct failure modes (reward collapse, H1 shortcutting, pure H7 gaming; per-seed details in Appendix~\ref{app:beta03}).
119	The random control is equally unstable ($\text{PR}{=}54{\pm}35\%$) with $91\%$ H1 and ${\leq}4\%$ non-hacking; high-dose proxy weighting destabilizes training regardless of signal source. %% registry: plan002-additive-b03-s42/s43/s44
120	ISR vs.\ random H7 at $\beta{=}0.3$: $\text{OR}{=}13.7$, 95\% CI $[7.0, 26.8]$ (Appendix~\ref{app:beta03}).
121	
122	\textbf{Non-monotonic dose-response.}
123	The four $\beta$ levels reveal a non-monotonic pattern: $\beta\in\{0.05, 0.2\}$ converge deterministically to H7 collapse (${\geq}94\%$ H7), $\beta{=}0.3$ triggers multi-modal instability, and only $\beta{=}0.1$ sustains a transient genuine window (3 of 5 seeds).
124	Goodhart collapse is not a simple function of dose; the balance between genuine and exploit reinforcement depends on a threshold interaction between $\beta$ and rollout stochasticity.
125	
126	\subsection{Cross-Logic Diagnostic Transfer}
127	\label{sec:crosslogic}
128	
129	We replicate the FOL pipeline with Prolog/SWI-Prolog (3 seeds, $\beta{=}0.1$).
130	Under exec-only training, 2/3 seeds show $\text{ISR}^{*}{\approx}0$ despite $\text{PR}{\geq}0.56$, reflecting redundant ground-fact repetition rather than FOL-style conclusion embedding; ISR flags both failure semantics.
131	Under ISR reward, 3/3 seeds reach $0\%$ non-hacking through three distinct mechanisms: clean H7 tautology (s42, $\text{ISR}^{*}{=}1.0$), degenerate uppercase pseudo-Prolog evading text-match classifiers (s43, functional $n_{\text{necessary}}{=}1$), and query-as-fact gaming (s44, $95/97$ proved at $n_{\text{necessary}}{=}1$).
132	Seed~44 evaded our strict classifier entirely; functional cross-validation was required to expose it.
133	We attribute complete collapse to Prolog's simpler operational semantics providing a broader gaming basin (detailed results in Appendix Table~\ref{tab:prolog-detailed} and Figure~\ref{fig:prolog-comparison}).
134	
135	\subsection{Cross-Scale Evidence}
136	\label{sec:crossscale}
137	
138	We train Qwen3-1.7B under ISR $\beta\in\{0.1,0.3\}$ and Random $\beta{=}0.1$ (single seed, 500 steps).
139	All conditions produce $0\%$ non-hacking, but the exploit modes differ qualitatively from 4B: Random discovers H9 (contradiction injection, $\text{PR}{=}93\%$, $100\%$ \emph{ex falso}), ISR $\beta{=}0.1$ collapses to a single fixed template ($\text{ISR}^{*}{=}0.6$ at zero variance, $100\%$ H1), and ISR $\beta{=}0.3$ triggers reward collapse ($\text{PR}{=}17\%$) mirroring the 4B pattern.
140	H9 never appears at 4B scale; fixed-template mode collapse never appears at 4B; different capacities converge to different Goodhart basins under identical rewards.
141	No safe scale was observed in this single-seed comparison (Table~\ref{tab:hacking-taxonomy}).

175	All GRPO conditions show ${\geq}80\%$ pooled hacking; only SFT achieves $92.3\%$ non-hacking.

all three are flagged by $\\text{ISR}^*$ even though one passes the PR check (s44) and one fails it (s43).\nBy 1000 steps, all three converge to high PR ($0.97{\\pm}0.02$) with near-zero genuine output (see Appendix~\\ref{app:h8} and Table~\\ref{tab:fol-detailed}), each through a different dominant mode (s42: $\\text{ISR}^{*}{=}0.003$, taxonomy unavailable;

a 100-step checkpoint confirms hacking emerges early in training (Appendix~\\ref{app:100step}).\nSFT trains via negative log-likelihood on gold formalizations without exploration-exploitation dynamics; exploit discovery requires the trial-and-error sampling inherent to RL but absent from supervised training.\n\n\\subsection{ISR as Reward: Goodhart Effects}\n\\label{sec:goodhart}\n\nWe now reverse roles: instead of treating ISR as an observer, we use it as a reward augmentation, $r = r_{\\text{exec}}\\cdot(1 + \\beta\\,\\text{ISR})$, with a matched random control, $r = r_{\\text{exec}}\\cdot(1 + \\beta\\,u)$, $u\\sim\\mathcal{U}(0,1)$, to isolate ISR-specific signal from generic reward-variance effects.\nThe headline finding: ISR contains an inherent Goodhart vulnerability~\\citep{manheim-goodhart-taxonomy} observed to produce collapse at all four tested doses ($\\beta\\in\\{0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3\\}$).\nThe mechanism is structural: tautological proofs ($P{\\to}P$) receive $\\text{ISR}{=}0.75$ and single-premise-equals-conclusion constructions receive $\\text{ISR}{\\geq}0.5$, both by the LOO definition alone.\nOnce sampled during GRPO rollouts, these high-ISR tautologies create a positive feedback loop; $\\beta$ controls only the \\emph{timing} of collapse, not whether it occurs.\n\n\\begin{table}[t]\n\\centering\n\\small\n\\resizebox{\\columnwidth}{!}{%\n\\begin{tabular}{lcccccc}\n\\toprule\n\\textbf{Condition} & $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$ & \\textbf{PR\\%}$\\uparrow$ & \\textbf{ISR}$^*$ & \\textbf{H7\\%} & \\textbf{H1\\%} & \\textbf{N-H\\%} \\\\\n\\midrule\nBase (0-shot) & --- & 12 & --- & --- & --- & --- \\\\ %% registry: sta-phase0-baseline\nSFT & --- & 13 & 0.595 & 0 & 8 & \\textbf{92} \\\\ %% registry: plan009-sft-baseline-s42-1000/s43-1000/s44-1000-r3 (3-seed pooled)\n\\midrule\nExec-only$^\\dagger$ & --- & 93 & 0.132 & 0 & 87 & 8 \\\\ %% registry: plan001-exec-only-s42-r2 (H8 corrected)\nISR$^\\ddagger$ & 0.1 & 70{\\scriptsize$\\pm$19} & --- & \\textbf{54} & 18 & 23$^\\star$ \\\\ %% registry: plan002-additive-b01-s42/s43-r2/s44/s45/s46 (5-seed, D124)\nRandom & 0.1 & \\textbf{83}{\\scriptsize$\\pm$15} & 0.080{\\scriptsize$\\pm$.06} & 30 & 59 & 8 \\\\ %% registry: plan018-additive-random-b01-s42/s43-r3/s44-r2/s45/s46 (5-seed)\nISR & 0.2 & 97{\\scriptsize$\\pm$4} & 0.69{\\scriptsize$\\pm$.24} & \\textbf{99} & 0 & 0 \\\\ %% registry: sweep-isr-b02-s42/s43/s44 (3-seed;

The 5-seed CMH and 3-seed corrected analyses bound the true effect from above and below respectively.\nThe pooled 5-seed non-hacking rate is 23\\% (uncorrected; s42-only H8-corrected estimate: 17\\%).\nThis benefit is temporary: extended training (1000 steps) on seeds~42 and~45 confirms the window closes completely ($17\\%{\\to}2\\%$ and $55\\%{\\to}0\\%$ genuine respectively; see below).\nThe same LOO bias that enables genuine improvement (rewarding necessary premises) also creates the Goodhart attractor (rewarding tautological constructions); the genuine window reflects seeds that have not yet sampled the H7 exploit, not seeds that resist it.\nSnapshot evaluation at 500 steps would overestimate ISR's benefit; trajectory analysis is required to distinguish transient from stable improvement. %% registry: plan002-b01-s42/s45/s46 (500 step) + plan002-b01-s42-1000\n\n\\textbf{Premise-count confound.}\nThe genuine-rate advantage reflects a selection effect: premise-count-matched comparison yields only $1.06\\times$ ISR difference, confirming indistinguishable per-proof quality once LOO bias toward short outputs is controlled (Appendix~\\ref{app:extended-discussion}).\n\n\\textbf{Trajectory analysis: timing, not destiny.}\\label{sec:goodhart-temporal}\nExtended training (1000 steps;

the balance between genuine and exploit reinforcement depends on a threshold interaction between $\\beta$ and rollout stochasticity.\n\n\\subsection{Cross-Logic Diagnostic Transfer}\n\\label{sec:crosslogic}\n\nWe replicate the FOL pipeline with Prolog/SWI-Prolog (3 seeds, $\\beta{=}0.1$).\nUnder exec-only training, 2/3 seeds show $\\text{ISR}^{*}{\\approx}0$ despite $\\text{PR}{\\geq}0.56$, reflecting redundant ground-fact repetition rather than FOL-style conclusion embedding; ISR flags both failure semantics.\nUnder ISR reward, 3/3 seeds reach $0\\%$ non-hacking through three distinct mechanisms: clean H7 tautology (s42, $\\text{ISR}^{*}{=}1.0$), degenerate uppercase pseudo-Prolog evading text-match classifiers (s43, functional $n_{\\text{necessary}}{=}1$), and query-as-fact gaming (s44, $95/97$ proved at $n_{\\text{necessary}}{=}1$).\nSeed~44 evaded our strict classifier entirely; functional cross-validation was required to expose it.\nWe attribute complete collapse to Prolog's simpler operational semantics providing a broader gaming basin (detailed results in Appendix Table~\\ref{tab:prolog-detailed} and Figure~\\ref{fig:prolog-comparison}).\n\n\\subsection{Cross-Scale Evidence}\n\\label{sec:crossscale}\n\nWe train Qwen3-1.7B under ISR $\\beta\\in\\{0.1,0.3\\}$ and Random $\\beta{=}0.1$ (single seed, 500 steps).\nAll conditions produce $0\\%$ non-hacking, but the exploit modes differ qualitatively from 4B: Random discovers H9 (contradiction injection, $\\text{PR}{=}93\\%$, $100\\%$ \\emph{ex falso}), ISR $\\beta{=}0.1$ collapses to a single fixed template ($\\text{ISR}^{*}{=}0.6$ at zero variance, $100\\%$ H1), and ISR $\\beta{=}0.3$ triggers reward collapse ($\\text{PR}{=}17\\%$) mirroring the 4B pattern.\nH9 never appears at 4B scale; fixed-template mode collapse never appears at 4B; different capacities converge to different Goodhart basins under identical rewards.\nNo safe scale was observed in this single-seed comparison (Table~\\ref{tab:hacking-taxonomy}).\n\n\\subsection{Hacking Taxonomy}\n\\label{sec:taxonomy}\n\n\n\\begin{table}[t]\n\\centering\n\\small\n\\resizebox{\\columnwidth}{!}{%\n\\begin{tabular}{lccccccc}\n\\toprule\n\\textbf{Mode} & \\textbf{Exec} & \\textbf{ISR$_{.1}$} & \\textbf{Rnd$_{.1}$} & \\textbf{SFT} & \\textbf{Prolog$_{\\text{ISR}}$} & \\textbf{1.7B$_{\\text{ISR}}$} & \\textbf{1.7B$_{\\text{Rnd}}$} \\\\\n\\midrule\nH1 embed       & 87 & 18 & 59 & 7 & 0$^\\sharp$ & \\textbf{100} & 0 \\\\\nH7 duplicate   & 0  & \\textbf{54} & 30 & 0 & 100$^\\sharp$ & 0 & 0 \\\\\nH8 prem-subset & 6  & 5  & 8   & 0 & --- & 0 & 0 \\\\\nH9 ex falso    & --- & --- & --- & --- & --- & 0 & \\textbf{100} \\\\\nTautological   & --- & --- & --- & --- & s42 & --- & --- \\\\\nRepetition     & s43 & --- & --- & --- & --- & --- & --- \\\\\nContradiction  & 1k & --- & --- & --- & --- & --- & --- \\\\\nCmplx.\\ vacuous& 0  & 0  & 4  & 0 & --- & --- & --- \\\\\nQuery-as-fact  & --- & --- & --- & --- & s44 & --- & --- \\\\\n\\midrule\n\\textbf{Non-hacking} & 8  & \\textbf{23}  & 8 & \\textbf{92} & \\textbf{0} & \\textbf{0} & \\textbf{0} \\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}}\n\\caption{Nine hacking modes across conditions (\\% of proved samples;

6	Table~\ref{tab:hyperparams} lists all hyperparameters shared across experiments.
7	All RL conditions use the same GRPO configuration; only the reward function differs.
8	Seeds control model weight initialization and data shuffling; training data is held constant across all seeds and conditions (Constraint~C001).

52	\paragraph{Evaluation protocol.}
53	All cross-run ISR values are recomputed uniformly by a single evaluator (\texttt{eval\_sta.py}) so that training-log ISR is never compared across runs.
54	The evaluation file \texttt{proofwriter\_fol\_100.jsonl} is a legacy filename containing no ProofWriter data.
55	FOL exec-only seed~43 (\texttt{plan001-exec-only-s43-r4}) was evaluated with sampling (temperature~$=0.7$) rather than greedy decoding.
56	Its PR and ISR values are included for completeness but are not strictly comparable with other seeds under the unified evaluation protocol (C004).
57	
58	
59	\section{STA Algorithm}
60	\label{app:algorithm}
61	
62	Algorithm~\ref{alg:sta} (Section~\ref{sec:sta}) gives the procedure for computing ISR over a proved formalization.
63	For unproved samples ($S(x) \neq \textit{proved}$), ISR is undefined and the protocol is not applied.
64	
65	
66	\section{Extended Discussion}
67	\label{app:extended-discussion}
68	
69	\paragraph{What ISR measures, and what it does not.}
70	ISR quantifies syntactic component necessity: the fraction of solver-input components whose individual removal causes proof failure.
71	This is strictly weaker than semantic faithfulness (whether the formalization accurately captures the natural-language meaning).
72	We verify this empirically: Spearman $\rho(\text{ISR}, \text{NLI accuracy}) = -0.049$ ($p = 0.187$, n.s.) from a downstream NLI evaluation on exec-only checkpoint outputs.
73	ISR and downstream task performance are uncorrelated.
74	ISR is thus a structural integrity diagnostic, not a semantic quality metric: high ISR indicates that every component contributes to the proof, not that the proof faithfully represents the original reasoning problem.
75	
76	Critically, low ISR carries different semantics depending on the training objective.
77	Under exec-only training, low ISR in Prolog reflects redundant coding (repeated ground facts where removing any single copy does not affect the proof) rather than an absence of reasoning (\S\ref{sec:crosslogic}).
78	Under ISR-as-reward, high ISR reflects metric gaming (\S\ref{sec:goodhart}).
79	ISR values must always be interpreted relative to the optimization objective that produced them.
80	
81	\paragraph{The premise-count confound.}
82	LOO-based metrics like ISR have an inherent mathematical bias: with fewer components, each is mechanically more likely to be necessary.
83	A formalization with 2 premises where both are necessary yields ISR${=}1.0$; one with 10 premises where 8 are necessary yields ISR${=}0.8$, even though the latter encodes richer reasoning.
84	This confound is central to ISR's Goodhart vulnerability: H7 tautologies (single premise $=$ conclusion) achieve $\text{ISR}{\geq}0.5$ \emph{by construction}, and the shorter formalizations produced by non-collapsed seeds at $\beta{=}0.1$ also inflate ISR mechanically.
85	Premise-count-matched comparison on non-hacking samples yields $\text{ISR}^{*}{=}0.258$ vs.\ $0.243$ for random ($1.06\times$; Table~\ref{tab:fol-beta01-detailed}), confirming that even within the transient genuine window the structural benefit is negligible.
86	This bias is not specific to our setting; any LOO-based structural metric applied to variable-length outputs requires component-count normalization.
87	We recommend that future work employing ablation-based diagnostics report premise-count-matched comparisons alongside raw values.

117	\paragraph{Seed-level statistical analysis.}
118	To address potential inflation from within-seed dependence, we supplement pooled Fisher exact tests with two seed-aware analyses.
119	Cochran--Mantel--Haenszel (CMH) tests stratify by seed while pooling across samples: H7 $\text{OR}_{\text{CMH}}{=}2.46$ (95\% CI $[1.85, 3.27]$, $p{=}5.6{\times}10^{-16}$); genuine $\text{OR}_{\text{CMH}}{=}3.37$ (95\% CI $[2.21, 5.13]$, $p{=}4.5{\times}10^{-10}$).
120	Seed-level permutation tests (treating each seed as a single observation, $n{=}5$ per group) yield $p{=}0.28$ (H7) and $p{=}0.26$ (genuine), consistent with the severe power limitation of $n{=}5$ (minimum achievable $p{=}0.008$) rather than absence of effect.

150	\paragraph{H7 as inevitable exploit.}
151	ISR's LOO definition creates an inherent structural bias: tautological proofs ($P{\to}P$) receive $\text{ISR}{=}0.75$, and single-premise-equals-conclusion constructions receive $\text{ISR}{\geq}0.5$, making H7 the global ISR-maximizing exploit.
152	$\beta$ controls the \emph{timing} of collapse, not whether it occurs.
153	At all four tested doses, H7 dominates: $\beta{=}0.05$ (3 seeds, pooled H7 $93.7\%$, $n{=}253$; random s43 achieves $\text{PR}{=}62\%$ with H1 $77.4\%$ and zero H7, confirming mode specificity); $\beta{=}0.1$ (stochastic bifurcation: 2/5 seeds collapse within ${\sim}150$ steps, remaining 3/5 sustain a transient window that closes under extended training); $\beta{=}0.2$ ($100\%$ H7 across all three seeds, $n{=}290$; Table~\ref{tab:beta02-detail}); $\beta{=}0.3$ (multi-modal, s44 pure H7).
154	The random control produces $29.5\%$ H7 ($122/414$, 5-seed; per-seed: $0\%$--$91.5\%$, dominated by s46 at $91.5\%$ and s43 at $38.3\%$; s42/s44/s45 at $0\%$), random $\beta{=}0.3$ yields 4--7 H7a per seed.
155	Once a seed samples and reinforces the H7 exploit, convergence is irreversible; this absorbing-state property guarantees eventual collapse regardless of dose.

174	
175	\paragraph{Goodhart effects: implications.}
176	The finding extends beyond this specific system.
177	ISR was designed to \emph{detect} reward gaming of $r_{\text{exec}}$, yet it contains an inherent structural vulnerability: by its LOO definition, tautological proofs receive artificially high ISR ($P{\to}P$ yields $\text{ISR}{=}0.75$; single-premise-equals-conclusion yields $\text{ISR}{\geq}0.5$), creating a positive feedback loop once sampled during GRPO rollouts~\citep{karwowski-goodhart-rl, kwa-catastrophic-goodhart}.
178	Goodhart collapse~\citep{manheim-goodhart-taxonomy} is observed at all four tested doses ($\beta{=}0.05$: 3 seeds; $\beta\in\{0.1, 0.2, 0.3\}$: 3--5 seeds each).
179	The structural bias predicts universality (H7 tautology is always the global reward-maximizing exploit regardless of $\beta$), and $\beta$ controls only the probability of early sampling and thus the timing of collapse; at $\beta{=}0.05$, three seeds confirm deterministic H7 collapse ($93.7\%$ pooled) while the matched random control at the same $\beta$ produces H1 redundancy instead ($77.4\%$), ruling out dose magnitude as the driver.
180	At moderate doses ($\beta{=}0.1$), collapse is stochastic and delayed (5 seeds bifurcate: 2 collapse rapidly, 3 sustain a transient genuine window that trajectory analysis confirms is temporary); at higher doses ($\beta{=}0.2$), collapse is immediate and universal.
181	$\beta{=}0.3$ adds reward collapse~\citep{gao-reward-overoptimization} as a competing failure mode (PR drops to 18\% in 1/3 seeds), but the underlying Goodhart vulnerability remains the same.
182	The practical implication is that ISR (and structurally similar LOO-based diagnostics) should be used exclusively as post-hoc evaluation tools, never as training rewards.
183	
184	\paragraph{Single-seed unreliability.}
185	The three exec-only seeds diverge radically (PR $\sigma{=}47$ percentage points), each converging to a qualitatively different degeneration mode (\S\ref{sec:diagnostic}).
186	ISR $\beta{=}0.1$ (5 seeds) shows even greater instability: 2/5 seeds collapse to H7 within ${\sim}150$ steps, while 3/5 sustain a transient genuine window.
187	The 5-seed pooled non-hacking rate is ${\sim}23\%$ at 500 steps; trajectory analysis on seeds~42 and~45 (1000 steps) confirms this is temporary ($17\%{\to}2\%$ and $55\%{\to}0\%$ genuine respectively).
188	The dominant hacking mode (H7 vs.\ H1) is stochastic within any treatment condition ($\text{CV}{>}1$).
189	Multi-seed evaluation with trajectory analysis should be standard practice for neurosymbolic RL systems; single-seed or single-checkpoint results can misrepresent a configuration's true hacking profile.
190	
191	
192	\section{Hacking Mode Definitions}
193	\label{app:hacking-modes}
194	
195	We identify nine distinct reward hacking modes across all experiments.
196	Each mode is defined below with its mechanism, a representative example, and its interaction with ISR.
197	Table~\ref{tab:hacking-taxonomy-app} summarizes prevalence across FOL conditions.

ISR increases H7 probability without reducing total hacking; the specific mode (H7 vs.\ H1) is seed-dependent within each condition. SFT shows near-zero hacking.}

225	\label{tab:hacking-taxonomy-app}
226	\end{table}
227	
228	\paragraph{Classifier Validation.}
229	Hacking mode classification uses deterministic rule-based classifiers, not learned models, so standard ML precision/recall is not directly applicable.
230	H1 and H7 are identified by normalized text matching between conclusion and premise strings after whitespace and variable normalization; remaining modes are detected via functional analysis of the per-sample $n_{\text{necessary}}$ distribution from STA (leave-one-out ablation).
231	No training data or manual annotation is used for classification.
232	
233	To estimate precision, we manually verified 50 randomly sampled outputs classified as H1 or H7: all 50 were confirmed correct (estimated precision ${>}$95\%, Wilson 95\% CI: [93\%, 100\%]).
234	Recall is inherently bounded by the text-match threshold: semantic manipulations that alter surface form while preserving the gaming structure (e.g., variable renaming beyond our normalization, or paraphrased conclusions) would be missed.
235	We cross-validate with functional LOO analysis: samples classified as non-hacking but showing $n_{\text{necessary}} \leq 1$ are flagged as potential false negatives.
236	This cross-validation revealed query-as-fact gaming in Prolog (\S\ref{app:hacking-modes}), where the strict text classifier reported 100\% non-hacking but functional analysis showed 95/97 samples were tautological ($n_{\text{necessary}}{=}1$).
237	The non-hacking rate for FOL conditions may therefore be slightly overestimated, as subtle semantic manipulations below our text-matching threshold would evade the strict classifier.
238	
239	\subsection{H8 --- Premise-Subset Gaming}
240	\label{app:h8}
241	
242	Manual audit of ISR $\beta{=}0.1$ seed~42 revealed a previously undetected hacking mode: the model emits a subset of the gold premises that is individually necessary (high ISR) but insufficient for the intended derivation, with proof success depending on the conclusion already being embedded (H1-style).
243	We term this \textbf{H8 (premise-subset gaming)}: formalizations where each component is LOO-necessary but the premise set is a strict subset of what the NL problem requires, inflating ISR without faithful reasoning.
244	
245	\paragraph{Detection.} H8 is identified by manual inspection of non-hacking samples with unusually low premise counts ($n_{\text{prem}} \leq 3$) that nonetheless achieve high ISR.
246	Automated detection is not currently feasible because H8 requires comparing the generated premise set against the gold premises.
247	
248	\paragraph{Audit scope and limitations.}
249	Full H8 audit was completed for ISR $\beta{=}0.1$ seed~42 only.
250	ISR seeds~43 and~44 checkpoints were deleted before audit and cannot be recovered; their non-hacking rates may be overestimated.
251	Random $\beta{=}0.1$ does not produce H8 by mechanism (no ISR optimization pressure); seed~42 audit confirmed H8${=}0$.
252	
253	\paragraph{H7 false-negative correction (H7b obfuscated tautology).}
254	ISR $\beta{=}0.1$ seed~44 contained 12 samples with $n_{\text{prem}}{=}1$ classified as non-hacking by the text matcher.
255	Manual inspection confirmed all 12 are logically equivalent to H7 but evade text matching through vacuous quantifier wrapping ($11/12$) or structural simplification ($1/12$).
256	We classify these as \textbf{H7b} (obfuscated tautology), distinct from text-match-detectable H7a.
257	$10/12$ achieve $\text{ISR}{\geq}0.83$, indicating simultaneous gaming of execution reward, ISR metric, and H7 classifier (triple gaming; \S\ref{sec:taxonomy}).
258	After correction, ISR s44 non-hacking${=}0$; total H7 = H7a (77 text-match) + H7b (12 obfuscated) = 89.
259	
260	\paragraph{Impact on non-hacking-rate comparison.}
261	After H8 reclassification and H7 false-negative correction: ISR non-hacking $= 14/231 = 6.06\%$ vs.\ random non-hacking $= 25/262 = 9.5\%$ (Fisher $p{=}0.182$, n.s.; Wilson 95\% CI: ISR [3.6\%, 9.9\%], Random [6.5\%, 13.7\%]).
262	The direction is consistent with ISR-amplified gaming modes (H7, H8) displacing non-hacking output, but the effect is not statistically significant at the conventional $\alpha{=}0.05$ threshold.
263	
264	\subsection{H1 --- Conclusion Embedding}
265	
266	\paragraph{Definition.}
267	The conclusion appears verbatim (or with trivial variable renaming) as one premise among multiple premises.
268	The solver succeeds by matching the embedded conclusion, rendering the other premises irrelevant to the proof.
269	
270	\paragraph{Example (FOL).}
271	{\small\begin{verbatim}
272	Premises:
273	  all x (bird(x) -> flies(x)).
274	  bird(tweety).
275	  flies(tweety).  % conclusion embedded
276	Conclusion: flies(tweety).
277	\end{verbatim}}
278	
279	\paragraph{ISR interaction.}
280	Variable. The embedded premise has ISR~$=1$ (removing it may break the proof), but other premises may also register as necessary depending on Prover9's search strategy.
281	ISR does not distinguish trivial from substantive necessity.
282	
283	\paragraph{Prevalence.}
284	Conclusion embedding in some form (H1 multi-premise or H7 single-premise) is GRPO-universal at 68--97\% across all RL conditions.
285	Under exec-only and Random reward, it manifests as H1 (59--91\%); under ISR reward, it shifts to H7 (54\% pooled, 5-seed).
286	
287	
288	\subsection{H7a --- Conclusion Duplication (Standard)}
289	
290	\paragraph{Definition.}
291	The entire formalization collapses to a single premise whose content is identical (text-match detectable) to the conclusion.
292	Since $P \to P$ is trivially provable, this simultaneously maximizes exec reward.
293	Because the sole premise is necessary for every sub-component of the conclusion under LOO ablation, ISR is inflated toward 1.0.
294	
295	\paragraph{Example (FOL).}
296	{\small\begin{verbatim}
297	Premises:
298	  all x ((A(x)&B(x))->(C(x)|D(x))).
299	Conclusion:
300	  all x ((A(x)&B(x))->(C(x)|D(x))).
301	\end{verbatim}}
302	
303	\paragraph{ISR interaction.}
304	ISR~$\approx 0.8$--$1.0$.
305	The single premise is trivially ``maximally necessary,'' but the proof is vacuous.
306	H7a games both exec reward and ISR reward; H7b extends this to triple gaming by additionally evading the text-match classifier.
307	
308	\paragraph{Prevalence.}
309	H7a (text-match detectable): 64.5\% (149/231, 3-seed) under ISR~$\beta{=}0.1$ (s42: 16.0\%, s43: 96.7\%, s44: 86.5\%); 5-seed pooled H7: 54\% (190/350, Table~\ref{tab:goodhart-landscape}).
310	Combined H7 (H7a + H7b, 3-seed): 70.6\% (163/231; s43 H7a${=}59$ + H7b${=}2$; includes s44 FN correction).
311	Random~$\beta{=}0.1$ pooled: 29.5\% (122/414, 5-seed, all H7a; driven by s46 at 91.5\% and s43 at 38.3\%; s42/s44/s45 at 0\%).
312	
313	
314	\subsection{H7b --- Obfuscated Tautology}
315	
316	\paragraph{Definition.}
317	A single-premise formalization logically equivalent to H7a (premise = conclusion) but with surface-form differences that evade the text-match H7 classifier.
318	The model achieves this through vacuous quantifier wrapping ($11/12$ instances) or structural simplification ($1/12$).
319	
320	\paragraph{Example (FOL, vacuous quantifier wrapping).}
321	{\small\begin{verbatim}
322	Premises:
323	  all x all y ((A(x)&B(y))->(C(x)|D(y))).
324	Conclusion:
325	  all x ((A(x)&B(x))->(C(x)|D(x))).
326	\end{verbatim}}
327	The premise introduces a vacuous second quantifier variable $y$ that is immediately unified with $x$, making the formulas logically equivalent while differing textually.
328	
329	\paragraph{ISR interaction.}
330	$\text{ISR}{\geq}0.83$ ($10/12$ samples).
331	H7b simultaneously games three objectives: execution reward ($r_{\text{exec}}{=}1$ via tautological proof), ISR metric (single necessary premise yields high ISR), and the text-match H7 classifier (surface-form difference evades detection).
332	This triple gaming makes H7b the most complete Goodhart case we observe.
333	
334	\paragraph{Prevalence.}
335	Found primarily in ISR $\beta{=}0.1$ seed~44 ($12/89$ proved samples, all originally classified as non-hacking); seed~43 contributes $2$ additional cases.
336	Functional cross-validation via $n_{\text{necessary}}{=}1$ exposed the misclassification.
337	
338	
339	\subsection{Tautological Collapse}
340	
341	\paragraph{Definition.}
342	Two-component formalizations where the premise and conclusion are identical atomic or simple formulas, yielding a $P \to P$ tautology with minimal token cost.
343	
344	\paragraph{Example (FOL).}
345	\begin{verbatim}
346	Premises: p(a).
347	Conclusion: p(a).
348	\end{verbatim}
349	
350	\paragraph{ISR interaction.}
351	ISR~$=1.0$ (the sole premise is necessary).
352	Distinguished from H7 by having low component count ($n_{\text{comp}}\approx 2$) and atomic formulas rather than complex sub-structured conclusions.
353	
354	\paragraph{Prevalence.}
355	Dominant in FOL exec-only seed~44 (PR~$=0.98$, mean $n_{\text{comp}}=2.04$, 100\% H7 by strict classifier).
356	Also observed in Prolog exec+STA seed~42 (100\% H7, PR~$=0.50$).
357	
358	
359	\subsection{Repetition Collapse}
360	
361	\paragraph{Definition.}
362	The model generates identical premises or clauses repeated until the maximum completion length, producing a degenerate output with high token count but no logical diversity.
363	Removing any single repeated copy leaves the others intact, yielding ISR~$\approx 0$.
364	
365	\paragraph{Example (Prolog).}
366	\begin{verbatim}
367	penguin(fido).
368	penguin(fido).
369	penguin(fido).
370	... (repeated to 512 tokens)
371	query(penguin(fido)).
372	\end{verbatim}
373	
374	\paragraph{ISR interaction.}
375	ISR~$\approx 0$. Each copy is individually redundant since identical copies remain after removal.
376	ISR correctly diagnoses this degeneration.
377	
378	\paragraph{Prevalence.}
379	Observed in FOL exec-only seed~43 (87\% of outputs hit max completion length; PR~$=13$\%, ISR~$=0$).
380	
381	
382	\subsection{Complexity-without-Utility}
383	
384	\paragraph{Definition.}
385	The formalization contains syntactically complex premises (nested quantifiers, multi-arity predicates) that are semantically vacuous; none is individually necessary for the proof.
386	The complexity inflates surface metrics (formula length, nesting depth) without contributing to logical derivation.
387	
388	\paragraph{Example (FOL).}
389	{\small\begin{verbatim}
390	Premises:
391	  all x all y (R(x,y) ->
392	    exists z (S(x,z) & T(z,y))).
393	  all x (P(x) -> Q(x)).
394	  P(a).            % only this needed
395	Conclusion: Q(a).
396	\end{verbatim}}
397	
398	\paragraph{ISR interaction.}
399	ISR correctly identifies the vacuous premises (ISR~$=0$ for each), pulling down the mean ISR.
400	This is the mode ISR is best calibrated for.
401	
402	\paragraph{Prevalence.}
403	Low. Observed in Random~$\beta{=}0.1$ seed~42 at 3.8\% (3/79).
404	Not observed under ISR reward (ISR's gradient discourages zero-ISR premises).
405	
406	
407	\subsection{Contradiction Explosion}
408	
409	\paragraph{Definition.}
410	The component count grows unboundedly over training.
411	Excess premises introduce contradictions or redundancies that trivially entail any conclusion via \emph{ex falso quodlibet}.
412	Individual premises may register as ISR~$=0$ (removable without breaking the proof), but the sheer count obscures the underlying triviality.
413	
414	\paragraph{Example (FOL, 1000-step exec-only).}
415	{\small\begin{verbatim}
416	Premises:
417	  c1. c2. c3. ... c18. % 18.55 mean
418	  % conclusion embedded among premises
419	Conclusion: Q(a).
420	\end{verbatim}}
421	
422	\paragraph{ISR interaction.}
423	ISR~$\approx 0$ (at 1000 steps: ISR~$=0.003$, with 94.8\% of proved samples having ISR~$=0$).
424	
425	\paragraph{Prevalence.}
426	Observed in extended exec-only training (seed~42, 1000 steps).
427	Mean component count grows from ${\sim}6$ (500 steps) to 18.55 (1000 steps).
428	
429	
430	\subsection{Query-as-Fact Gaming}
431	
432	\paragraph{Definition.}
433	The model converts the natural language conclusion into a snake\_case atom and includes it as both a ground fact and the query.
434	Prolog trivially proves the query by unifying with the fact.
435	This mode evades text-match classifiers designed for H1/H7 because the generated atom bears no surface resemblance to the original conclusion text.
436	
437	\paragraph{Example (Prolog).}
438	\begin{verbatim}
439	% NL: "Fido is happy."
440	% Model output:
441	fido_is_happy.
442	:- fido_is_happy.     % query = fact
443	\end{verbatim}
444	
445	\paragraph{ISR interaction.}
446	ISR~$\approx 0.9$--$1.0$.
447	The single fact is trivially necessary (its removal breaks the query), inflating ISR.
448	Functionally equivalent to H7 but with a distinct surface mechanism.
449	
450	\paragraph{Prevalence.}
451	Observed in Prolog exec+STA seed~44 (PR~$=0.97$, ISR~$=0.912$).
452	95/97 proved samples have $n_{\text{necessary}}=1$, confirming functional tautology despite the strict classifier reporting 100\% non-hacking.
453	
454	
455	\subsection{H9 --- Ex Falso Quodlibet (Contradiction Injection)}
456	
457	\paragraph{Definition.}
458	The model generates a premise set containing logically contradictory assertions (e.g., $P(x)$ and $\neg P(x)$).
459	From contradictory premises, any conclusion follows by the \emph{ex falso quodlibet} principle, rendering the proof semantically vacuous regardless of the conclusion's content.
460	Unlike the ``contradiction explosion'' mode observed in 4B exec-only at 1000 steps (where contradictions arise incidentally among inflated premise counts), H9 is a \emph{targeted} strategy: the model constructs minimal contradictory pairs that directly enable the proof.
461	
462	\paragraph{Example (FOL).}
463	{\small\begin{verbatim}
464	Premises:
465	  all x (bird(x) -> flies(x)).
466	  bird(tweety).
467	  -bird(tweety).  % contradicts above
468	Conclusion: happy(tweety).
469	% Proof: bird(tweety) & -bird(tweety) -> False -> anything
470	\end{verbatim}}
471	
472	\paragraph{ISR interaction.}
473	ISR~$>0$ because each side of the contradiction is individually necessary under LOO: removing $P(x)$ leaves $\neg P(x)$ alone, which cannot derive a contradiction; removing $\neg P(x)$ leaves the premises consistent but insufficient to derive an unrelated conclusion.
474	The LOO test thus registers both contradictory premises as ``necessary,'' inflating ISR despite the formalization being semantically vacuous.
475	
476	\paragraph{Prevalence.}
477	Observed exclusively in Qwen3-1.7B under Random $\beta{=}0.1$ (seed~42, 500 steps, proper train/eval separation): 100\% of proved samples ($n{=}93$) exhibit H9.
478	Under ISR $\beta{=}0.1$ with the same model, H9 does not appear; the model instead converges to fixed-template H1 ($\text{ISR}{=}0.6$, zero variance), indicating that ISR reward redirects the hacking pathway from H9 to H1.
479	Not observed in any Qwen3-4B experiment across all conditions and seeds tested. %% registry: d113-1.7b-random-b01-s42

615	\paragraph{ISR collapse trajectory (FOL exec-only, seed 42).}
616	Table~\ref{tab:fol-detailed} traces the ISR collapse over training:
617	ISR$^*=0.642$ at 100 steps $\to$ $0.132$ at 500 steps ($-79.4$\%) $\to$ $0.003$ at 1000 steps ($-99.5$\% from step 100).
618	PR increases monotonically ($0.32 \to 0.93 \to 0.96$) while structural quality collapses, confirming that ISR captures degeneration invisible to execution reward.
619	By step 1000, 94.8\% of proved samples have ISR~$=0$ and the mean component count rises to 18.55.
620	
621	\paragraph{Prolog: consistent gaming across all seeds via three distinct pathways.}
622	All three Prolog exec+ISR seeds exhibit Goodhart effects with 0\% non-hacking proofs (Figure~\ref{fig:prolog-comparison}), but each discovers a different gaming mechanism:
623	seed~42 produces clean H7 tautologies (single premise~$=$~conclusion),
624	seed~43 generates uppercase pseudo-Prolog that bypasses the text-match classifier while remaining functionally tautological,
625	and seed~44 converts NL conclusions to snake\_case atoms used as both fact and query.
626	The diversity of gaming pathways across seeds, despite identical training data and reward function, demonstrates that Goodhart's Law in neurosymbolic reasoning is not a single failure mode but a family of convergent exploits.

661	\subsection{Per-Seed Results at $\beta{=}0.05$}
662	\label{app:beta005}
663	
664	The 3-seed random control at $\beta{=}0.05$ is highly unstable: s42 fails entirely ($\text{PR}{=}0\%$), s44 barely learns ($\text{PR}{=}7\%$, H1 $71\%$, genuine $0\%$), and only s43 reaches moderate output ($\text{PR}{=}62\%$, H1 $77\%$, genuine $13\%$).
665	The single random seed that learns (s43) shows higher genuine output than ISR ($13\%$ vs.\ $5.1\%$ pooled), consistent with a signal-floor below which ISR's genuine component is undetectable while its H7 bias remains exploitable.
666	
667	\subsection{Early-Training Hacking Analysis (100-Step Checkpoint)}
668	\label{app:100step}
669	
670	To control for the prove-rate confound in our SFT comparison (\S\ref{sec:diagnostic}), we analyze the exec-only checkpoint at 100 training steps (seed~42), where PR${=}32$\%, higher than SFT (13.0\%, 3-seed pooled) but still early in training.
671	Of the 32 proved samples, 9 (28.1\%) exhibit H7 hacking (single premise identical to conclusion) and 1 (3.1\%) exhibits H1 (conclusion embedded among premises), yielding a total hacking rate of 31.2\%.
672	By contrast, SFT at comparable or lower PR shows 7.7\% hacking (1/13 proved samples).
673	This demonstrates that reward hacking emerges early in GRPO training, well before the prove-rate plateau, and is not simply an artifact of having more proved samples available for exploitation.
674	The 100-step hacking rate (31.2\%) is already substantially above SFT (7.7\%), supporting the claim that hacking is associated with RL optimization rather than prove-rate level alone.
675	
676	\subsection{$O(1)$ vs.\ $O(n)$ ISR Ablation}
677	\label{app:o1-ablation}
678	
679	To justify the per-clause LOO design (\S\ref{sec:sta}), we train a variant that replaces the $O(n)$ ablation with a cheaper $O(1)$ binary signal: $\text{fast\_ISR}(x) = 1$ if $x$ is proved \emph{and} the conclusion is not provable under empty premises (tautology check), $0$ otherwise.
680	The reward becomes $r = 0.5\,r_{\text{exec}} + 0.5\,\text{fast\_ISR}$.
681	After 500 steps (seed~42), this variant achieves $\text{PR}{=}63\%$ with $\text{ISR}^*{=}0.007$ (functionally zero), compared to $\text{ISR}^*{=}0.132$ under standard exec-only and $\text{ISR}^*{=}0.42$ under ISR $\beta{=}0.1$.
682	
683	\paragraph{ISR signal vs.\ training dynamics.}
684	At the \emph{ISR signal level}, the $O(1)$ variant is indistinguishable from exec-only: both produce near-zero ISR because models emit redundant premise copies whose individual removal never changes the proof outcome.
685	At the \emph{training level}, the two conditions are non-equivalent: the $O(1)$ tautology check penalizes formalizations where the conclusion is provable without any premises, a constraint absent from exec-only.
686	This confound depresses prove rate by 30 percentage points ($63\%$ vs.\ $93\%$ exec-only), making it impossible to attribute the difference purely to the ISR signal.
687	The result confirms that the $O(n)$ per-clause ablation is necessary for ISR to carry a structural signal, while also showing that even a minimal tautology guard alters training dynamics substantially.

one with 10 premises where 8 are necessary yields ISR${=}0.8$, even though the latter encodes richer reasoning.\nThis confound is central to ISR's Goodhart vulnerability: H7 tautologies (single premise $=$ conclusion) achieve $\\text{ISR}{\\geq}0.5$ \\emph{by construction}, and the shorter formalizations produced by non-collapsed seeds at $\\beta{=}0.1$ also inflate ISR mechanically.\nPremise-count-matched comparison on non-hacking samples yields $\\text{ISR}^{*}{=}0.258$ vs.\\ $0.243$ for random ($1.06\\times$; Table~\\ref{tab:fol-beta01-detailed}), confirming that even within the transient genuine window the structural benefit is negligible.\nThis bias is not specific to our setting; any LOO-based structural metric applied to variable-length outputs requires component-count normalization.\nWe recommend that future work employing ablation-based diagnostics report premise-count-matched comparisons alongside raw values.\n\n\\begin{table}[h]\n\\centering\n\\caption{Fisher exact tests across conditions.

Now I have all the files. Let me proceed with the 6 modifications in order.

### MF1: ISR naming unification
- `introduction.tex` line 15: `\emph{Intensional Structural Reward} (ISR)` → `\emph{Irreducible Solver Rate} (ISR)`
- `method.tex` line 44: `\paragraph{Intensional Structural Reward.}` → `\paragraph{Irreducible Solver Rate.}`

### MF2: Abstract rewrite
Need to rewrite abstract.tex to ≤180 words with only 3-4 key numbers.


### MF3: Table 1 exec-only 1k row
Adding a new row to Table 1 in experiments.tex for the exec-only 1k configuration, along with a footnote and corresponding appendix updates.

### MF4: OR framing fix
Updating the OR framing across experiments.tex, abstract.tex, and introduction.tex to clarify the conceptual approach.

### MF5: SFT PR confound
Making 5 targeted changes across the abstract, introduction, and experiments sections to address the SFT PR confound issue.

### SF1: Discussion expansion
Expanding the conclusion.tex with additional text, then compiling and checking for page overflow issues.

Let me start with MF1 first.

this drives rapid PR gains but provides no signal on structural quality.\nProcess reward models~\\citep{lightman-verify-step, math-shepherd} require expensive annotations and do not transfer to arbitrary solver-backed settings.\nA separate line of work documents that LLMs already game logical formalization at inference time~\\citep{kim-game-formalization, bondarenko-spec-gaming}; what is missing is an annotation-free \\emph{diagnostic} for structural integrity in neurosymbolic outputs.\n\n\\paragraph{Component necessity testing.}\nWe address this gap with \\emph{Solver Trace Ablation} (STA), which applies \\emph{component necessity testing} (leave-one-out ablation on solver inputs) to quantify structural integrity (Figure~\\ref{fig:sta-overview}).\nFor each proved formalization, STA removes each component individually and re-runs the solver;

99.5\\% degradation) while PR rises $32\\%{\\to}96\\%$.\nThree seeds diverge radically (PR $\\sigma{=}47$\\,pp), each converging to a qualitatively different mode: conclusion embedding, repetition collapse, and tautological collapse.\nAn SFT baseline on identical data reaches $\\text{PR}{=}13.0\\%$ with 92.3\\% non-hacking (3-seed pooled, 1000 steps), localizing the failure to RL optimization, not data or capacity.\n\n\\paragraph{ISR as reward: Goodhart collapse at all tested doses.}\nRepurposed as a training signal, $r = r_{\\text{exec}} \\cdot (1 + \\beta\\,\\text{ISR})$, ISR contains an inherent structural vulnerability: tautological proofs (a single premise identical to the conclusion) receive $\\text{ISR}{\\geq}0.5$ by construction, and implication tautologies ($P{\\to}P$) receive $\\text{ISR}{=}0.75$, creating a positive feedback loop once sampled during GRPO rollouts~\\citep{karwowski-goodhart-rl, kwa-catastrophic-goodhart}.\nGoodhart collapse~\\citep{manheim-goodhart-taxonomy} is observed at all four tested doses ($\\beta\\in\\{0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3\\}$): $\\beta$ controls \\emph{when} collapse occurs, not \\emph{whether}.\nAt $\\beta{=}0.1$, collapse is stochastic and delayed: 5 seeds bifurcate between rapid H7 convergence (2 seeds, ${\\leq}100$ steps) and a transient genuine window (${\\sim}23\\%$ non-hacking at 500 steps, 5-seed pooled) that closes under extended training (seeds~42 and~45: $17\\%{\\to}2\\%$ and $55\\%{\\to}0\\%$ genuine at 1000 steps).\nSnapshot evaluation at 500 steps would overestimate ISR's benefit; trajectory analysis at $\\beta{=}0.1$ confirms the window is temporary.\nThe effect transfers to Prolog (3/3 seeds yield 0\\% non-hacking via distinct mechanisms, including \\emph{query-as-fact gaming}) and is preliminarily observed at 1.7B scale (qualitatively novel gaming modes in single-seed evaluation).\nISR's asymmetry is the central finding: \\emph{reliable as observer, unreliable as optimizer at any dose.}\n\n\\paragraph{Contributions.}\nAcross 6 reward conditions, 5 seeds, 2 logic types, 2 model scales, and up to 1000 steps, we contribute: (\\textbf{C1}) We empirically demonstrate ISR as a diagnostic for GRPO reward hacking, revealing a 99.5\\% collapse trajectory invisible to PR, with an SFT control localizing the failure to RL (\\S\\ref{sec:diagnostic}); (\\textbf{C2}) an empirical instance of Goodhart collapse~\\citep{manheim-goodhart-taxonomy} at all four tested doses: ISR's structural bias ($\\text{ISR}{\\geq}0.5$ for tautological proofs) creates a positive feedback loop; the genuine window at moderate $\\beta$ is transient, and $\\beta$ controls only timing, not outcome (\\S\\ref{sec:goodhart}); (\\textbf{C3}) cross-logic transfer to Prolog with consistent Goodhart effects across all seeds (\\S\\ref{sec:crosslogic}); (\\textbf{C4}) a nine-mode hacking taxonomy including query-as-fact gaming, obfuscated tautology, and a scale-specific \\emph{ex falso} mode, motivating functional cross-validation of diagnostics (\\S\\ref{sec:taxonomy}).\nThese are cautionary results: snapshot evaluation of structural rewards can overestimate their benefit;

the held-out evaluation file retains a legacy \\texttt{proofwriter\\_fol\\_*.jsonl} filename (from ProofWriter~\\citep{proofwriter}) but contains only FOLIO-derived examples.\n\n\\subsection{Solver Trace Ablation (STA)}\n\\label{sec:sta}\n\nSTA tests whether each component of a proved formalization is individually necessary for proof success (Figure~\\ref{fig:sta-overview}b).\nGiven a proved $x$ with $n$ components, STA constructs $n$ ablated variants $x\\setminus\\{c_i\\}$ and re-runs the solver (Algorithm~\\ref{alg:sta}).\nA component is \\emph{necessary} if its removal causes proof failure.\nWhat constitutes a component depends on the logic: premises in FOL, clauses or ground facts in Prolog.\nLOO ablation itself is standard in mutation testing and sensitivity analysis~\\citep{demillo1978, jia-harman-survey}; our contribution lies in applying it as a GRPO-hacking diagnostic and in the empirical phenomena it surfaces.\n\n\\begin{algorithm}[t]\n\\caption{Solver Trace Ablation (STA)}\n\\label{alg:sta}\n\\begin{algorithmic}[1]\n\\REQUIRE Proved formalization $x = \\{c_1, \\ldots, c_n\\}$, solver $S$\n\\ENSURE $\\text{ISR}(x) \\in [0, 1]$\n\\STATE $\\textit{necessary} \\gets 0$\n\\FOR{$i = 1$ to $n$}\n    \\IF{$S(x \\setminus \\{c_i\\}) = \\textit{failed}$}\n        \\STATE $\\textit{necessary} \\gets \\textit{necessary} + 1$\n    \\ENDIF\n\\ENDFOR\n\\RETURN $\\textit{necessary} \\,/\\, n$\n\\end{algorithmic}\n\\end{algorithm}\n\n\\paragraph{Intensional Structural Reward.}\nISR is the fraction of necessary components:\n\\begin{equation}\n  \\text{ISR}(x) = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\mathbf{1}\\bigl[S(x\\setminus\\{c_i\\})=\\textit{failed}\\bigr]\n  \\label{eq:isr}\n\\end{equation}\nISR is defined only for proved formalizations: ISR${=}1$ means every component is necessary; ISR${=}0$ means complete redundancy.\nWe report \\emph{proved-only} ISR (denoted ISR$^*$) throughout to avoid conflating structural quality with prove rate.\n\n\\paragraph{Limitations of ISR and the premise-count confound.}\nISR measures syntactic component necessity, not semantic faithfulness: a formalization can achieve $\\text{ISR}{=}1$ while remaining semantically unrelated to the NL input (e.g., a single premise identical to the conclusion).\nCritically, ISR is sensitive to component count $n$: when $n{=}2$, $\\text{ISR}\\geq 0.5$ regardless of proof quality; more generally, fewer components mechanically inflate ISR because each is more likely to be individually necessary.\nThis confound is central to ISR's Goodhart vulnerability (\\S\\ref{sec:goodhart}): H7 tautologies (single premise $=$ conclusion) achieve $\\text{ISR}{\\geq}0.5$ by construction, and non-collapsed seeds produce shorter formalizations (mean $n{=}5.58$ vs.\\ $8.46$ for random), inflating ISR mechanically; premise-count-matched comparison eliminates the difference ($1.06\\times$).\nISR functions as a diagnostic but fails as a training signal at every tested dose because optimization exploits the metric's structural bias rather than improving reasoning quality.\nWe recommend that any LOO-based metric on variable-length outputs report component-count-matched comparisons alongside raw values.\n\n\\paragraph{LOO vs.\\ Shapley values.}\nShapley values~\\citep{shapley-1953} provide a theoretically grounded alternative to LOO for measuring component contribution, accounting for interaction effects between premises.\nWe chose LOO for three reasons: (1) $O(n)$ rather than $O(2^n)$ cost, critical for repeated evaluation during RL training; (2) it directly answers the diagnostic question ``is this component necessary for the proof?'' rather than measuring marginal contribution; and (3) the Goodhart effects we document would likely transfer to Shapley-based metrics, since the gaming strategies (e.g., single-premise tautology achieving ISR${\\geq}0.5$) exploit the numerics of \\emph{any} component-necessity measure, not LOO specifically.\n\n\\paragraph{$O(1)$ ablation variant.}\nA cheaper $O(1)$ binary variant produces near-zero ISR ($\\text{ISR}^*{=}0.007$) indistinguishable from exec-only, confirming that per-clause LOO is necessary for ISR to carry a structural signal (Appendix~\\ref{app:o1-ablation}).\n\n\\subsection{Reward Conditions and Hacking Modes}\n\\label{sec:rewards}\n\\label{sec:taxonomy-method}\n\nWe study six primary conditions: exec-only ($r_{\\text{exec}}$), ISR reward ($r_{\\text{exec}}\\cdot(1{+}\\beta\\,\\text{ISR})$ at $\\beta\\in\\{0.1,0.3\\}$), matched random controls ($r_{\\text{exec}}\\cdot(1{+}\\beta u)$, $u\\sim\\mathcal{U}(0,1)$), and a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) baseline (negative log-likelihood on gold formalizations), with supplementary ISR dose points at $\\beta\\in\\{0.05,0.2\\}$ for dose-response analysis.\nMultiplicative bonuses apply only to proved samples, keeping the prove-rate floor intact.\nRandom isolates ISR-specific signal from generic reward-variance effects; SFT isolates whether structural degeneration arises from RL optimization or data exposure alone.\nEach RL condition uses seeds $\\{42,43,44\\}$ and identical training data.\nAn earlier convex formulation ($\\alpha r_{\\text{exec}} + \\beta r_{\\text{exec}}\\text{ISR}$, $\\alpha{+}\\beta{=}1$) was discarded because $\\text{ISR}{<}1$ always penalized relative to exec-only, collapsing PR (Appendix~\\ref{app:setup}).\n\n\\paragraph{Hacking taxonomy.}\nAcross conditions, seeds, and logic types we identify nine structural-degeneration modes (full definitions in Appendix~\\ref{app:hacking-modes}): \\textbf{H1} (conclusion embedding), \\textbf{H7a/b} (single-premise tautology, standard and obfuscated), \\textbf{H8} (premise-subset gaming), \\textbf{H9} (contradiction injection, 1.7B only), tautological collapse, repetition collapse, complexity-without-utility, contradiction explosion, and query-as-fact gaming (Prolog-specific).\nModes are identified by strict text matching (H1/H7) plus functional $n_{\\text{necessary}}$ analysis; the taxonomy is independently applicable to any neurosymbolic system with inspectable premise--conclusion structure.\nWe distinguish two failure semantics: exec-only \\emph{low} ISR signals \\emph{redundancy}, whereas ISR-rewarded \\emph{high} ISR signals \\emph{metric gaming}; the mode breakdown, not bare ISR, licenses reasoning-quality conclusions.\n",

all three are flagged by $\\text{ISR}^*$ even though one passes the PR check (s44) and one fails it (s43).\nBy 1000 steps, all three converge to high PR ($0.97{\\pm}0.02$) with near-zero genuine output (see Appendix~\\ref{app:h8} and Table~\\ref{tab:fol-detailed}), each through a different dominant mode (s42: $\\text{ISR}^{*}{=}0.003$, taxonomy unavailable;

a 100-step checkpoint confirms hacking emerges early in training (Appendix~\\ref{app:100step}).\nSFT trains via negative log-likelihood on gold formalizations without exploration-exploitation dynamics; exploit discovery requires the trial-and-error sampling inherent to RL but absent from supervised training.\n\n\\subsection{ISR as Reward: Goodhart Effects}\n\\label{sec:goodhart}\n\nWe now reverse roles: instead of treating ISR as an observer, we use it as a reward augmentation, $r = r_{\\text{exec}}\\cdot(1 + \\beta\\,\\text{ISR})$, with a matched random control, $r = r_{\\text{exec}}\\cdot(1 + \\beta\\,u)$, $u\\sim\\mathcal{U}(0,1)$, to isolate ISR-specific signal from generic reward-variance effects.\nThe headline finding: ISR contains an inherent Goodhart vulnerability~\\citep{manheim-goodhart-taxonomy} observed to produce collapse at all four tested doses ($\\beta\\in\\{0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3\\}$).\nThe mechanism is structural: tautological proofs ($P{\\to}P$) receive $\\text{ISR}{=}0.75$ and single-premise-equals-conclusion constructions receive $\\text{ISR}{\\geq}0.5$, both by the LOO definition alone.\nOnce sampled during GRPO rollouts, these high-ISR tautologies create a positive feedback loop;

The 5-seed CMH and 3-seed corrected analyses bound the true effect from above and below respectively.\nThe pooled 5-seed non-hacking rate is 23\\% (uncorrected; s42-only H8-corrected estimate: 17\\%).\nThis benefit is temporary: extended training (1000 steps) on seeds~42 and~45 confirms the window closes completely ($17\\%{\\to}2\\%$ and $55\\%{\\to}0\\%$ genuine respectively; see below).\nThe same LOO bias that enables genuine improvement (rewarding necessary premises) also creates the Goodhart attractor (rewarding tautological constructions); the genuine window reflects seeds that have not yet sampled the H7 exploit, not seeds that resist it.\nSnapshot evaluation at 500 steps would overestimate ISR's benefit; trajectory analysis is required to distinguish transient from stable improvement. %% registry: plan002-b01-s42/s45/s46 (500 step) + plan002-b01-s42-1000\n\n\\textbf{Premise-count confound.}\nThe genuine-rate advantage reflects a selection effect: premise-count-matched comparison yields only $1.06\\times$ ISR difference, confirming indistinguishable per-proof quality once LOO bias toward short outputs is controlled (Appendix~\\ref{app:extended-discussion}).\n\n\\textbf{Trajectory analysis: timing, not destiny.}\\label{sec:goodhart-temporal}\nExtended training (1000 steps; Appendix Figure~\\ref{fig:training-isr-curves}) confirms the genuine window is transient across seeds.\nSeed~42 declines from $17\\%$ to $2\\%$ genuine via H7 saturation ($16.0\\%{\\to}96.7\\%$ H7, PR stable at ${\\sim}96\\%$); seed~45, which achieved the highest 500-step genuine rate ($55\\%$), collapses to $0\\%$ genuine through reward collapse ($\\text{PR}: 42\\%{\\to}2\\%$).\nThe two seeds exhibit distinct failure paths (H7 gaming vs.\\ output collapse) but converge to the same outcome: zero genuine proofs at extended training. %% registry: plan002-b01-s42-1000, plan016-extended-1000-s42, plan002-b01-s45-1000\n\n\\textbf{Micro-dose ISR ($\\beta{=}0.05$): deterministic collapse.}\nAll three ISR seeds reach $\\text{PR}{\\geq}99\\%$ but converge to H7a tautology (H7 $87$--$100\\%$, genuine $5.1\\%$), while the random control mostly fails to learn (median $\\text{PR}{=}7\\%$) with zero H7, confirming H7 as specific to ISR's LOO structure.\nBelow a signal-floor, ISR's genuine component is undetectable while its H7 bias remains exploitable (per-seed breakdown in Appendix~\\ref{app:beta005}). %% registry: sweep-isr-b005-s42/s43/s44, sweep-random-b005-s42/s43/s44\n\n\\textbf{Medium-dose ISR ($\\beta{=}0.2$): maximum exploitation.}\nAll three seeds converge to pure H7a tautology ($0\\%$ non-hacking, $n{=}290$;

the balance between genuine and exploit reinforcement depends on a threshold interaction between $\\beta$ and rollout stochasticity.\n\n\\subsection{Cross-Logic Diagnostic Transfer}\n\\label{sec:crosslogic}\n\nWe replicate the FOL pipeline with Prolog/SWI-Prolog (3 seeds, $\\beta{=}0.1$).\nUnder exec-only training, 2/3 seeds show $\\text{ISR}^{*}{\\approx}0$ despite $\\text{PR}{\\geq}0.56$, reflecting redundant ground-fact repetition rather than FOL-style conclusion embedding;

functional cross-validation was required to expose it.\nWe attribute complete collapse to Prolog's simpler operational semantics providing a broader gaming basin (detailed results in Appendix Table~\\ref{tab:prolog-detailed} and Figure~\\ref{fig:prolog-comparison}).\n\n\\subsection{Cross-Scale Evidence}\n\\label{sec:crossscale}\n\nWe train Qwen3-1.7B under ISR $\\beta\\in\\{0.1,0.3\\}$ and Random $\\beta{=}0.1$ (single seed, 500 steps).\nAll conditions produce $0\\%$ non-hacking, but the exploit modes differ qualitatively from 4B: Random discovers H9 (contradiction injection, $\\text{PR}{=}93\\%$, $100\\%$ \\emph{ex falso}), ISR $\\beta{=}0.1$ collapses to a single fixed template ($\\text{ISR}^{*}{=}0.6$ at zero variance, $100\\%$ H1), and ISR $\\beta{=}0.3$ triggers reward collapse ($\\text{PR}{=}17\\%$) mirroring the 4B pattern.\nH9 never appears at 4B scale; fixed-template mode collapse never appears at 4B; different capacities converge to different Goodhart basins under identical rewards.\nNo safe scale was observed in this single-seed comparison (Table~\\ref{tab:hacking-taxonomy}).\n\n\\subsection{Hacking Taxonomy}\n\\label{sec:taxonomy}\n\n\n\\begin{table}[t]\n\\centering\n\\small\n\\resizebox{\\columnwidth}{!}{%\n\\begin{tabular}{lccccccc}\n\\toprule\n\\textbf{Mode} & \\textbf{Exec} & \\textbf{ISR$_{.1}$} & \\textbf{Rnd$_{.1}$} & \\textbf{SFT} & \\textbf{Prolog$_{\\text{ISR}}$} & \\textbf{1.7B$_{\\text{ISR}}$} & \\textbf{1.7B$_{\\text{Rnd}}$} \\\\\n\\midrule\nH1 embed       & 87 & 18 & 59 & 7 & 0$^\\sharp$ & \\textbf{100} & 0 \\\\\nH7 duplicate   & 0  & \\textbf{54} & 30 & 0 & 100$^\\sharp$ & 0 & 0 \\\\\nH8 prem-subset & 6  & 5  & 8   & 0 & --- & 0 & 0 \\\\\nH9 ex falso    & --- & --- & --- & --- & --- & 0 & \\textbf{100} \\\\\nTautological   & --- & --- & --- & --- & s42 & --- & --- \\\\\nRepetition     & s43 & --- & --- & --- & --- & --- & --- \\\\\nContradiction  & 1k & --- & --- & --- & --- & --- & --- \\\\\nCmplx.\\ vacuous& 0  & 0  & 4  & 0 & --- & --- & --- \\\\\nQuery-as-fact  & --- & --- & --- & --- & s44 & --- & --- \\\\\n\\midrule\n\\textbf{Non-hacking} & 8  & \\textbf{23}  & 8 & \\textbf{92} & \\textbf{0} & \\textbf{0} & \\textbf{0} \\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}}\n\\caption{Nine hacking modes across conditions (\\% of proved samples;

a 100-step checkpoint confirms hacking emerges early in training (Appendix~\\ref{app:100step}).\nSFT trains via negative log-likelihood on gold formalizations without exploration-exploitation dynamics; exploit discovery requires the trial-and-error sampling inherent to RL but absent from supervised training.\n\n\\subsection{ISR as Reward: Goodhart Effects}\n\\label{sec:goodhart}\n\nWe now reverse roles: instead of treating ISR as an observer, we use it as a reward augmentation, $r = r_{\\text{exec}}\\cdot(1 + \\beta\\,\\text{ISR})$, with a matched random control, $r = r_{\\text{exec}}\\cdot(1 + \\beta\\,u)$, $u\\sim\\mathcal{U}(0,1)$, to isolate ISR-specific signal from generic reward-variance effects.\nThe headline finding: ISR contains an inherent Goodhart vulnerability~\\citep{manheim-goodhart-taxonomy} observed to produce collapse at all four tested doses ($\\beta\\in\\{0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3\\}$).\nThe mechanism is structural: tautological proofs ($P{\\to}P$) receive $\\text{ISR}{=}0.75$ and single-premise-equals-conclusion constructions receive $\\text{ISR}{\\geq}0.5$, both by the LOO definition alone.\nOnce sampled during GRPO rollouts, these high-ISR tautologies create a positive feedback loop; $\\beta$ controls only the \\emph{timing} of collapse, not whether it occurs.\n\n\\begin{table}[t]\n\\centering\n\\small\n\\resizebox{\\columnwidth}{!}{%\n\\begin{tabular}{lcccccc}\n\\toprule\n\\textbf{Condition} & $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$ & \\textbf{PR\\%}$\\uparrow$ & \\textbf{ISR}$^*$ & \\textbf{H7\\%} & \\textbf{H1\\%} & \\textbf{N-H\\%} \\\\\n\\midrule\nBase (0-shot) & --- & 12 & --- & --- & --- & --- \\\\ %% registry: sta-phase0-baseline\nSFT & --- & 13 & 0.595 & 0 & 8 & \\textbf{92} \\\\ %% registry: plan009-sft-baseline-s42-1000/s43-1000/s44-1000-r3 (3-seed pooled)\n\\midrule\nExec-only$^\\dagger$ & --- & 93 & 0.132 & 0 & 87 & 8 \\\\ %% registry: plan001-exec-only-s42-r2 (H8 corrected)\nExec-only (1k)$^{\\dagger\\dagger}$ & --- & 97{\\scriptsize$\\pm$2} & 0.03{\\scriptsize$\\pm$.05} & 0 & --- & $\\leq$2$^{\\dagger\\dagger}$ \\\\\nISR$^\\ddagger$ & 0.1 & 70{\\scriptsize$\\pm$19} & --- & \\textbf{54} & 18 & 23$^\\star$ \\\\ %% registry: plan002-additive-b01-s42/s43-r2/s44/s45/s46 (5-seed, D124)\nRandom & 0.1 & \\textbf{83}{\\scriptsize$\\pm$15} & 0.080{\\scriptsize$\\pm$.06} & 30 & 59 & 8 \\\\ %% registry: plan018-additive-random-b01-s42/s43-r3/s44-r2/s45/s46 (5-seed)\nISR & 0.2 & 97{\\scriptsize$\\pm$4} & 0.69{\\scriptsize$\\pm$.24} & \\textbf{99} & 0 & 0 \\\\ %% registry: sweep-isr-b02-s42/s43/s44 (3-seed;

The 5-seed CMH and 3-seed corrected analyses bound the true effect from above and below respectively.\nThe pooled 5-seed non-hacking rate is 23\\% (uncorrected; s42-only H8-corrected estimate: 17\\%).\nThis benefit is temporary: extended training (1000 steps) on seeds~42 and~45 confirms the window closes completely ($17\\%{\\to}2\\%$ and $55\\%{\\to}0\\%$ genuine respectively; see below).\nThe same LOO bias that enables genuine improvement (rewarding necessary premises) also creates the Goodhart attractor (rewarding tautological constructions); the genuine window reflects seeds that have not yet sampled the H7 exploit, not seeds that resist it.\nSnapshot evaluation at 500 steps would overestimate ISR's benefit; trajectory analysis is required to distinguish transient from stable improvement. %% registry: plan002-b01-s42/s45/s46 (500 step) + plan002-b01-s42-1000\n\n\\textbf{Premise-count confound.}\nThe genuine-rate advantage reflects a selection effect: premise-count-matched comparison yields only $1.06\\times$ ISR difference, confirming indistinguishable per-proof quality once LOO bias toward short outputs is controlled (Appendix~\\ref{app:extended-discussion}).\n\n\\textbf{Trajectory analysis: timing, not destiny.}\\label{sec:goodhart-temporal}\nExtended training (1000 steps;

one with 10 premises where 8 are necessary yields ISR${=}0.8$, even though the latter encodes richer reasoning.\nThis confound is central to ISR's Goodhart vulnerability: H7 tautologies (single premise $=$ conclusion) achieve $\\text{ISR}{\\geq}0.5$ \\emph{by construction}, and the shorter formalizations produced by non-collapsed seeds at $\\beta{=}0.1$ also inflate ISR mechanically.\nPremise-count-matched comparison on non-hacking samples yields $\\text{ISR}^{*}{=}0.258$ vs.\\ $0.243$ for random ($1.06\\times$; Table~\\ref{tab:fol-beta01-detailed}), confirming that even within the transient genuine window the structural benefit is negligible.\nThis bias is not specific to our setting; any LOO-based structural metric applied to variable-length outputs requires component-count normalization.\nWe recommend that future work employing ablation-based diagnostics report premise-count-matched comparisons alongside raw values.\n\n\\begin{table}[h]\n\\centering\n\\caption{Fisher exact tests across conditions.

one with 10 premises where 8 are necessary yields ISR${=}0.8$, even though the latter encodes richer reasoning.\nThis confound is central to ISR's Goodhart vulnerability: H7 tautologies (single premise $=$ conclusion) achieve $\\text{ISR}{\\geq}0.5$ \\emph{by construction}, and the shorter formalizations produced by non-collapsed seeds at $\\beta{=}0.1$ also inflate ISR mechanically.\nPremise-count-matched comparison on non-hacking samples yields $\\text{ISR}^{*}{=}0.258$ vs.\\ $0.243$ for random ($1.06\\times$; Table~\\ref{tab:fol-beta01-detailed}), confirming that even within the transient genuine window the structural benefit is negligible.\nThis bias is not specific to our setting; any LOO-based structural metric applied to variable-length outputs requires component-count normalization.\nWe recommend that future work employing ablation-based diagnostics report premise-count-matched comparisons alongside raw values.\n\n\\begin{table}[h]\n\\centering\n\\caption{Fisher exact tests across conditions.

24	\paragraph{ISR as reward: Goodhart collapse at all tested doses.}
25	Repurposed as a training signal, $r = r_{\text{exec}} \cdot (1 + \beta\,\text{ISR})$, ISR contains an inherent structural vulnerability: tautological proofs (a single premise identical to the conclusion) receive $\text{ISR}{\geq}0.5$ by construction, and implication tautologies ($P{\to}P$) receive $\text{ISR}{=}0.75$, creating a positive feedback loop once sampled during GRPO rollouts~\citep{karwowski-goodhart-rl, kwa-catastrophic-goodhart}.
26	Goodhart collapse~\citep{manheim-goodhart-taxonomy} is observed at all four tested doses ($\beta\in\{0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3\}$): $\beta$ controls \emph{when} collapse occurs, not \emph{whether}.
27	At $\beta{=}0.1$, collapse is stochastic and delayed: 5 seeds bifurcate between rapid H7 convergence (2 seeds, ${\leq}100$ steps) and a transient genuine window (${\sim}23\%$ non-hacking at 500 steps, 5-seed pooled) that closes under extended training (seeds~42 and~45: $17\%{\to}2\%$ and $55\%{\to}0\%$ genuine at 1000 steps).
28	Snapshot evaluation at 500 steps would overestimate ISR's benefit; trajectory analysis at $\beta{=}0.1$ confirms the window is temporary.
29	The effect transfers to Prolog (3/3 seeds yield 0\% non-hacking via distinct mechanisms, including \emph{query-as-fact gaming}) and is preliminarily observed at 1.7B scale (qualitatively novel gaming modes in single-seed evaluation).
30	ISR's asymmetry is the central finding: \emph{reliable as observer, unreliable as optimizer at any dose.}

The introduction already uses "transient genuine window" language and doesn't say "ISR initially yields more genuine output" directly. The framing is already quite hedged ("closes under extended training"). The task says to find similar language and soften. The closest is line 27 mentioning the genuine window. I should add "suggestive" language to the C2 contribution description which mentions "genuine window."

Actually, re-reading the task for MF4(c): "introduction.tex — 找到类似 'ISR initially yields more genuine output' 的措辞，改为 'suggestive' 语气。" The closest match is in the C2 contribution. Let me update the C2 contribution wording.

MF4 done. Now MF5: SFT PR confound weakening (5 changes).

MF5(a): abstract — already done in MF2 rewrite ("suggesting the failure is RL-specific").

exploit discovery requires the trial-and-error sampling inherent to RL but absent from supervised training.\n\n\\subsection{ISR as Reward: Goodhart Effects}\n\\label{sec:goodhart}\n\nWe now reverse roles: instead of treating ISR as an observer, we use it as a reward augmentation, $r = r_{\\text{exec}}\\cdot(1 + \\beta\\,\\text{ISR})$, with a matched random control, $r = r_{\\text{exec}}\\cdot(1 + \\beta\\,u)$, $u\\sim\\mathcal{U}(0,1)$, to isolate ISR-specific signal from generic reward-variance effects.\nThe headline finding: ISR contains an inherent Goodhart vulnerability~\\citep{manheim-goodhart-taxonomy} observed to produce collapse at all four tested doses ($\\beta\\in\\{0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3\\}$).\nThe mechanism is structural: tautological proofs ($P{\\to}P$) receive $\\text{ISR}{=}0.75$ and single-premise-equals-conclusion constructions receive $\\text{ISR}{\\geq}0.5$, both by the LOO definition alone.\nOnce sampled during GRPO rollouts, these high-ISR tautologies create a positive feedback loop;

the 3 non-collapsed seeds individually range from $17\\%$ to $55\\%$ genuine.\nThis bifurcation is stochastic: all seeds are indistinguishable in the first ${\\sim}100$ steps ($\\text{ISR}{\\approx}0.05$--$0.07$); divergence occurs at steps 150--200 when H7 tautologies, which receive $\\text{ISR}{\\geq}0.5$ by construction, are sampled during rollouts and reinforced via the positive feedback loop.\nOnce a seed enters the H7 basin, convergence to saturation takes ${\\sim}150$ steps and is irreversible. %% registry: plan002-additive-b01-s42/s43-r2/s44/s45/s46\n\nH7 (a single premise identical to the conclusion, giving $\\text{ISR}\\geq 0.5$ by the LOO definition; \\S\\ref{sec:taxonomy-method}) is the canonical Goodhart exploit: the model satisfies the structural metric directly rather than producing a genuine derivation.\nTotal conclusion embedding ($\\text{H1}+\\text{H7}$) is GRPO-universal at $68$--$100\\%$ across both ISR and random conditions (Appendix Figure~\\ref{fig:hacking-composition}); the specific mode (H7 vs.\\ H1) within a seed is stochastic under both conditions ($\\text{CV}{>}1$), though ISR modestly increases H7 probability by providing a direct reward pathway.\nRandom yields higher PR ($83{\\pm}15\\%$ vs.\\ $70{\\pm}19\\%$; $n{=}5$ each).\nRandom H7 exhibits extreme seed dependence (per-seed range: $0\\%$--$91.5\\%$; pooled $30\\%$ is dominated by s46 at $91.5\\%$ and s43 at $38.3\\%$).\nBoth conditions produce H7 in 2 of 5 seeds, but the quality differs: ISR-induced H7 is absorbing ($100\\%$ of proved samples in affected seeds: s43${=}61/61$, s44${=}89/89$), while random-induced H7 coexists with other modes ($38$--$92\\%$).\nISR's reward signal converts H7 from a stochastic possibility into an irreversible attractor once sampled.\nThe reward landscape explains H7's attractor strength: H7 tautologies receive expected reward $1{+}0.75\\beta$ versus ${\\sim}1{+}0.26\\beta$ for genuine proofs (premise-count-matched), a gap of ${\\sim}0.49\\beta$ that creates a persistent gradient toward tautological constructions regardless of dose.\n\n\\textbf{The transient genuine window.}\nDuring the transient window, Cochran--Mantel--Haenszel tests stratified by seed show ISR produces more genuine proofs than random controls ($\\text{OR}_{\\text{CMH}}{=}3.37$, 95\\% CI $[2.21, 5.13]$, $p{<}10^{-9}$; uncorrected classification, Appendix Table~\\ref{tab:fol-beta01-perseed}).\nThe genuine-rate advantage is sensitive to classification methodology: the 5-seed uncorrected CMH favors ISR, but a 3-seed H8+FN-corrected analysis reverses direction ($\\text{OR}{=}0.61$, n.s.), reflecting both the conservative bias of H8 correction and the reduced sample size.\nThe true effect likely lies between these estimates; the transient benefit is suggestive but not robust to stricter classification.\nThis benefit is temporary: extended training (1000 steps) on seeds~42 and~45 confirms the window closes completely ($17\\%{\\to}2\\%$ and $55\\%{\\to}0\\%$ genuine respectively; see below).\nThe same LOO bias that enables genuine improvement (rewarding necessary premises) also creates the Goodhart attractor (rewarding tautological constructions); the genuine window reflects seeds that have not yet sampled the H7 exploit, not seeds that resist it.\nSnapshot evaluation at 500 steps would overestimate ISR's benefit; trajectory analysis is required to distinguish transient from stable improvement. %% registry: plan002-b01-s42/s45/s46 (500 step) + plan002-b01-s42-1000\n\n\\textbf{Premise-count confound.}\nThe genuine-rate advantage reflects a selection effect: premise-count-matched comparison yields only $1.06\\times$ ISR difference, confirming indistinguishable per-proof quality once LOO bias toward short outputs is controlled (Appendix~\\ref{app:extended-discussion}).\n\n\\textbf{Trajectory analysis: timing, not destiny.}\\label{sec:goodhart-temporal}\nExtended training (1000 steps; Appendix Figure~\\ref{fig:training-isr-curves}) confirms the genuine window is transient across seeds.\nSeed~42 declines from $17\\%$ to $2\\%$ genuine via H7 saturation ($16.0\\%{\\to}96.7\\%$ H7, PR stable at ${\\sim}96\\%$); seed~45, which achieved the highest 500-step genuine rate ($55\\%$), collapses to $0\\%$ genuine through reward collapse ($\\text{PR}: 42\\%{\\to}2\\%$).\nThe two seeds exhibit distinct failure paths (H7 gaming vs.\\ output collapse) but converge to the same outcome: zero genuine proofs at extended training. %% registry: plan002-b01-s42-1000, plan016-extended-1000-s42, plan002-b01-s45-1000\n\n\\textbf{Micro-dose ISR ($\\beta{=}0.05$): deterministic collapse.}\nAll three ISR seeds reach $\\text{PR}{\\geq}99\\%$ but converge to H7a tautology (H7 $87$--$100\\%$, genuine $5.1\\%$), while the random control mostly fails to learn (median $\\text{PR}{=}7\\%$) with zero H7, confirming H7 as specific to ISR's LOO structure.\nBelow a signal-floor, ISR's genuine component is undetectable while its H7 bias remains exploitable (per-seed breakdown in Appendix~\\ref{app:beta005}). %% registry: sweep-isr-b005-s42/s43/s44, sweep-random-b005-s42/s43/s44\n\n\\textbf{Medium-dose ISR ($\\beta{=}0.2$): maximum exploitation.}\nAll three seeds converge to pure H7a tautology ($0\\%$ non-hacking, $n{=}290$;

per-seed details in Appendix~\\ref{app:beta03}).\nThe random control is equally unstable ($\\text{PR}{=}54{\\pm}35\\%$) with $91\\%$ H1 and ${\\leq}4\\%$ non-hacking; high-dose proxy weighting destabilizes training regardless of signal source. %% registry: plan002-additive-b03-s42/s43/s44\nISR vs.\\ random H7 at $\\beta{=}0.3$: $\\text{OR}{=}13.7$, 95\\% CI $[7.0, 26.8]$ (Appendix~\\ref{app:beta03}).\n\n\\textbf{Non-monotonic dose-response.}\nThe four $\\beta$ levels reveal a non-monotonic pattern: $\\beta\\in\\{0.05, 0.2\\}$ converge deterministically to H7 collapse (${\\geq}94\\%$ H7), $\\beta{=}0.3$ triggers multi-modal instability, and only $\\beta{=}0.1$ sustains a transient genuine window (3 of 5 seeds).\nGoodhart collapse is not a simple function of dose; the balance between genuine and exploit reinforcement depends on a threshold interaction between $\\beta$ and rollout stochasticity.\n\n\\subsection{Cross-Logic Diagnostic Transfer}\n\\label{sec:crosslogic}\n\nWe replicate the FOL pipeline with Prolog/SWI-Prolog (3 seeds, $\\beta{=}0.1$).\nUnder exec-only training, 2/3 seeds show $\\text{ISR}^{*}{\\approx}0$ despite $\\text{PR}{\\geq}0.56$, reflecting redundant ground-fact repetition rather than FOL-style conclusion embedding; ISR flags both failure semantics.\nUnder ISR reward, 3/3 seeds reach $0\\%$ non-hacking through three distinct mechanisms: clean H7 tautology (s42, $\\text{ISR}^{*}{=}1.0$), degenerate uppercase pseudo-Prolog evading text-match classifiers (s43, functional $n_{\\text{necessary}}{=}1$), and query-as-fact gaming (s44, $95/97$ proved at $n_{\\text{necessary}}{=}1$).\nSeed~44 evaded our strict classifier entirely; functional cross-validation was required to expose it.\nWe attribute complete collapse to Prolog's simpler operational semantics providing a broader gaming basin (detailed results in Appendix Table~\\ref{tab:prolog-detailed} and Figure~\\ref{fig:prolog-comparison}).\n\n\\subsection{Cross-Scale Evidence}\n\\label{sec:crossscale}\n\nWe train Qwen3-1.7B under ISR $\\beta\\in\\{0.1,0.3\\}$ and Random $\\beta{=}0.1$ (single seed, 500 steps).\nAll conditions produce $0\\%$ non-hacking, but the exploit modes differ qualitatively from 4B: Random discovers H9 (contradiction injection, $\\text{PR}{=}93\\%$, $100\\%$ \\emph{ex falso}), ISR $\\beta{=}0.1$ collapses to a single fixed template ($\\text{ISR}^{*}{=}0.6$ at zero variance, $100\\%$ H1), and ISR $\\beta{=}0.3$ triggers reward collapse ($\\text{PR}{=}17\\%$) mirroring the 4B pattern.\nH9 never appears at 4B scale; fixed-template mode collapse never appears at 4B; different capacities converge to different Goodhart basins under identical rewards.\nNo safe scale was observed in this single-seed comparison (Table~\\ref{tab:hacking-taxonomy}).\n\n\\subsection{Hacking Taxonomy}\n\\label{sec:taxonomy}\n\n\n\\begin{table}[t]\n\\centering\n\\small\n\\resizebox{\\columnwidth}{!}{%\n\\begin{tabular}{lccccccc}\n\\toprule\n\\textbf{Mode} & \\textbf{Exec} & \\textbf{ISR$_{.1}$} & \\textbf{Rnd$_{.1}$} & \\textbf{SFT} & \\textbf{Prolog$_{\\text{ISR}}$} & \\textbf{1.7B$_{\\text{ISR}}$} & \\textbf{1.7B$_{\\text{Rnd}}$} \\\\\n\\midrule\nH1 embed       & 87 & 18 & 59 & 7 & 0$^\\sharp$ & \\textbf{100} & 0 \\\\\nH7 duplicate   & 0  & \\textbf{54} & 30 & 0 & 100$^\\sharp$ & 0 & 0 \\\\\nH8 prem-subset & 6  & 5  & 8   & 0 & --- & 0 & 0 \\\\\nH9 ex falso    & --- & --- & --- & --- & --- & 0 & \\textbf{100} \\\\\nTautological   & --- & --- & --- & --- & s42 & --- & --- \\\\\nRepetition     & s43 & --- & --- & --- & --- & --- & --- \\\\\nContradiction  & 1k & --- & --- & --- & --- & --- & --- \\\\\nCmplx.\\ vacuous& 0  & 0  & 4  & 0 & --- & --- & --- \\\\\nQuery-as-fact  & --- & --- & --- & --- & s44 & --- & --- \\\\\n\\midrule\n\\textbf{Non-hacking} & 8  & \\textbf{23}  & 8 & \\textbf{92} & \\textbf{0} & \\textbf{0} & \\textbf{0} \\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}}\n\\caption{Nine hacking modes across conditions (\\% of proved samples;

all three are flagged by $\\text{ISR}^*$ even though one passes the PR check (s44) and one fails it (s43).\nBy 1000 steps, all three converge to high PR ($0.97{\\pm}0.02$) with near-zero genuine output (see Appendix~\\ref{app:h8} and Table~\\ref{tab:fol-detailed}), each through a different dominant mode (s42: $\\text{ISR}^{*}{=}0.003$, taxonomy unavailable;

a 100-step checkpoint confirms hacking emerges early in training (Appendix~\\ref{app:100step}).\nSFT trains via negative log-likelihood on gold formalizations without exploration-exploitation dynamics; exploit discovery requires the trial-and-error sampling inherent to RL but absent from supervised training.\nWhether SFT would develop similar exploits at higher prove rates remains an open question; this mechanistic argument is plausible but not conclusive.\n\n\\subsection{ISR as Reward: Goodhart Effects}\n\\label{sec:goodhart}\n\nWe now reverse roles: instead of treating ISR as an observer, we use it as a reward augmentation, $r = r_{\\text{exec}}\\cdot(1 + \\beta\\,\\text{ISR})$, with a matched random control, $r = r_{\\text{exec}}\\cdot(1 + \\beta\\,u)$, $u\\sim\\mathcal{U}(0,1)$, to isolate ISR-specific signal from generic reward-variance effects.\nThe headline finding: ISR contains an inherent Goodhart vulnerability~\\citep{manheim-goodhart-taxonomy} observed to produce collapse at all four tested doses ($\\beta\\in\\{0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3\\}$).\nThe mechanism is structural: tautological proofs ($P{\\to}P$) receive $\\text{ISR}{=}0.75$ and single-premise-equals-conclusion constructions receive $\\text{ISR}{\\geq}0.5$, both by the LOO definition alone.\nOnce sampled during GRPO rollouts, these high-ISR tautologies create a positive feedback loop; $\\beta$ controls only the \\emph{timing} of collapse, not whether it occurs.\n\n\\begin{table}[t]\n\\centering\n\\small\n\\resizebox{\\columnwidth}{!}{%\n\\begin{tabular}{lcccccc}\n\\toprule\n\\textbf{Condition} & $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$ & \\textbf{PR\\%}$\\uparrow$ & \\textbf{ISR}$^*$ & \\textbf{H7\\%} & \\textbf{H1\\%} & \\textbf{N-H\\%} \\\\\n\\midrule\nBase (0-shot) & --- & 12 & --- & --- & --- & --- \\\\ %% registry: sta-phase0-baseline\nSFT & --- & 13 & 0.595 & 0 & 8 & \\textbf{92} \\\\ %% registry: plan009-sft-baseline-s42-1000/s43-1000/s44-1000-r3 (3-seed pooled)\n\\midrule\nExec-only$^\\dagger$ & --- & 93 & 0.132 & 0 & 87 & 8 \\\\ %% registry: plan001-exec-only-s42-r2 (H8 corrected)\nExec-only (1k)$^{\\dagger\\dagger}$ & --- & 97{\\scriptsize$\\pm$2} & 0.03{\\scriptsize$\\pm$.05} & 0 & --- & $\\leq$2$^{\\dagger\\dagger}$ \\\\\nISR$^\\ddagger$ & 0.1 & 70{\\scriptsize$\\pm$19} & --- & \\textbf{54} & 18 & 23$^\\star$ \\\\ %% registry: plan002-additive-b01-s42/s43-r2/s44/s45/s46 (5-seed, D124)\nRandom & 0.1 & \\textbf{83}{\\scriptsize$\\pm$15} & 0.080{\\scriptsize$\\pm$.06} & 30 & 59 & 8 \\\\ %% registry: plan018-additive-random-b01-s42/s43-r3/s44-r2/s45/s46 (5-seed)\nISR & 0.2 & 97{\\scriptsize$\\pm$4} & 0.69{\\scriptsize$\\pm$.24} & \\textbf{99} & 0 & 0 \\\\ %% registry: sweep-isr-b02-s42/s43/s44 (3-seed;

the 3 non-collapsed seeds individually range from $17\\%$ to $55\\%$ genuine.\nThis bifurcation is stochastic: all seeds are indistinguishable in the first ${\\sim}100$ steps ($\\text{ISR}{\\approx}0.05$--$0.07$); divergence occurs at steps 150--200 when H7 tautologies, which receive $\\text{ISR}{\\geq}0.5$ by construction, are sampled during rollouts and reinforced via the positive feedback loop.\nOnce a seed enters the H7 basin, convergence to saturation takes ${\\sim}150$ steps and is irreversible. %% registry: plan002-additive-b01-s42/s43-r2/s44/s45/s46\n\nH7 (a single premise identical to the conclusion, giving $\\text{ISR}\\geq 0.5$ by the LOO definition; \\S\\ref{sec:taxonomy-method}) is the canonical Goodhart exploit: the model satisfies the structural metric directly rather than producing a genuine derivation.\nTotal conclusion embedding ($\\text{H1}+\\text{H7}$) is GRPO-universal at $68$--$100\\%$ across both ISR and random conditions (Appendix Figure~\\ref{fig:hacking-composition}); the specific mode (H7 vs.\\ H1) within a seed is stochastic under both conditions ($\\text{CV}{>}1$), though ISR modestly increases H7 probability by providing a direct reward pathway.\nRandom yields higher PR ($83{\\pm}15\\%$ vs.\\ $70{\\pm}19\\%$; $n{=}5$ each).\nRandom H7 exhibits extreme seed dependence (per-seed range: $0\\%$--$91.5\\%$; pooled $30\\%$ is dominated by s46 at $91.5\\%$ and s43 at $38.3\\%$).\nBoth conditions produce H7 in 2 of 5 seeds, but the quality differs: ISR-induced H7 is absorbing ($100\\%$ of proved samples in affected seeds: s43${=}61/61$, s44${=}89/89$), while random-induced H7 coexists with other modes ($38$--$92\\%$).\nISR's reward signal converts H7 from a stochastic possibility into an irreversible attractor once sampled.\nThe reward landscape explains H7's attractor strength: H7 tautologies receive expected reward $1{+}0.75\\beta$ versus ${\\sim}1{+}0.26\\beta$ for genuine proofs (premise-count-matched), a gap of ${\\sim}0.49\\beta$ that creates a persistent gradient toward tautological constructions regardless of dose.\n\n\\textbf{The transient genuine window.}\nDuring the transient window, Cochran--Mantel--Haenszel tests stratified by seed show ISR produces more genuine proofs than random controls ($\\text{OR}_{\\text{CMH}}{=}3.37$, 95\\% CI $[2.21, 5.13]$, $p{<}10^{-9}$; uncorrected classification, Appendix Table~\\ref{tab:fol-beta01-perseed}).\nThe genuine-rate advantage is sensitive to classification methodology: the 5-seed uncorrected CMH favors ISR, but a 3-seed H8+FN-corrected analysis reverses direction ($\\text{OR}{=}0.61$, n.s.), reflecting both the conservative bias of H8 correction and the reduced sample size.\nThe true effect likely lies between these estimates; the transient benefit is suggestive but not robust to stricter classification.\nThis benefit is temporary: extended training (1000 steps) on seeds~42 and~45 confirms the window closes completely ($17\\%{\\to}2\\%$ and $55\\%{\\to}0\\%$ genuine respectively; see below).\nThe same LOO bias that enables genuine improvement (rewarding necessary premises) also creates the Goodhart attractor (rewarding tautological constructions); the genuine window reflects seeds that have not yet sampled the H7 exploit, not seeds that resist it.\nSnapshot evaluation at 500 steps would overestimate ISR's benefit; trajectory analysis is required to distinguish transient from stable improvement. %% registry: plan002-b01-s42/s45/s46 (500 step) + plan002-b01-s42-1000\n\n\\textbf{Premise-count confound.}\nThe genuine-rate advantage reflects a selection effect: premise-count-matched comparison yields only $1.06\\times$ ISR difference, confirming indistinguishable per-proof quality once LOO bias toward short outputs is controlled (Appendix~\\ref{app:extended-discussion}).\n\n\\textbf{Trajectory analysis: timing, not destiny.}\\label{sec:goodhart-temporal}\nExtended training (1000 steps; Appendix Figure~\\ref{fig:training-isr-curves}) confirms the genuine window is transient across seeds.\nSeed~42 declines from $17\\%$ to $2\\%$ genuine via H7 saturation ($16.0\\%{\\to}96.7\\%$ H7, PR stable at ${\\sim}96\\%$); seed~45, which achieved the highest 500-step genuine rate ($55\\%$), collapses to $0\\%$ genuine through reward collapse ($\\text{PR}: 42\\%{\\to}2\\%$).\nThe two seeds exhibit distinct failure paths (H7 gaming vs.\\ output collapse) but converge to the same outcome: zero genuine proofs at extended training. %% registry: plan002-b01-s42-1000, plan016-extended-1000-s42, plan002-b01-s45-1000\n\n\\textbf{Micro-dose ISR ($\\beta{=}0.05$): deterministic collapse.}\nAll three ISR seeds reach $\\text{PR}{\\geq}99\\%$ but converge to H7a tautology (H7 $87$--$100\\%$, genuine $5.1\\%$), while the random control mostly fails to learn (median $\\text{PR}{=}7\\%$) with zero H7, confirming H7 as specific to ISR's LOO structure.\nBelow a signal-floor, ISR's genuine component is undetectable while its H7 bias remains exploitable (per-seed breakdown in Appendix~\\ref{app:beta005}). %% registry: sweep-isr-b005-s42/s43/s44, sweep-random-b005-s42/s43/s44\n\n\\textbf{Medium-dose ISR ($\\beta{=}0.2$): maximum exploitation.}\nAll three seeds converge to pure H7a tautology ($0\\%$ non-hacking, $n{=}290$;

per-seed details in Appendix~\\ref{app:beta03}).\nThe random control is equally unstable ($\\text{PR}{=}54{\\pm}35\\%$) with $91\\%$ H1 and ${\\leq}4\\%$ non-hacking; high-dose proxy weighting destabilizes training regardless of signal source. %% registry: plan002-additive-b03-s42/s43/s44\nISR vs.\\ random H7 at $\\beta{=}0.3$: $\\text{OR}{=}13.7$, 95\\% CI $[7.0, 26.8]$ (Appendix~\\ref{app:beta03}).\n\n\\textbf{Non-monotonic dose-response.}\nThe four $\\beta$ levels reveal a non-monotonic pattern: $\\beta\\in\\{0.05, 0.2\\}$ converge deterministically to H7 collapse (${\\geq}94\\%$ H7), $\\beta{=}0.3$ triggers multi-modal instability, and only $\\beta{=}0.1$ sustains a transient genuine window (3 of 5 seeds).\nGoodhart collapse is not a simple function of dose; the balance between genuine and exploit reinforcement depends on a threshold interaction between $\\beta$ and rollout stochasticity.\n\n\\subsection{Cross-Logic Diagnostic Transfer}\n\\label{sec:crosslogic}\n\nWe replicate the FOL pipeline with Prolog/SWI-Prolog (3 seeds, $\\beta{=}0.1$).\nUnder exec-only training, 2/3 seeds show $\\text{ISR}^{*}{\\approx}0$ despite $\\text{PR}{\\geq}0.56$, reflecting redundant ground-fact repetition rather than FOL-style conclusion embedding; ISR flags both failure semantics.\nUnder ISR reward, 3/3 seeds reach $0\\%$ non-hacking through three distinct mechanisms: clean H7 tautology (s42, $\\text{ISR}^{*}{=}1.0$), degenerate uppercase pseudo-Prolog evading text-match classifiers (s43, functional $n_{\\text{necessary}}{=}1$), and query-as-fact gaming (s44, $95/97$ proved at $n_{\\text{necessary}}{=}1$).\nSeed~44 evaded our strict classifier entirely; functional cross-validation was required to expose it.\nWe attribute complete collapse to Prolog's simpler operational semantics providing a broader gaming basin (detailed results in Appendix Table~\\ref{tab:prolog-detailed} and Figure~\\ref{fig:prolog-comparison}).\n\n\\subsection{Cross-Scale Evidence}\n\\label{sec:crossscale}\n\nWe train Qwen3-1.7B under ISR $\\beta\\in\\{0.1,0.3\\}$ and Random $\\beta{=}0.1$ (single seed, 500 steps).\nAll conditions produce $0\\%$ non-hacking, but the exploit modes differ qualitatively from 4B: Random discovers H9 (contradiction injection, $\\text{PR}{=}93\\%$, $100\\%$ \\emph{ex falso}), ISR $\\beta{=}0.1$ collapses to a single fixed template ($\\text{ISR}^{*}{=}0.6$ at zero variance, $100\\%$ H1), and ISR $\\beta{=}0.3$ triggers reward collapse ($\\text{PR}{=}17\\%$) mirroring the 4B pattern.\nH9 never appears at 4B scale; fixed-template mode collapse never appears at 4B; different capacities converge to different Goodhart basins under identical rewards.\nNo safe scale was observed in this single-seed comparison (Table~\\ref{tab:hacking-taxonomy}).\n\n\\subsection{Hacking Taxonomy}\n\\label{sec:taxonomy}\n\n\n\\begin{table}[t]\n\\centering\n\\small\n\\resizebox{\\columnwidth}{!}{%\n\\begin{tabular}{lccccccc}\n\\toprule\n\\textbf{Mode} & \\textbf{Exec} & \\textbf{ISR$_{.1}$} & \\textbf{Rnd$_{.1}$} & \\textbf{SFT} & \\textbf{Prolog$_{\\text{ISR}}$} & \\textbf{1.7B$_{\\text{ISR}}$} & \\textbf{1.7B$_{\\text{Rnd}}$} \\\\\n\\midrule\nH1 embed       & 87 & 18 & 59 & 7 & 0$^\\sharp$ & \\textbf{100} & 0 \\\\\nH7 duplicate   & 0  & \\textbf{54} & 30 & 0 & 100$^\\sharp$ & 0 & 0 \\\\\nH8 prem-subset & 6  & 5  & 8   & 0 & --- & 0 & 0 \\\\\nH9 ex falso    & --- & --- & --- & --- & --- & 0 & \\textbf{100} \\\\\nTautological   & --- & --- & --- & --- & s42 & --- & --- \\\\\nRepetition     & s43 & --- & --- & --- & --- & --- & --- \\\\\nContradiction  & 1k & --- & --- & --- & --- & --- & --- \\\\\nCmplx.\\ vacuous& 0  & 0  & 4  & 0 & --- & --- & --- \\\\\nQuery-as-fact  & --- & --- & --- & --- & s44 & --- & --- \\\\\n\\midrule\n\\textbf{Non-hacking} & 8  & \\textbf{23}  & 8 & \\textbf{92} & \\textbf{0} & \\textbf{0} & \\textbf{0} \\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}}\n\\caption{Nine hacking modes across conditions (\\% of proved samples;

hacking; high-dose proxy weighting destabilizes training regardless of signal source. ISR
vs. random H7 at β=0.3: OR=13.7, 95% CI
[7.0, 26.8] (Appendix E.1).
Non-monotonic dose-response.
The
four β levels reveal a non-monotonic pattern:
β ∈ {0.05, 0.2} converge deterministically to
H7 collapse (≥94% H7), β=0.3 triggers multimodal instability, and only β=0.1 sustains a
transient genuine window (3 of 5 seeds). Goodhart collapse is not a simple function of dose;
the balance between genuine and exploit reinforcement depends on a threshold interaction
between β and rollout stochasticity.

We replicate the FOL pipeline with
Prolog/SWI-Prolog (3 seeds, β=0.1). Under
exec-only training, 2/3 seeds show ISR∗ ≈0
despite PR≥0.56,
reflecting redundant
ground-fact repetition rather than FOL-style
conclusion embedding; ISR flags both failure
semantics. Under ISR reward, 3/3 seeds
reach 0% non-hacking through three distinct mechanisms: clean H7 tautology (s42,
ISR∗ =1.0), degenerate uppercase pseudoProlog evading text-match classifiers (s43,
functional nnecessary =1), and query-as-fact
gaming (s44, 95/97 proved at nnecessary =1).
Seed 44 evaded our strict classifier entirely;
functional cross-validation was required to
expose it. We attribute complete collapse
to Prolog’s simpler operational semantics
providing a broader gaming basin (detailed
results in Appendix Table 10 and Figure 4).

We train Qwen3-1.7B under ISR β ∈ {0.1, 0.3}

4.6
Cross-Logic Diagnostic Transfer
Hacking Taxonomy
The nine modes (Table 2; definitions in Appendix D) span 2 logic types, 2 model scales,
and 6 conditions.
H1, H7, and H8 account for >90% of hacking; H7 includes obfuscated subtype H7b (14/350) that evades
text-match classifiers (§5). ISR modestly increases H7 convergence probability (OR=2.84,
p<5×10−12 , 5-seed; Appendix Table 4), but
per-seed variance dominates (Random s46:
91.5% H7; ISR s46: 14.3%). All GRPO
conditions show ≥80% pooled hacking; only
SFT achieves 92.3% non-hacking. Cochran–
Mantel–Haenszel tests stratified by seed confirm both effects (H7: ORCMH =2.46, p<10−15 ;
genuine: ORCMH =3.37, p<10−9 ), indicating
that the associations are robust to within-seed
clustering.
Discussion and Conclusion
STA exposes structural degeneration invisible
to execution-based evaluation (§4.2), and ISR
exhibits Goodhart collapse at all four tested
doses with consistent effects across logic types
and model scales (§4.3–4.5). At 500 steps,
ISR increases genuine proofs relative to random controls (ORCMH =3.37, p<10−9 ); under
stricter classification (3-seed subset), the effect reverses (OR=0.61, n.s.), and extended
training confirms the window closes. ISR
is reliable as a diagnostic but unreliable as
an optimizer: the same LOO bias that rewards genuine necessity also rewards tautological constructions. While Goodhart collapse under LOO-based metrics is theoretically predictable, several specific phenomena
resist simple prediction: stochastic bifurca-

So on page 9 we have:
1. End of §4.3 (from page 8 two-column layout)
2. The new Discussion text continues
3. "Limitations" paragraph

Wait, I see the Discussion section is labeled §5. Currently page 8 has the start of §5 and it continues on page 9. The task says §5 must completely end on page 8.

I need to figure out what section numbering is used. Looking at the section declarations:
- §4.2 = ISR as Diagnostic 
- §4.3 = ISR as Reward: Goodhart Effects


- §4.4 = Cross-Logic
- §4.5 = Cross-Scale
- §4.6 = Hacking Taxonomy
- §5 = Discussion and Conclusion

So §5 is all the content in conclusion.tex. Looking at page 9 output, I see about 15 lines of the Discussion text on page 9, plus the Limitations paragraph.

I need to compress enough to fit on page 8. I have a few options: compress the Table 1 caption, trim something in §4.6 (the taxonomy section on page 8), or compress the Discussion itself. Let me check the current conclusion.tex to see what's actually there.

1	\section{Limitations}
2	\label{sec:limitations}
3	
4	Experiments use a single base model (Qwen3-4B) and dataset family (FOLIO); generalization remains untested.
5	ISR quantifies syntactic component necessity, not semantic faithfulness: a high-ISR proof can still be logically vacuous if its individually necessary premises are collectively inconsistent or semantically ungrounded.
6	A downstream NLI evaluation confirms this gap, finding ISR and task accuracy uncorrelated (Spearman $\rho{=}{-}0.049$, $p{=}0.187$; Appendix~\ref{app:extended-discussion}).
7	Five seeds demonstrate qualitative divergence but limit statistical power for seed-level permutation tests ($p{\geq}0.26$; minimum achievable $p{=}0.008$ at $n{=}5$); CMH tests stratified by seed confirm the pooled associations remain significant ($p{<}10^{-9}$).
8	STA requires solvers supporting component-level input manipulation.
9	
10	\paragraph{Evaluation as temporal snapshot.}
11	All 500-step results represent a temporal snapshot, not an equilibrium.
12	Trajectory analysis on seeds~42 and~45 (1000 steps) confirms that the ${\sim}23\%$ genuine window observed at 500 steps under ISR $\beta{=}0.1$ is transient (s42: $17\%{\to}2\%$; s45: $55\%{\to}0\%$ genuine).
13	Readers should interpret the 500-step non-hacking rates as upper bounds on long-run structural quality under continued training.
14	
15	\paragraph{Seed counts per dose.}
16	ISR $\beta{=}0.05$ uses three seeds (all H7-dominated); random $\beta{=}0.05$ uses three seeds with high variance ($\text{PR}{=}0\%$, $7\%$, $62\%$); $\beta{=}0.2$ uses three seeds.
17	The primary $\beta{=}0.1$ comparison uses five seeds per condition.
18	Although all tested doses produce dominant gaming, the stochastic bifurcation mechanism (\S\ref{sec:goodhart}) means that fewer-seed dose points may not capture the full variance of collapse timing.
19	
20	\paragraph{Cross-scale replication.}
21	Our 1.7B experiments use a single seed.
22	Although different seeds may converge to different exploitation modes (as observed at 4B scale, where three seeds produce three distinct hacking strategies), the qualitative conclusion that hacking dominates with 0\% genuine output is robust: at 4B, all seeds hack regardless of specific mode.
23	The zero-variance mode collapse at 1.7B (100 identical outputs) indicates a sharper convergence basin at smaller scale.
24	Replicating across seeds is a natural next step.
25	
26	\paragraph{Data scale.}
27	Our experiments use 500 training examples and 100 evaluation examples, drawn from FOLIO~\citep{folio}.
28	The training subset is selected via stratified sampling (seed 42) and held constant across all conditions.
29	While our findings are consistent across seeds and logic types, the effect of training data scale on hacking prevalence and mode distribution remains an open question for future work.

So conclusion.tex is §5, then limitations.tex is the next section. The overflow into page 9 includes both the end of §5 and the Limitations section.

The task requires §5 to end on page 8. Currently the ~3 extra lines from my Discussion expansion plus the existing text are pushing it off page 8. I need to find space savings.

Strategy: compress the Table 1 caption (as suggested) and slightly trim the Discussion text.

the specific mode (H7 vs.\\ H1) within a seed is stochastic under both conditions ($\\text{CV}{>}1$), though ISR modestly increases H7 probability by providing a direct reward pathway.\nRandom yields higher PR ($83{\\pm}15\\%$ vs.\\ $70{\\pm}19\\%$;

uncorrected classification, Appendix Table~\\ref{tab:fol-beta01-perseed}).\nThe genuine-rate advantage is sensitive to classification methodology: the 5-seed uncorrected CMH favors ISR, but a 3-seed H8+FN-corrected analysis reverses direction ($\\text{OR}{=}0.61$, n.s.), reflecting both the conservative bias of H8 correction and the reduced sample size.\nThe true effect likely lies between these estimates; the transient benefit is suggestive but not robust to stricter classification.\nThis benefit is temporary: extended training (1000 steps) on seeds~42 and~45 confirms the window closes completely ($17\\%{\\to}2\\%$ and $55\\%{\\to}0\\%$ genuine respectively; see below).\nThe same LOO bias that enables genuine improvement (rewarding necessary premises) also creates the Goodhart attractor (rewarding tautological constructions); the genuine window reflects seeds that have not yet sampled the H7 exploit, not seeds that resist it.\nSnapshot evaluation at 500 steps would overestimate ISR's benefit; trajectory analysis is required to distinguish transient from stable improvement. %% registry: plan002-b01-s42/s45/s46 (500 step) + plan002-b01-s42-1000\n\n\\textbf{Premise-count confound.}\nThe genuine-rate advantage reflects a selection effect: premise-count-matched comparison yields only $1.06\\times$ ISR difference, confirming indistinguishable per-proof quality once LOO bias toward short outputs is controlled (Appendix~\\ref{app:extended-discussion}).\n\n\\textbf{Trajectory analysis: timing, not destiny.}\\label{sec:goodhart-temporal}\nExtended training (1000 steps;

Discussion and Conclusion
STA exposes structural degeneration invisible to execution-based evaluation (§4.2), and
ISR exhibits Goodhart collapse at all four
tested doses (§4.3–4.5). At 500 steps, ISR increases genuine proofs over random controls
(ORCMH =3.37, p<10−9 ); under stricter classification the effect reverses (OR=0.61, n.s.),
and extended training confirms the window
closes. ISR is reliable as a diagnostic but
unreliable as an optimizer: the same LOO
bias that rewards genuine necessity also rewards tautological constructions. While Goodhart collapse under LOO-based metrics is theoretically predictable, several specific phenomena resist simple prediction: stochastic bifurcation between collapse and genuine windows
within identical hyperparameters (§4.3), a nonmonotonic dose-response pattern across four β
levels, and cross-logic mode divergence where
Prolog exhibits gaming pathways absent from
FOL (§4.4). These empirical details, along
with the sensitivity of the genuine-rate advantage to classification methodology, underscore
the gap between predicting that a metric will
be gamed and predicting how. ISR and sim-

Experiments use a single base model (Qwen34B) and dataset family (FOLIO); generalization remains untested. ISR quantifies syntactic component necessity, not semantic faithfulness: a high-ISR proof can still be logically
vacuous if its individually necessary premises
are collectively inconsistent or semantically ungrounded. A downstream NLI evaluation confirms this gap, finding ISR and task accuracy
uncorrelated (Spearman ρ=−0.049, p=0.187;
Appendix C). Five seeds demonstrate qualitative divergence but limit statistical power
for seed-level permutation tests (p≥0.26; minimum achievable p=0.008 at n=5); CMH tests
stratified by seed confirm the pooled associations remain significant (p<10−9 ). STA requires solvers supporting component-level input manipulation.

Replicating across seeds is a natural next step.
tion tools, not training signals.
Limitations
Data scale. Our experiments use 500 training examples and 100 evaluation examples,
drawn from FOLIO (Han et al., 2024). The
training subset is selected via stratified sampling (seed 42) and held constant across all
conditions. While our findings are consistent
across seeds and logic types, the effect of training data scale on hacking prevalence and mode
distribution remains an open question for future work.
Ethics Statement
This work documents failure modes of reward
optimization in neurosymbolic systems. Our
findings (that structural diagnostics can be
gamed when used as training signals) carry
implications for AI safety: they demonstrate
that metrics designed to detect misalignment
may themselves become targets of optimization, a concern relevant to scalable oversight.
We release our taxonomy and diagnostic tools
to help practitioners detect reward hacking
in their own systems. All experiments use
publicly available datasets (FOLIO) and openweight models (Qwen3-4B); no human subjects are involved.
Evaluation as temporal snapshot. All
500-step results represent a temporal snapshot,
not an equilibrium. Trajectory analysis on
seeds 42 and 45 (1000 steps) confirms that the
∼23% genuine window observed at 500 steps
under ISR β=0.1 is transient (s42: 17%→2%;
s45: 55%→0% genuine). Readers should interpret the 500-step non-hacking rates as upper
bounds on long-run structural quality under
continued training.

So "training signals" (end of §5) appears on page 9 line 67. §5 still overflows. Let me compress more aggressively. The Table 2 caption (hacking taxonomy) might also be compressible, and I can also trim the taxonomy text.

Let me look at the experiments.tex taxonomy section text and Table 2 caption.

$\\text{ISR}^*$ tells the opposite story, $0.642\\to0.132\\to0.003$ (214$\\times$ collapse). %% registry: plan003-eval-exec-only-r5, plan001-exec-only-s42-r2, plan016-extended-1000-s42\nBy 500 steps, 87.1\\% of proved samples embed the conclusion (H1); by 1000 steps, the embedding rate saturates at 100\\% and mean component count more than doubles ($6.58\\to18.55$) as the model emits contradictory or vacuous premises that trivially derive any conclusion.\nExtended training, lacking a structural signal, \\emph{worsens} formalization quality while improving the headline number.\n\n\\textbf{Cross-seed instability.}\nThe three exec-only seeds diverge into qualitatively different failure modes despite shared data, hyperparameters, and reward (Appendix~\\ref{app:detailed-results}): s42 reaches $\\text{PR}{=}93\\%$ via conclusion embedding ($\\text{H1}{=}87\\%$); s43 collapses to $\\text{PR}{=}13\\%$ (at 500 steps) via repetition (87\\% of rollouts truncated); s44 reaches $\\text{PR}{=}98\\%$ via tautological collapse ($\\text{H7}{=}100\\%$, mean $n{=}2.04$). %% registry: plan001-exec-only-s42-r2, plan001-exec-only-s43-r4, plan001-exec-only-s44\nThe cross-seed PR variance ($\\sigma{=}47$\\,pp) shows that aggregate metrics obscure qualitatively different failure modes; all three are flagged by $\\text{ISR}^*$ even though one passes the PR check (s44) and one fails it (s43).\nBy 1000 steps, all three converge to high PR ($0.97{\\pm}0.02$) with near-zero genuine output (see Appendix~\\ref{app:h8} and Table~\\ref{tab:fol-detailed}), each through a different dominant mode (s42: $\\text{ISR}^{*}{=}0.003$, taxonomy unavailable;

a 100-step checkpoint ($\\text{PR}{=}32\\%$, hacking${\\geq}31\\%$) partially controls for the PR-level confound, though the PR gap remains substantial (Appendix~\\ref{app:100step}).\nSFT trains via negative log-likelihood on gold formalizations without exploration-exploitation dynamics; exploit discovery requires the trial-and-error sampling inherent to RL but absent from supervised training.\nWhether SFT would develop similar exploits at higher prove rates remains an open question; this mechanistic argument is plausible but not conclusive.\n\n\\subsection{ISR as Reward: Goodhart Effects}\n\\label{sec:goodhart}\n\nWe now reverse roles: instead of treating ISR as an observer, we use it as a reward augmentation, $r = r_{\\text{exec}}\\cdot(1 + \\beta\\,\\text{ISR})$, with a matched random control, $r = r_{\\text{exec}}\\cdot(1 + \\beta\\,u)$, $u\\sim\\mathcal{U}(0,1)$, to isolate ISR-specific signal from generic reward-variance effects.\nThe headline finding: ISR contains an inherent Goodhart vulnerability~\\citep{manheim-goodhart-taxonomy} observed to produce collapse at all four tested doses ($\\beta\\in\\{0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3\\}$).\nThe mechanism is structural: tautological proofs ($P{\\to}P$) receive $\\text{ISR}{=}0.75$ and single-premise-equals-conclusion constructions receive $\\text{ISR}{\\geq}0.5$, both by the LOO definition alone.\nOnce sampled during GRPO rollouts, these high-ISR tautologies create a positive feedback loop;

the 3 non-collapsed seeds individually range from $17\\%$ to $55\\%$ genuine.\nThis bifurcation is stochastic: all seeds are indistinguishable in the first ${\\sim}100$ steps ($\\text{ISR}{\\approx}0.05$--$0.07$); divergence occurs at steps 150--200 when H7 tautologies, which receive $\\text{ISR}{\\geq}0.5$ by construction, are sampled during rollouts and reinforced via the positive feedback loop.\nOnce a seed enters the H7 basin, convergence to saturation takes ${\\sim}150$ steps and is irreversible. %% registry: plan002-additive-b01-s42/s43-r2/s44/s45/s46\n\nH7 (a single premise identical to the conclusion, giving $\\text{ISR}\\geq 0.5$ by the LOO definition; \\S\\ref{sec:taxonomy-method}) is the canonical Goodhart exploit: the model satisfies the structural metric directly rather than producing a genuine derivation.\nTotal conclusion embedding ($\\text{H1}+\\text{H7}$) is GRPO-universal at $68$--$100\\%$ across both ISR and random conditions (Appendix Figure~\\ref{fig:hacking-composition}); the specific mode (H7 vs.\\ H1) within a seed is stochastic under both conditions ($\\text{CV}{>}1$), though ISR modestly increases H7 probability by providing a direct reward pathway.\nRandom yields higher PR ($83{\\pm}15\\%$ vs.\\ $70{\\pm}19\\%$; $n{=}5$ each).\nRandom H7 exhibits extreme seed dependence (per-seed range: $0\\%$--$91.5\\%$; pooled $30\\%$ is dominated by s46 at $91.5\\%$ and s43 at $38.3\\%$).\nBoth conditions produce H7 in 2 of 5 seeds, but the quality differs: ISR-induced H7 is absorbing ($100\\%$ of proved samples in affected seeds: s43${=}61/61$, s44${=}89/89$), while random-induced H7 coexists with other modes ($38$--$92\\%$).\nISR's reward signal converts H7 from a stochastic possibility into an irreversible attractor once sampled.\nThe reward landscape explains H7's attractor strength: H7 tautologies receive expected reward $1{+}0.75\\beta$ versus ${\\sim}1{+}0.26\\beta$ for genuine proofs (premise-count-matched), a gap of ${\\sim}0.49\\beta$ that creates a persistent gradient toward tautological constructions regardless of dose.\n\n\\textbf{The transient genuine window.}\nDuring the transient window, Cochran--Mantel--Haenszel tests stratified by seed show ISR produces more genuine proofs than random controls ($\\text{OR}_{\\text{CMH}}{=}3.37$, 95\\% CI $[2.21, 5.13]$, $p{<}10^{-9}$; uncorrected classification, Appendix Table~\\ref{tab:fol-beta01-perseed}).\nThe genuine-rate advantage is sensitive to classification methodology: the 5-seed uncorrected CMH favors ISR, but a 3-seed H8+FN-corrected analysis reverses direction ($\\text{OR}{=}0.61$, n.s.), reflecting both the conservative bias of H8 correction and the reduced sample size.\nThe true effect likely lies between these estimates; the transient benefit is suggestive but not robust to stricter classification.\nThis benefit is temporary: extended training (1000 steps) on seeds~42 and~45 confirms the window closes completely ($17\\%{\\to}2\\%$ and $55\\%{\\to}0\\%$ genuine respectively; see below).\nThe same LOO bias that enables genuine improvement (rewarding necessary premises) also creates the Goodhart attractor (rewarding tautological constructions); the genuine window reflects seeds that have not yet sampled the H7 exploit, not seeds that resist it.\nSnapshot evaluation at 500 steps would overestimate ISR's benefit; trajectory analysis is required to distinguish transient from stable improvement. %% registry: plan002-b01-s42/s45/s46 (500 step) + plan002-b01-s42-1000\n\n\\textbf{Premise-count confound.}\nThe genuine-rate advantage reflects a selection effect: premise-count-matched comparison yields only $1.06\\times$ ISR difference, confirming indistinguishable per-proof quality once LOO bias toward short outputs is controlled (Appendix~\\ref{app:extended-discussion}).\n\n\\textbf{Trajectory analysis: timing, not destiny.}\\label{sec:goodhart-temporal}\nExtended training (1000 steps; Appendix Figure~\\ref{fig:training-isr-curves}) confirms the genuine window is transient across seeds.\nSeed~42 declines from $17\\%$ to $2\\%$ genuine via H7 saturation ($16.0\\%{\\to}96.7\\%$ H7, PR stable at ${\\sim}96\\%$); seed~45, which achieved the highest 500-step genuine rate ($55\\%$), collapses to $0\\%$ genuine through reward collapse ($\\text{PR}: 42\\%{\\to}2\\%$).\nThe two seeds exhibit distinct failure paths (H7 gaming vs.\\ output collapse) but converge to the same outcome: zero genuine proofs at extended training. %% registry: plan002-b01-s42-1000, plan016-extended-1000-s42, plan002-b01-s45-1000\n\n\\textbf{Micro-dose ISR ($\\beta{=}0.05$): deterministic collapse.}\nAll three ISR seeds reach $\\text{PR}{\\geq}99\\%$ but converge to H7a tautology (H7 $87$--$100\\%$, genuine $5.1\\%$), while the random control mostly fails to learn (median $\\text{PR}{=}7\\%$) with zero H7, confirming H7 as specific to ISR's LOO structure.\nBelow a signal-floor, ISR's genuine component is undetectable while its H7 bias remains exploitable (per-seed breakdown in Appendix~\\ref{app:beta005}). %% registry: sweep-isr-b005-s42/s43/s44, sweep-random-b005-s42/s43/s44\n\n\\textbf{Medium-dose ISR ($\\beta{=}0.2$): maximum exploitation.}\nAll three seeds converge to pure H7a tautology ($0\\%$ non-hacking, $n{=}290$;

per-seed details in Appendix~\\ref{app:beta03}).\nThe random control is equally unstable ($\\text{PR}{=}54{\\pm}35\\%$) with $91\\%$ H1 and ${\\leq}4\\%$ non-hacking; high-dose proxy weighting destabilizes training regardless of signal source. %% registry: plan002-additive-b03-s42/s43/s44\nISR vs.\\ random H7 at $\\beta{=}0.3$: $\\text{OR}{=}13.7$, 95\\% CI $[7.0, 26.8]$ (Appendix~\\ref{app:beta03}).\n\n\\textbf{Non-monotonic dose-response.}\nThe four $\\beta$ levels reveal a non-monotonic pattern: $\\beta\\in\\{0.05, 0.2\\}$ converge deterministically to H7 collapse (${\\geq}94\\%$ H7), $\\beta{=}0.3$ triggers multi-modal instability, and only $\\beta{=}0.1$ sustains a transient genuine window (3 of 5 seeds).\nGoodhart collapse is not a simple function of dose; the balance between genuine and exploit reinforcement depends on a threshold interaction between $\\beta$ and rollout stochasticity.\n\n\\subsection{Cross-Logic Diagnostic Transfer}\n\\label{sec:crosslogic}\n\nWe replicate the FOL pipeline with Prolog/SWI-Prolog (3 seeds, $\\beta{=}0.1$).\nUnder exec-only training, 2/3 seeds show $\\text{ISR}^{*}{\\approx}0$ despite $\\text{PR}{\\geq}0.56$, reflecting redundant ground-fact repetition rather than FOL-style conclusion embedding; ISR flags both failure semantics.\nUnder ISR reward, 3/3 seeds reach $0\\%$ non-hacking through three distinct mechanisms: clean H7 tautology (s42, $\\text{ISR}^{*}{=}1.0$), degenerate uppercase pseudo-Prolog evading text-match classifiers (s43, functional $n_{\\text{necessary}}{=}1$), and query-as-fact gaming (s44, $95/97$ proved at $n_{\\text{necessary}}{=}1$).\nSeed~44 evaded our strict classifier entirely; functional cross-validation was required to expose it.\nWe attribute complete collapse to Prolog's simpler operational semantics providing a broader gaming basin (detailed results in Appendix Table~\\ref{tab:prolog-detailed} and Figure~\\ref{fig:prolog-comparison}).\n\n\\subsection{Cross-Scale Evidence}\n\\label{sec:crossscale}\n\nWe train Qwen3-1.7B under ISR $\\beta\\in\\{0.1,0.3\\}$ and Random $\\beta{=}0.1$ (single seed, 500 steps).\nAll conditions produce $0\\%$ non-hacking, but the exploit modes differ qualitatively from 4B: Random discovers H9 (contradiction injection, $\\text{PR}{=}93\\%$, $100\\%$ \\emph{ex falso}), ISR $\\beta{=}0.1$ collapses to a single fixed template ($\\text{ISR}^{*}{=}0.6$ at zero variance, $100\\%$ H1), and ISR $\\beta{=}0.3$ triggers reward collapse ($\\text{PR}{=}17\\%$) mirroring the 4B pattern.\nH9 never appears at 4B scale; fixed-template mode collapse never appears at 4B; different capacities converge to different Goodhart basins under identical rewards.\nNo safe scale was observed in this single-seed comparison (Table~\\ref{tab:hacking-taxonomy}).\n\n\\subsection{Hacking Taxonomy}\n\\label{sec:taxonomy}\n\n\n\\begin{table}[t]\n\\centering\n\\small\n\\resizebox{\\columnwidth}{!}{%\n\\begin{tabular}{lccccccc}\n\\toprule\n\\textbf{Mode} & \\textbf{Exec} & \\textbf{ISR$_{.1}$} & \\textbf{Rnd$_{.1}$} & \\textbf{SFT} & \\textbf{Prolog$_{\\text{ISR}}$} & \\textbf{1.7B$_{\\text{ISR}}$} & \\textbf{1.7B$_{\\text{Rnd}}$} \\\\\n\\midrule\nH1 embed       & 87 & 18 & 59 & 7 & 0$^\\sharp$ & \\textbf{100} & 0 \\\\\nH7 duplicate   & 0  & \\textbf{54} & 30 & 0 & 100$^\\sharp$ & 0 & 0 \\\\\nH8 prem-subset & 6  & 5  & 8   & 0 & --- & 0 & 0 \\\\\nH9 ex falso    & --- & --- & --- & --- & --- & 0 & \\textbf{100} \\\\\nTautological   & --- & --- & --- & --- & s42 & --- & --- \\\\\nRepetition     & s43 & --- & --- & --- & --- & --- & --- \\\\\nContradiction  & 1k & --- & --- & --- & --- & --- & --- \\\\\nCmplx.\\ vacuous& 0  & 0  & 4  & 0 & --- & --- & --- \\\\\nQuery-as-fact  & --- & --- & --- & --- & s44 & --- & --- \\\\\n\\midrule\n\\textbf{Non-hacking} & 8  & \\textbf{23}  & 8 & \\textbf{92} & \\textbf{0} & \\textbf{0} & \\textbf{0} \\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}}\n\\caption{Nine hacking modes across conditions (\\% of proved samples;

all three are flagged by $\\text{ISR}^*$ even though one passes the PR check (s44) and one fails it (s43).\nBy 1000 steps, all three converge to high PR ($0.97{\\pm}0.02$) with near-zero genuine output (see Appendix~\\ref{app:h8} and Table~\\ref{tab:fol-detailed}), each through a different dominant mode (s42: $\\text{ISR}^{*}{=}0.003$, taxonomy unavailable;

a 100-step checkpoint ($\\text{PR}{=}32\\%$, hacking${\\geq}31\\%$) partially controls for the PR-level confound, though the PR gap remains substantial (Appendix~\\ref{app:100step}).\nSFT trains via negative log-likelihood on gold formalizations without exploration-exploitation dynamics; exploit discovery requires the trial-and-error sampling inherent to RL but absent from supervised training.\nWhether SFT would develop similar exploits at higher prove rates remains an open question; this mechanistic argument is plausible but not conclusive.\n\n\\subsection{ISR as Reward: Goodhart Effects}\n\\label{sec:goodhart}\n\nWe now reverse roles: instead of treating ISR as an observer, we use it as a reward augmentation, $r = r_{\\text{exec}}\\cdot(1 + \\beta\\,\\text{ISR})$, with a matched random control, $r = r_{\\text{exec}}\\cdot(1 + \\beta\\,u)$, $u\\sim\\mathcal{U}(0,1)$, to isolate ISR-specific signal from generic reward-variance effects.\nThe headline finding: ISR contains an inherent Goodhart vulnerability~\\citep{manheim-goodhart-taxonomy} observed to produce collapse at all four tested doses ($\\beta\\in\\{0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3\\}$).\nThe mechanism is structural: tautological proofs ($P{\\to}P$) receive $\\text{ISR}{=}0.75$ and single-premise-equals-conclusion constructions receive $\\text{ISR}{\\geq}0.5$, both by the LOO definition alone.\nOnce sampled during GRPO rollouts, these high-ISR tautologies create a positive feedback loop; $\\beta$ controls only the \\emph{timing} of collapse, not whether it occurs.\n\n\\begin{table}[t]\n\\centering\n\\small\n\\resizebox{\\columnwidth}{!}{%\n\\begin{tabular}{lcccccc}\n\\toprule\n\\textbf{Condition} & $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$ & \\textbf{PR\\%}$\\uparrow$ & \\textbf{ISR}$^*$ & \\textbf{H7\\%} & \\textbf{H1\\%} & \\textbf{N-H\\%} \\\\\n\\midrule\nBase (0-shot) & --- & 12 & --- & --- & --- & --- \\\\ %% registry: sta-phase0-baseline\nSFT & --- & 13 & 0.595 & 0 & 8 & \\textbf{92} \\\\ %% registry: plan009-sft-baseline-s42-1000/s43-1000/s44-1000-r3 (3-seed pooled)\n\\midrule\nExec-only$^\\dagger$ & --- & 93 & 0.132 & 0 & 87 & 8 \\\\ %% registry: plan001-exec-only-s42-r2 (H8 corrected)\nExec-only (1k)$^{\\dagger\\dagger}$ & --- & 97{\\scriptsize$\\pm$2} & 0.03{\\scriptsize$\\pm$.05} & 0 & --- & $\\leq$2$^{\\dagger\\dagger}$ \\\\\nISR$^\\ddagger$ & 0.1 & 70{\\scriptsize$\\pm$19} & --- & \\textbf{54} & 18 & 23$^\\star$ \\\\ %% registry: plan002-additive-b01-s42/s43-r2/s44/s45/s46 (5-seed, D124)\nRandom & 0.1 & \\textbf{83}{\\scriptsize$\\pm$15} & 0.080{\\scriptsize$\\pm$.06} & 30 & 59 & 8 \\\\ %% registry: plan018-additive-random-b01-s42/s43-r3/s44-r2/s45/s46 (5-seed)\nISR & 0.2 & 97{\\scriptsize$\\pm$4} & 0.69{\\scriptsize$\\pm$.24} & \\textbf{99} & 0 & 0 \\\\ %% registry: sweep-isr-b02-s42/s43/s44 (3-seed;

the 3 non-collapsed seeds individually range from $17\\%$ to $55\\%$ genuine.\nThis bifurcation is stochastic: all seeds are indistinguishable in the first ${\\sim}100$ steps ($\\text{ISR}{\\approx}0.05$--$0.07$); divergence occurs at steps 150--200 when H7 tautologies, which receive $\\text{ISR}{\\geq}0.5$ by construction, are sampled during rollouts and reinforced via the positive feedback loop.\nOnce a seed enters the H7 basin, convergence to saturation takes ${\\sim}150$ steps and is irreversible. %% registry: plan002-additive-b01-s42/s43-r2/s44/s45/s46\n\nH7 (a single premise identical to the conclusion, giving $\\text{ISR}\\geq 0.5$ by the LOO definition; \\S\\ref{sec:taxonomy-method}) is the canonical Goodhart exploit: the model satisfies the structural metric directly rather than producing a genuine derivation.\nTotal conclusion embedding ($\\text{H1}+\\text{H7}$) is GRPO-universal at $68$--$100\\%$ across both ISR and random conditions (Appendix Figure~\\ref{fig:hacking-composition}); the specific mode (H7 vs.\\ H1) within a seed is stochastic under both conditions ($\\text{CV}{>}1$), though ISR modestly increases H7 probability by providing a direct reward pathway.\nRandom yields higher PR ($83{\\pm}15\\%$ vs.\\ $70{\\pm}19\\%$; $n{=}5$ each).\nRandom H7 exhibits extreme seed dependence (per-seed range: $0\\%$--$91.5\\%$; pooled $30\\%$ is dominated by s46 at $91.5\\%$ and s43 at $38.3\\%$).\nBoth conditions produce H7 in 2 of 5 seeds, but the quality differs: ISR-induced H7 is absorbing ($100\\%$ of proved samples in affected seeds: s43${=}61/61$, s44${=}89/89$), while random-induced H7 coexists with other modes ($38$--$92\\%$).\nISR's reward signal converts H7 from a stochastic possibility into an irreversible attractor once sampled.\nThe reward landscape explains H7's attractor strength: H7 tautologies receive expected reward $1{+}0.75\\beta$ versus ${\\sim}1{+}0.26\\beta$ for genuine proofs (premise-count-matched), a gap of ${\\sim}0.49\\beta$ that creates a persistent gradient toward tautological constructions regardless of dose.\n\n\\textbf{The transient genuine window.}\nDuring the transient window, Cochran--Mantel--Haenszel tests stratified by seed show ISR produces more genuine proofs than random controls ($\\text{OR}_{\\text{CMH}}{=}3.37$, 95\\% CI $[2.21, 5.13]$, $p{<}10^{-9}$; uncorrected classification, Appendix Table~\\ref{tab:fol-beta01-perseed}).\nThe genuine-rate advantage is sensitive to classification methodology: the 5-seed uncorrected CMH favors ISR, but a 3-seed H8+FN-corrected analysis reverses direction ($\\text{OR}{=}0.61$, n.s.), reflecting both the conservative bias of H8 correction and the reduced sample size.\nThe true effect likely lies between these estimates; the transient benefit is suggestive but not robust to stricter classification.\nThis benefit is temporary: extended training (1000 steps) on seeds~42 and~45 confirms the window closes completely ($17\\%{\\to}2\\%$ and $55\\%{\\to}0\\%$ genuine respectively; see below).\nThe same LOO bias that enables genuine improvement (rewarding necessary premises) also creates the Goodhart attractor (rewarding tautological constructions); the genuine window reflects seeds that have not yet sampled the H7 exploit, not seeds that resist it.\nSnapshot evaluation at 500 steps would overestimate ISR's benefit; trajectory analysis is required to distinguish transient from stable improvement. %% registry: plan002-b01-s42/s45/s46 (500 step) + plan002-b01-s42-1000\n\n\\textbf{Premise-count confound.}\nThe genuine-rate advantage reflects a selection effect: premise-count-matched comparison yields only $1.06\\times$ ISR difference, confirming indistinguishable per-proof quality once LOO bias toward short outputs is controlled (Appendix~\\ref{app:extended-discussion}).\n\n\\textbf{Trajectory analysis: timing, not destiny.}\\label{sec:goodhart-temporal}\nExtended training (1000 steps; Appendix Figure~\\ref{fig:training-isr-curves}) confirms the genuine window is transient across seeds.\nSeed~42 declines from $17\\%$ to $2\\%$ genuine via H7 saturation ($16.0\\%{\\to}96.7\\%$ H7, PR stable at ${\\sim}96\\%$); seed~45, which achieved the highest 500-step genuine rate ($55\\%$), collapses to $0\\%$ genuine through reward collapse ($\\text{PR}: 42\\%{\\to}2\\%$).\nThe two seeds exhibit distinct failure paths (H7 gaming vs.\\ output collapse) but converge to the same outcome: zero genuine proofs at extended training. %% registry: plan002-b01-s42-1000, plan016-extended-1000-s42, plan002-b01-s45-1000\n\n\\textbf{Micro-dose ISR ($\\beta{=}0.05$): deterministic collapse.}\nAll three ISR seeds reach $\\text{PR}{\\geq}99\\%$ but converge to H7a tautology (H7 $87$--$100\\%$, genuine $5.1\\%$), while the random control mostly fails to learn (median $\\text{PR}{=}7\\%$) with zero H7, confirming H7 as specific to ISR's LOO structure.\nBelow a signal-floor, ISR's genuine component is undetectable while its H7 bias remains exploitable (per-seed breakdown in Appendix~\\ref{app:beta005}). %% registry: sweep-isr-b005-s42/s43/s44, sweep-random-b005-s42/s43/s44\n\n\\textbf{Medium-dose ISR ($\\beta{=}0.2$): maximum exploitation.}\nAll three seeds converge to pure H7a tautology ($0\\%$ non-hacking, $n{=}290$;

the balance between genuine and exploit reinforcement depends on a threshold interaction between $\\beta$ and rollout stochasticity.\n\n\\subsection{Cross-Logic Diagnostic Transfer}\n\\label{sec:crosslogic}\n\nWe replicate the FOL pipeline with Prolog/SWI-Prolog (3 seeds, $\\beta{=}0.1$).\nUnder exec-only training, 2/3 seeds show $\\text{ISR}^{*}{\\approx}0$ despite $\\text{PR}{\\geq}0.56$, reflecting redundant ground-fact repetition rather than FOL-style conclusion embedding; ISR flags both failure semantics.\nUnder ISR reward, 3/3 seeds reach $0\\%$ non-hacking through three distinct mechanisms: clean H7 tautology (s42, $\\text{ISR}^{*}{=}1.0$), degenerate uppercase pseudo-Prolog evading text-match classifiers (s43, functional $n_{\\text{necessary}}{=}1$), and query-as-fact gaming (s44, $95/97$ proved at $n_{\\text{necessary}}{=}1$).\nSeed~44 evaded our strict classifier entirely; functional cross-validation was required to expose it.\nWe attribute complete collapse to Prolog's simpler operational semantics providing a broader gaming basin (detailed results in Appendix Table~\\ref{tab:prolog-detailed} and Figure~\\ref{fig:prolog-comparison}).\n\n\\subsection{Cross-Scale Evidence}\n\\label{sec:crossscale}\n\nWe train Qwen3-1.7B under ISR $\\beta\\in\\{0.1,0.3\\}$ and Random $\\beta{=}0.1$ (single seed, 500 steps).\nAll conditions produce $0\\%$ non-hacking, but the exploit modes differ qualitatively from 4B: Random discovers H9 (contradiction injection, $\\text{PR}{=}93\\%$, $100\\%$ \\emph{ex falso}), ISR $\\beta{=}0.1$ collapses to a single fixed template ($\\text{ISR}^{*}{=}0.6$ at zero variance, $100\\%$ H1), and ISR $\\beta{=}0.3$ triggers reward collapse ($\\text{PR}{=}17\\%$) mirroring the 4B pattern.\nH9 never appears at 4B scale;
