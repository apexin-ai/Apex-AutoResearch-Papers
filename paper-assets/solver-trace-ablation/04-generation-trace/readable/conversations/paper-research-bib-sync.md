## Record overview

- **Events:** 11
- **Recorded user turns:** 0
- **Tool calls:** 5
- **Original source:** `logs/chats/worker_paper_research_bib_sync_20260514T183047.jsonl`

## How to read this transcript

`User` marks a recorded user-role instruction, `Assistant` marks an agent response, and the collapsible `Tool call` / `Tool result` blocks show the actions and observations between them. A user-role record may come from another agent or the runtime system; it is not an authorship label.
