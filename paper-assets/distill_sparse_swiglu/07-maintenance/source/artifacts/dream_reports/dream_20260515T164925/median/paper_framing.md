# Paper Framing — distill_sparse_swiglu

## Target Venue
- Primary: EMNLP 2026 Main (ARR May 2026 cycle)
- Deadline: 2026-05-25 (ARR submission)
- Track: Efficient Methods for NLP

## Core Claims

1. **KL-trained sparsity predictors eliminate the need for error compensation networks**: At 50% model-level sparsity on SwiGLU LLMs, a KL-trained contextual predictor (no compensation) matches or exceeds BCE+compensation quality (FastForward-style), eliminating ~256MB of inference-time compensation weights and per-layer GEMV overhead. (Headline claim)

2. **Static and contextual corrections compose additively**: SPON's input-independent bias correction (average-case drift) and KL-trained contextual prediction (per-input variation) provide additive quality recovery. Formalized as modular decomposition c = c_s + c_theta(x) where output-space interaction is negligible.

3. **KL advantage scales quadratically with sparsity**: BCE's per-neuron factorized gradient (mean-field analog) misses joint neuron interactions scaling as O(s^2 D^2). Testable prediction: KL-vs-BCE delta follows approximately quadratic curve in sparsity level s.

## Story Spine

- **Problem**: SwiGLU activation sparsity enables 40-60% neuron pruning at inference, but training-free heuristics (WINA/TEAL) leave a 6+ point quality gap, while learned BCE predictors require auxiliary compensation networks adding ~256MB overhead (FastForward).

- **Existing approaches & gaps**: (a) Training-free (WINA, TEAL, R-Sparse): no training cost, but quality gap too large for deployment. (b) Static learned (SPON): zero-overhead bias correction via KL distillation, but input-independent — cannot adapt to per-input neuron importance. (c) Contextual learned (FastForward): BCE predictor + compensation MLP, near-dense quality but inference overhead from compensation network. Gap: no prior work trains the contextual predictor itself with KL, and no work tests SPON + contextual composition.

- **Our framing / headline question**: "Does output-distribution distillation (KL) make error compensation unnecessary for contextual sparsity prediction?" The theoretical grounding: BCE gradient dL_BCE/ds_j depends only on neuron j (factorized), while KL gradient dL_KL/ds_j couples all active neurons through d_logits/dh * dh/dm — a mathematical property of the gradient structure, not an analogy. This means KL captures joint interaction effects that BCE misses, especially at high sparsity.

- **Headline result template**: "On [benchmarks], a KL-trained predictor at 50% model-level sparsity achieves [X] quality (within [Y]% of dense) without compensation, while BCE+compensation achieves [Z] — demonstrating that output-distribution distillation subsumes error compensation and enabling a simpler, lighter inference pipeline."

## Two-Dimensional Taxonomy (Conceptual Contribution)

|                          | Decomposed (BCE) | Intermediate (MSE) | Coupled (KL) |
|--------------------------|:-----------------:|:-------------------:|:-------------:|
| Static                   | —                 | —                   | SPON          |
| Per-layer                | —                 | ShadowLLM           | —             |
| Per-token contextual     | FastForward       | —                   | **Ours**      |

Positions prior work and ours on two axes: correction granularity (static -> per-token) x training signal coupling (decomposed/BCE -> coupled/KL). Highlights the empty cell we fill.

## Anticipated Reviewer Concerns

1. **"Incremental / no new algorithm"**: Mitigate with formal decomposition framework, quantitative s^2 prediction, and comprehensive four-quadrant outcome analysis showing all results are informative.

2. **"KL wins only because more compute"**: Addressed by iso-compute ablation (plan_003) giving BCE equivalent total FLOPs via extended training.

3. **"Gumbel-sigmoid relaxation, not KL, explains gains"**: Addressed by STE baseline (plan_002) isolating loss function contribution.

4. **"Single model / limited generalization"**: Addressed by Mistral-7B-v0.3 validation (plan_009) with different architecture (GQA + sliding window).

5. **"Effect size may not hold on downstream tasks"**: Full benchmark suite (PPL + 5 discriminative + LongBench + MT-Bench) covers all axes.

## Venue Fit
- EMNLP Efficient Methods track: strong fit for activation sparsity + distillation
- NLP-specific evaluation (LongBench long-context, MT-Bench multi-turn) strengthens EMNLP fit vs pure systems venue
- Novelty ceiling acknowledged: contribution is systematic composition + rigorous ablation, not new architecture
