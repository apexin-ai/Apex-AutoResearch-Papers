## Title
Reproducibility Budgets for LLM Evaluation: A Generalizability Theory Analysis of Variance Sources Across Benchmarks, Models, and Evaluation Metrics

## Core Claims (3 条，可证伪)

**Claim 1 — Format-Associated Item-Related Variance Concentration**: LLM evaluation variance structure shows a format-associated pattern. We define **item-related variance** = item main effect + model×item interaction (DIF: differential item functioning — model-specific item difficulty). MC benchmarks concentrate item-related variance: MMLU 68.1%, ARC 71.6%, HellaSwag 70.3% (all >67%). FF benchmarks disperse it: GSM8K 31.5%, MATH 41.3% (all <42%). Gap 26.8pp with no overlap across all 5 benchmarks. The mechanism is item difficulty heterogeneity: within MMLU's 57 subjects, subjects with higher item difficulty dispersion show higher item variance (ρ=0.806, p=0.005). This structural difference implies different optimization strategies but does NOT predict item budgets — 8-model n(G≥0.80): ARC(MC) 98 < MATH(FF) 101 < HellaSwag(MC) 118 < GSM8K(FF) 128, MC/FF completely interleaved. Cohen's d=1.73 (n=5, permutation p=0.10 = mathematical floor for C(5,3)=10 partitions — report as observed pattern, not statistical conclusion).
**Reframing rationale (D017)**: Previous "item dominates in MC" fails for HellaSwag (item 34.3% < m×i 36.0%). R1 suggested aggregating item+m×i as "item-related" — psychometrically justified via DIF literature (Brennan 2001 Ch.4, Embretson & Reise 2000). Must front-load this definition in Method section as original design concept, not reactive patch.
**Three-level narrative**: (1) item-related variance CONCENTRATION is format-associated (observed pattern, strong descriptive evidence); (2) optimization STRATEGY differs by format (inference); (3) item BUDGET is NOT format-associated (don't claim).
**Cross-model finding (exp-001)**: Item_id drops from 61% (single-model) to 42% (cross-model) as model×item (34%) absorbs model-conditional difficulty. Item difficulty rankings are model-specific — single-model G-studies overestimate item dominance by conflating universal and model-specific difficulty.
**Cross-benchmark finding (exp-004, 8 models × 5 benchmarks, 2,304,000 records)**: MC benchmarks internally consistent (item_id 34-38%), FF benchmarks lower (17-24%). MMLU and ARC converge to identical 37.88% at 8 models. The structural shift is between evaluation formats; within-MMLU gradient (ρ=0.806) confirms item heterogeneity as mechanism.
**Empirical anchors (exp-001, 4 models, balanced bf16, 345,600 records)**: Single-model item_id=61.1%, cross-model item_id=42.1% [36.0-48.8%] (↓19pp), model×item=33.6% [28.4-37.9%] (second-largest source, increased from 3-model 31.7%). G_item=0.820 [0.782-0.861]. D-study prediction validated out-of-sample: 3-model predicted G=0.816 for n=4, actual=0.820 (Δ=0.004). Forward projection: 5 models → G=0.848, 8→0.893, 10→0.910 (G≥0.90 requires ~10 models). Residual dropped 24%→19.5% as 4th model split residual into model×item. Per-model interaction: Mistral 29.25% (lowest accuracy 63.8%) > Qwen 27.11% > Gemma 23.95% > Llama 19.69%.
**REML robustness**: REML-EM (500 iter, practical convergence Δ<0.003pp) confirms Henderson I: all components differ <0.5pp. Henderson I unbiased for balanced designs. Dataset B differences (item_id 38→52%, model×item 26→12%) due to design differences (factor selection), not estimator bias — measurement design choices themselves affect observed variance structure.
**Completed robustness**: BF16-vs-FP16 sensitivity confirms precision→0.0006% without FP32 (FP32 is sole source of precision variance); leave-one-model-out (matched-spec) shows G_item range 0.747-0.793 across 3-model subsets (spread=0.046) — all below 0.80, confirming 4 models is the minimum for reliable cross-model measurement. LOMO also confirms item_id dominance and model×item as second-largest source are stable across all subsets.
**GLMM cross-check (dual-analysis, must report both)**: Two complementary analyses:
(i) *Marginal logit ANOVA*: All 7 grouped component rankings preserved exactly (ρ=1.0), consistent with MQL-1 prediction that logit-scaling is approximately constant at p̄=0.70.
(ii) *VB GLMM (25-item subsample)*: Ranking reversal on top-2 — model:item_id=47.3% > item_id=22.8% on logit scale (ρ=0.571, p=0.18). Attributable to model underspecification (missing 4 item-interaction terms in VB model) + subsample.
**Paper must present BOTH honestly** — "marginal logit ANOVA preserves all rankings; VB GLMM shows differences attributable to model underspecification." Do NOT overwrite ρ=0.571 with ρ=1.0. Implication: model×item interaction may be even more important than Henderson I indicates on logit scale — strengthens Claim 1's core message.

**Claim 2 — Conditional Separability**: Infrastructure factors (numerical precision) and methodology factors (prompt, seed, temperature, ordering) are approximately separable at the aggregate level — direct infrastructure×methodology interaction ≈0% under binary scoring; the only detectable cross-factor interaction (precision×temperature=1.3%) emerges under text-exact-match scoring, consistent with floating-point non-associativity (Messina & Scotta, 2026). Both factor types interact substantially with item difficulty (precision×item, prompt×item), making their effects item-conditional. This provides a metric-qualified confirmatory finding for isolated-factor studies while warning that conclusions are conditional on item selection and evaluation metric. Note: with only numerical precision tested on a single GPU architecture (pending exp-003 for hardware crossing), "infrastructure" is currently limited to the precision facet.

**Claim 3 — Design-Dependent Reproducibility Budget**: Reproducibility budgets are fundamentally design-dependent. The critical insight: the number of items needed for reliable measurement depends dramatically on how many evaluation conditions you use.
- **Multi-facet design** (8 models × 6 prompts × 6 seeds × 2 temps × 4 orderings = 1,296 conditions/item): G=0.936 at 200 items, G≥0.80 at only **55 items**.
- **Single-condition evaluation** (1×1×1×1, typical practice): G=0.592 at 200 items, G≥0.80 requires **552 items**.
- **Partial design** (4 conditions): G≥0.80 requires **245 items** (4.5× multi-facet).
- **IRT's 116-item recommendation** yields G=0.457 under single-condition — far below the 0.80 reliability threshold. IRT ignores prompt, seed, and ordering facets entirely.
The **10.0× efficiency gap** between multi-facet (55 items) and single-condition (552 items) is the core practical contribution: G-theory shows that **investing in evaluation conditions is more efficient than adding items** when prompt/seed/ordering facets contribute substantial variance.

## Contributions (restructured per review: 2 core + 2 auxiliary)

### Core Contributions

1. **Format-associated item-related variance concentration + item heterogeneity mechanism**: In a crossed 8-model × 5-benchmark design (2,304,000 records), item-related variance (item + model×item DIF) concentrates in MC benchmarks (68-72%) and disperses in FF benchmarks (31-41%), with no overlap across all 5 benchmarks. G_item is uniformly high across all formats (0.86-0.90 with multi-facet formula). The mechanism is item difficulty heterogeneity: within-MMLU gradient shows ρ=0.806 (p=0.005) between std(p_i) and item variance share. [Note: contribution is the format-associated concentration pattern + mechanism identification. "item-related" aggregation justified by DIF literature (Brennan 2001, Embretson & Reise 2000). Model×item = differential item functioning, operationally an item property. Must NOT use "hidden" — model×item known in IRT literature.]

2. **Design-dependent reproducibility budgets via D-study**: The first empirical quantification of how evaluation design choices affect measurement reliability in LLM evaluation. Single-condition evaluation (typical practice) requires **552 items** for G≥0.80; a multi-facet design reduces this to **55 items** — an approximately **10× efficiency gain** from condition averaging (bootstrap CI pending). G-theory's D-study reveals this tradeoff explicitly: investing in evaluation conditions is more efficient than adding items. The practical implication: current evaluation practices (1 prompt, 1 seed, ~200 items) achieve G=0.592 — the field is in a reliability gap it cannot see without multi-facet analysis. [Note: IRT comparison is illustrative only (different optimization objectives); label explicitly as such.]

### Auxiliary Findings

3. **Precision separability (confirmatory)**: BF16/FP16 interchangeable under binary scoring (<0.1% interaction). Confirmatory null result with direct practical value for evaluation practitioners. [Demoted from core contribution per reviewer consensus.]

4. **Practitioner toolkit**: Open-source G-theory variance decomposition pipeline + D-study budget calculator for LLM evaluation.

## Methodological Robustness Package (6 验证分析)
All completed on Llama 239,200 records:
- **Binary data not artifact**: Null simulation item_id=0.08% vs observed 61.1% (737.5×); obs/Bernoulli ratio=1.0008
- **Fixed vs random insensitive**: G_item difference only 0.37pp (all-random 0.820 vs fixed temp+ordering 0.824); facet classification near-insensitive
- **Bootstrap = jackknife**: CI width ratio 0.96-1.04, independence violation negligible
- **Temperature stratification**: Binary G degrades T=0.0 (0.760) → T=0.7 (0.549); text metric unreliable at all T>0
- **D-study formula verified (8-model, Henderson I)**: Multi-facet min_items_G80=55, single-condition min_items_G80=552, ratio **10.0×**. G@200: multi-facet 0.936, single-condition 0.592. Progressive validation: ratio stable across 4-model (8.8×) and 8-model (10.0×) designs. Paper reports 10.0× as the 8-model definitive result.
- **IRT comparison (8-model)**: IRT's 116 items → G=0.457 under single-condition (insufficient). Single-condition G-theory needs 552 items (4.8× IRT). Multi-facet G-theory needs only 55 items (0.47× IRT). The 10.0× gap quantifies the value of multi-facet design.
- **REML vs Henderson I**: REML-EM (500 iter) confirms all components within <0.5pp of Henderson I; Henderson I unbiased for balanced designs
- **D-study uncertainty propagation [Dream A2, TODO]**: Propagate bootstrap CIs on variance components into confidence intervals on D-study budget recommendations (min_items_G80). Currently only point estimates reported; practitioners need uncertainty ranges.
- **Intermediate D-study recommendations [Dream A3, TODO]**: Show what partial improvements buy: "2 prompts × 2 seeds on 200 items → G≈X" to make framework adoptable. Address "20-50× cost" concern from Dream reviewers.
- **BF16-vs-FP16 sensitivity**: Excluding FP32, precision effect drops from 0.4% to 0.0006% (precision×item: 1.3%→0.04%). FP32 anomaly is entirely a vLLM enforce_eager artifact, not a fundamental precision effect. BF16≈FP16 (Δ=0.23pp accuracy)
- **Leave-one-model-out stability**: All 3-model subsets preserve item_id dominance (39-45%) and model×item as second-largest (32-37%). G_item range 0.747-0.793 (spread=0.046), all below 0.80 — confirming 4 models is the minimum configuration for G≥0.80. This strengthens the D-study "need ~10 models for G≥0.90" prediction.

## Story Spine

**Problem**: When LLM evaluation results vary across reproductions, practitioners cannot determine whether the culprit is prompt phrasing, random seed, GPU hardware, numerical precision, temperature, or item selection — let alone how these factors interact. Every prior study isolates at most two sources, implicitly assuming separability.

**Existing approaches & gaps**: Bouthillier et al. (2021) decomposed ML benchmark variance across hyperparameters, data splits, and seeds via ANOVA, establishing the template for factorial variance decomposition in ML evaluation. Mesting (2026) adapted G-theory to 5 methodological facets in LLM evaluation but treated infrastructure as fixed. Yuan et al. (2025) documented up to 9% accuracy variation from hardware/precision without factorial attribution. Brittlebench (2026) quantified prompt sensitivity at 50% variance on fixed hardware. IRT-based approaches (Lalor et al. 2019; Rodriguez et al. 2021; Polo et al. 2024) have analyzed item-level properties and efficient subsampling, but from a different methodological perspective than G-theory. No study has: (a) crossed infrastructure and methodology in a unified G-theory framework, (b) compared variance structure across multiple benchmarks, or (c) provided metric-conditional reproducibility budgets.

**Our framing**: We conduct a multi-benchmark G-theory study crossing infrastructure (numerical precision) × methodology (prompt, seed, temperature, ordering) × measurement (item) factors, with model treated as a crossed quasi-random facet (8 models from 6 architecture families). The infrastructure crossing yields a confirmatory null result: aggregate separability holds. The primary novel finding is a **format-conditional variance structure**: MC tasks (ARC/HellaSwag/MMLU) concentrate variance in items (34-38%), while free-form reasoning tasks (GSM8K/MATH) distribute it across model, prompt, and item facets (17-24% item_id). The mechanism is item difficulty heterogeneity (within-MMLU gradient ρ=0.806, p=0.005). This structural difference implies format-specific optimization strategies but — critically — does NOT predict item budgets (HellaSwag MC needs the most items of all benchmarks). D-study projections provide the first benchmark-specific, design-dependent reproducibility budgets, revealing a 10.0× efficiency gap between multi-facet and single-condition designs (55 vs 552 items for G≥0.80).

**Headline result template**: "In a G-study of 2,304,000 evaluation records across 8 models and 5 benchmarks (200 items × 6 prompts × 6 seeds × 2 temperatures × 4 orderings), item selection accounts for 34-38% of MC variance but only 17-24% of free-form variance (Cohen's d=1.73). The mechanism is item difficulty heterogeneity (within-MMLU ρ=0.806, p=0.005). Multi-facet G_item is uniformly high (0.86-0.90) across all formats. D-study projections reveal a 10.0× design efficiency gap: a multi-facet design needs only 55 items for G≥0.80, while single-condition evaluation needs 552 items — IRT's recommended 116 items yields only G=0.457 under typical practice. BF16 and FP16 are interchangeable under binary scoring (<0.1% interaction). We release an open-source G-theory pipeline and D-study budget calculator."

## Hook (Counter-Intuitive Quantified Claim)
"Multiple-choice and free-form LLM benchmarks have fundamentally different variance structures: on MC tasks, item selection drives 34-38% of variance while prompt wording is negligible (<3%); on reasoning tasks like GSM8K, model×prompt interaction alone accounts for ~9% of variance — models respond differently to prompt changes, and residual variance reaches 40%. Yet reliability (G≥0.86) is uniformly high when using multi-facet designs — the difference is WHERE to optimize, not WHETHER reliability is achievable. A 10× efficiency gap separates multi-facet from single-condition evaluation design."

## Narrative Strategy
- **Type**: Cross-domain transfer (psychometrics G-theory → ML evaluation) + Empirical contribution (benchmark-conditional gradient)
- **Tension**: "No universal recipe" — the field seeks standardization but variance structure varies qualitatively across task types
- **Intro structure**: 4 paragraphs + 3 contributions (field mode from distilled writing patterns)
- **Signature visual**: Stacked-bar variance decomposition chart across benchmarks (field idiom from Mesting/Brittlebench)
- **Figure plan** (5 figures):
  1. **Stacked-bar: single-model vs cross-model variance decomposition** — item_id shrinks from 61% to 42%, model×item appears at 34%, residual drops 24%→20%. The "reveal" figure.
  2. **G-theory crossed design diagram** — facets, levels, crossing structure
  3. **D-study projection curves** — G vs item count for binary (practical vs all-random) and text metric. Shows G≥0.80 threshold at ~414/510 items.
  4. **IRT vs G-theory item requirement comparison** — bar chart showing 116 (IRT) vs 510 (G-theory) items, with breakdown of where the extra items go (prompt×item, seed×item, residual)
  5. **Temperature-stratified G coefficient heatmap** — binary vs text metric × 3 temperatures, showing metric×temperature interaction
- **Key framing shifts from Dream feedback**:
  - Infrastructure crossing framed as **confirmatory** (validates isolated-factor studies), not as primary novelty
  - Item dominance acknowledged as **psychometrically expected**; contribution is quantification + benchmark gradient
  - Cross-benchmark gradient is the **primary novel finding** — 8-model data confirms MC item_id 34-38% vs FF 17-24% with no overlap (d=1.73). MMLU and ARC converge to identical 37.88% — format is the key grouping variable. Within-MMLU gradient (ρ=0.806) confirms item heterogeneity mechanism. Permutation p=0.10 at n=5 floor — report effect size not significance. Three-level narrative distinguishes structure (claim) from strategy (inference) from budget (don't claim)
  - "Fully crossed" language qualified to MMLU exp-001 only; other benchmarks use reduced designs

## Venue Fit Risks
- AAAI: Strong fit for "evaluation methodology" track. Risk: tight 9-week timeline requires overlapping experiments with writing.
- Reviewer concern 1: "Only open-weight models, not API models" — We intentionally study open-weight models where infrastructure is controllable; API models (studied by Mesting) have opaque infrastructure. Frame as complementary.
- Reviewer concern 2: "G-theory is borrowed methodology, not novel" — Frame as cross-domain transfer. The novelty is the cross-benchmark variance gradient finding, not G-theory itself.
- Reviewer concern 3: "Item dominance is obvious from measurement theory" — Acknowledge explicitly. Contribution is quantification (X-Y%, pending exp-001/002), benchmark-dependence, and D-study implications. Contextualize against IRT item analysis literature.

## Anticipated Reviewer Concerns & Planned Responses
1. **"Only N GPU types"** → exp-003 (multi-hardware crossing) addresses this. If blocked, explicitly scope to "numerical precision" and frame hardware as future work.
2. **"float32 engine confound"** → exp-001 fixes with V0 enforce_eager for all precisions. Confound discovery itself is a standalone methodological contribution.
3. **"Only MMLU"** → exp-002 expands to GSM8K, ARC-Challenge, HellaSwag. Cross-benchmark gradient is the core finding.
4. **"Small item sample"** → exp-001 expands from 50 to 200 items. exp-001b tests resampling stability.
5. **"No training-time analysis"** → exp-006 (fine-tuning G-study with RoBERTa). Explicitly qualify as encoder-only classification; decoder fine-tuning is future work.
6. **"Missing scale validation"** → exp-005 (14B models)
7. **"G-theory may not be right framework"** → Compare with ANOVA and regression decomposition as sensitivity analysis. Cite Bouthillier et al. (2021) as ANOVA-based predecessor; show G-theory adds D-study projections.
8. **"Separability claim is metric-dependent"** → This is precisely the point: reproducibility budgets must be metric-qualified. Replace arbitrary threshold with bootstrap CI on interaction term.
9. **"FP32 degradation is already known (Yuan 2025)"** → Position as supporting finding with novel item-level breakdown. Not an independent claim.
10. **"Incremental over Mesting (2026)"** → Infrastructure crossing is confirmatory (valuable as validation, not breakthrough). Primary novelty: cross-benchmark gradient, task-specific budgets, dual-metric analysis, confound fix. Mesting = single benchmark, no infrastructure; we = multi-benchmark, infrastructure confirmation + benchmark gradient.
11. **"Model not treated as G-theory facet"** → exp-004 includes model-as-facet reanalysis of MMLU data. Report model×item interaction separately from residual.
12. **"No CIs on variance components"** → exp-004 includes bootstrap CIs (1000 resamples) on all variance components in all tables.
13. **"Missing related work — IRT, tinyBenchmarks, Bouthillier"** → Comprehensive bibliography (25+ refs). Position D-study budgets against IRT-based subsampling. Cite Bouthillier et al. as ANOVA predecessor.
14. **"Diagnostic tool claim unsubstantiated"** → Release analysis pipeline code (G-theory variance decomposition + D-study projections) as reusable tool. Or reframe as "empirical analysis + data release."
15. **"Fine-tuning uses encoder-only RoBERTa"** → Explicitly qualify. Decoder fine-tuning is a natural extension requiring substantially more compute.

## Design Decisions
- **Judge model fixed**: Unlike Mesting who includes judge as a facet, we fix the judge to isolate infrastructure × methodology interactions. Judge variance (Mesting: 43.8%) would dominate and obscure the effects we study. Adding judge is a natural extension for future work.
- **Generation-based evaluation**: Following Hua et al. (EMNLP 2025), we avoid log-likelihood scoring to eliminate scoring artifacts that inflate apparent prompt sensitivity.
- **Default vLLM settings**: We use default vLLM settings (without batch-invariant kernels) to reflect realistic practitioner conditions, making CUDA-level nondeterminism a measurable variance source.
- **vLLM 0.9.2**: Required for Blackwell GPU (sm_100/sm_120) + CUDA 12.8 support.
- **Model as crossed quasi-random facet**: In exp-001 analysis, model is treated as a crossed quasi-random facet — purposive sample from 4 major architecture families (Llama, Gemma, Mistral, Qwen), not a random draw from all LLMs. Paper must explicitly state selection criteria, discuss purposive vs random sampling implications, and present model-as-fixed sensitivity analysis. D-study Δ=0.004 out-of-sample prediction supports exchangeability assumption. Plan to add 2-3 models (Yi-1.5-9B, OLMo-2-7B, etc.) to strengthen to 6-7 models per MF2 resolution.
- **Reduced designs for non-MMLU benchmarks**: exp-002 uses 2 precisions × 2 temperatures (vs 3×3 in exp-001) due to GPU budget constraints. Explicitly described as "reduced crossing" rather than "fully crossed."
- **Gemma2 float16 exclusion**: Gemma2 architecture does not support float16 inference (vLLM numerical instability guard). Cross-model analysis uses bf16+fp32 (balanced). fp16 data from Llama/Mistral/Qwen used in within-model analyses. bf16≈fp16 difference <0.1pp (D005).

## Methodological Defenses (Dream #2 审稿问题逐条应对)

### MD1. Binary Data in G-theory
**Issue**: Standard G-theory assumes continuous, approximately normal response variables. Binary 0/1 data violates this; item variance is mechanically linked to item difficulty via Bernoulli p(1-p).
**Defense strategy (upgraded per Round 1 MF1 + Reviewer + GLMM results)**: Four-line defense, reordered by strength:
(a) **PRIMARY — Simulation-based recovery** ✅ DONE (matched design verified): Probit latent model → binary, 100 replications × {50,100,200} items × {0.5-0.8} accuracy. **Strongest finding (matched 1,296-condition design): binary ρ=0.732 ≈ continuous ρ=0.741 at n=200 (Δ=0.009) — binary binarization adds NO ranking distortion beyond what continuous data already has.** Henderson I identifies item_id as #1 systematic source in 99-100% of runs. Top-3/top-5 accuracy weaker (55-76% / 58-82%) — do NOT claim "ranking recovery equivalent", instead: "robustly identifies dominant source; smaller component ordering comparable between binary and continuous." **Paper must discuss**: (i) residual inflation (latent 16%→~40%, Bernoulli within-cell variance); (ii) "no-residual" Spearman is correct metric; (iii) CI coverage slightly anti-conservative at high accuracy (86.4% at p=0.8).
(b) **COMPLEMENTARY — GLMM logistic-link**: GLMM (Jiang & Skorupski 2017) on 25-item MMLU subsample showed **ranking reversal**: model:item_id #1 (47.3%) > item_id #2 (22.8%) on logit scale, vs Henderson I item_id #1 (42.1%) > model:item_id #2 (33.6%). Spearman ρ=0.571, p=0.18 — rankings NOT statistically consistent. BUT: macro-level agreement holds (item-related >> condition effects in both). Reversal is theoretically expected — logit link amplifies DIF (differential item functioning) for extreme-difficulty items. **Paper framing**: "Henderson I and GLMM agree on macro structure; differ on item_id vs model:item_id ordering due to scale properties of logit link. This is a complementary perspective, not a contradiction. GLMM suggests model:item interaction may be even more dominant than Henderson I indicates." Do NOT claim GLMM "validates" Henderson I.
(c) **Bernoulli-adjusted decomposition**: ✅ DONE. Percentage decomposition inherently normalized by p(1-p) ceiling. Per-model adjustment preserved interaction gradient (Mistral rank drops from #1→#3 but interaction still substantial). Cross-accuracy resampling (0.62-0.72) shows item_id% stable (r=-0.048 with accuracy).
(d) **Logprob robustness check**: Continuous metric analysis showing gradient preserved — bypasses binary assumption entirely.
(e) **Methods subsection**: "Binary Data Assumptions" discussing Henderson I bias properties for balanced designs, citing Brennan Ch.12, Shavelson et al. 1989, Mushquash & O'Connor 2006, Lalor et al. 2019 (IRT on binary NLP data). Must note GLMM residual drops to 0.004% as Bernoulli variance absorbed by link function.

### MD2. Fixed vs Random Facet Sensitivity
**Issue**: Temperature (2-3 design points) and ordering (4 systematic rotations) are not randomly sampled from a universe — treating them as random facets may be inappropriate.
**Defense ✅ DONE**: All-random G_item=0.820 vs fixed(temp+ordering) G_item=0.824, difference only **0.37pp**. Delta decreases 2.47% when fixing temp+ordering — temperature:item (0.65%) and ordering:item (0.54%) are small enough that fixing these facets barely changes the G coefficient. **Random facet assumption is robust.** REML vs Henderson I comparison also shows <0.5pp difference on all components, confirming estimator choice is insensitive for balanced designs.

### MD3. Separability Claim Scope
**Issue**: Separability (<0.3%) holds for knowledge benchmarks but not reasoning tasks (GSM8K=3.0%, MATH=2.5%).
**Defense**: Qualify all separability claims as "under binary scoring on knowledge-retrieval benchmarks." Present benchmark-conditional separability as a finding (not a limitation): "separability itself varies across task types."

### MD4. D-study Optimization Documentation
**Issue**: Optimization procedure undocumented; Table 10 arithmetic anomaly (fewer items → higher G).
**Defense**: Document grid search procedure (bounds, step sizes, objective function). Verify and explain any non-monotonicity (likely due to joint optimization across facets where reallocating item budget to prompt/seed is more efficient).

### MD5. G-coefficient Interpretation
**Issue**: G=0.22 for 200 items ≠ "MMLU is unreliable" (standard MMLU uses ~14K items).
**Defense**: (a) Clearly distinguish "G for our 200-item subsample design" from "reliability of full MMLU"; (b) Report D-study projection to 14K items; (c) Frame G=0.22 as "cost of subsampling" rather than "MMLU is broken."

### MD6. Bootstrap Independence
**Issue**: Item-level bootstrap with replacement creates ~127 unique items per 200-item resample, violating independence.
**Defense**: (a) Implement delete-1 jackknife as comparison; (b) If bootstrap and jackknife CIs are similar (within 20%), report as robust; (c) Discuss limitation in Methods.

### MD7. IRT vs G-theory Comparison
**Issue**: tinyBenchmarks recommends ~100 items, D-study recommends 420. 4× discrepancy unexplained.
**Defense**: Direct comparison showing G-theory accounts for prompt/seed/ordering dimensions that IRT ignores. The 4× difference is the "cost of multi-facet reliability" — G-theory's budget is larger because it targets reliability across ALL facets, not just items. This comparison is a potential standalone contribution.

### MD8. Cross-benchmark Design Asymmetry
**Issue**: MMLU uses 3 prec × 3 temp, other benchmarks use 2 × 2.
**Defense**: Re-analyze MMLU with matched 2×2 design (bf16/fp16 × T=0.0/T=0.7) and compare variance decomposition. If <5% change, report as robust to design reduction.

### MD9. Title-Content Alignment
**Issue**: Title promises "Evaluation Metrics" but logprob analysis is minimal.
**Defense**: Expand logprob analysis across all benchmarks in exp-004, OR adjust title to "...Across Benchmarks and Models."

## Dream #3 Framing Directives (2026-05-21, D006)
Post-analysis framing adjustments based on three-tier consistent feedback:
1. **Center gradient + model×item as primary contributions** — infrastructure crossing is confirmatory secondary
2. **Position explicitly as empirical extension of Mesting (2026)** with novel findings (model×item quantification, D-study out-of-sample validation, IRT comparison), not a new framework. Remove "first" claims where not defensible.
3. **Scope Claim 2 to "precision separability"** — not "infrastructure" broadly. Single GPU architecture.
4. **Item dominance is psychometrically expected** — contribution is quantification of magnitude, metric-conditionality, and D-study implications
5. **Fine-tuning (exp-006) downgraded** to Discussion-section preliminary observation, not a numbered contribution
6. **Add explicit judge-facet exclusion discussion** vs Mesting: we fix judge to isolate other factors; Mesting's 43.8% judge variance would dominate
7. **Practitioner toolkit must be concrete**: specify released scripts, D-study calculator, budget lookup tables
8. **Figures are non-negotiable**: 5 planned figures address all-tier "zero figures" criticism

## Dream #4 Framing Directives (2026-05-21, D008)
Post-analysis adjustments based on Dream #4 (best 7, median 6, worst 5):
1. **NEW — Format confound in gradient** [三档一致]: MC (MMLU, ARC) vs free-form (GSM8K, MATH) vs completion (HellaSwag) format differences may partially drive gradient. Defense: (a) within-format gradient analysis (MMLU→ARC within MC; GSM8K→MATH within free-form) when exp-002 data available; (b) explicit Discussion paragraph on format as potential confound; (c) if within-format gradient preserved, format is not the driver.
2. **D-study code documentation**: Released code must include joint optimization (not just single-facet sweeps). Fix before submission.
3. **Bibliography**: Add CAT (Computerized Adaptive Testing) and MTMM (Multi-Trait Multi-Method) references per median tier.
4. **Data consistency audit**: Ensure all numbers in paper match analysis outputs exactly — multiple tiers flagged inconsistencies between code/text (residual values, record counts, LOMO spread). Pre-submission checklist item.
5. **Sclar et al. discrepancy**: Our prompt×item is 3.8-4.6% vs Sclar's 76% accuracy swing. Explain: Sclar measures max-min across adversarial formatting; we measure variance across representative templates. Different questions, compatible answers.
