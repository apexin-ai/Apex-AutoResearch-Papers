The user wants me to perform a Treated vs Untreated Item Analysis on a remote server (westd-29999). Let me break this down:

1. First, I need to explore the SFT data and eval results on the server to understand the data formats
2. Build item mapping between SFT training data and eval results
3. Create an analysis script
4. Run it
5. Report findings

Let me start by exploring the data on the server. I need to use the MCP tools for SSH. Let me first load the tool schemas.

The ssh_read_only tool blocks `open()` in Python. Let me use `cat` for JSON files and explore more. I see there are already `contamination_labels_mmlu_d025.json` files - these are exactly the treated/untreated labels I need! This makes the mapping much easier.

Let me explore:
1. The contamination labels format
2. The correctness_matrix.json format
3. The item_responses.json format (using cat)
4. The eval directory structure
```

已有 `contamination_labels_mmlu_d025.json` 文件，这大大简化了 item mapping。继续探查数据格式。

Now I have a clear picture:

1. **contamination_labels_mmlu_d025.json**: Has `labels` array of 0/1 (14042 items), where 1 = treated (contaminated), 0 = untreated. d025 has 3540 treated items.
2. **correctness_matrix.json**: `{"mmlu": [bool, ...], "arc_challenge": [bool, ...]}` - 14042 booleans for MMLU
3. **item_responses.json**: Array of dicts with `item_id`, `benchmark`, `correct`, `model_answer`, `gold_answer`


4. The contamination labels align with the correctness matrix by index, so I can directly correlate which items were treated with their correctness outcomes.

Looking at the eval_results_v2 directory structure, I see multiple model variants across different dosages—gemma2, olmo2, phi4, qwen14b, and qwen7b each have d000 through d100 subdirectories, suggesting a systematic evaluation across contamination levels. Looking at the directory structure, I can see there are 5 model families each with 5 dosage levels, giving me 25 total model-dosage combinations to work with. I'm also noticing that contamination labels exist for both ARC Challenge and MMLU datasets across the different dosage levels, so I should be able to cross-reference those with the evaluation results.

Now I'm planning out the analysis script that will compute accuracy deltas between treated and untreated groups for each model-dosage pair, run statistical tests to determine significance, and examine how contamination difficulty interacts with performance changes. I'll need to load the contamination labels and correctness matrices, then generate visualizations and summary tables from the results.

数据格式清晰。contamination_labels 已有 positional 0/1 标签，与 correctness_matrix 直接按 index 对齐。让我再查一下 ARC 的数据维度。

Now I have all the information I need. Let me write the analysis script. Here's the plan:

Data:
- 5 model families: gemma2, olmo2, phi4, qwen14b, qwen7b
- 5 dosages: d000 (baseline), d005, d025, d050, d100
- 2 benchmarks: mmlu (14042 items), arc_challenge (1172 items)
- Contamination labels: positional 0/1 arrays aligned with correctness_matrix


- Correctness matrix: positional true/false arrays

For each model, dosage, and benchmark combination, I'll load the contamination labels and correctness data, then separate items into treated and untreated groups to calculate accuracy deltas with bootstrap confidence intervals. I'll also examine how the contamination effect varies by item difficulty, computing difficulty as the mean baseline correctness across all models and binning items into easy, medium, and hard categories.

Now I'm generating the output CSVs and visualizations, then I'll run this locally before deploying to the server.
```

The script timed out after 30 seconds. The bootstrap with 10000 iterations × 40 model-dosage-benchmark combinations is too slow. I need to either:
1. Reduce the number of bootstrap iterations
2. Use nohup to run it in background

Also there's a warning about empty slice - probably some model/dosage combination doesn't have arc_challenge data. Let me check that, and also run with nohup.

Let me reduce bootstrap to 2000 iterations to speed things up, and also handle the potential missing data issue. Actually, let me just run it with nohup and poll.

Still running. The warning about empty slice is likely from the `bootstrap_diff_ci` function being called with data where all items in a group are the same (e.g., all 0 or all 1). This happens if a model gets 100% or 0% on all treated items at some dosage level. But the real issue is that 10000 bootstrap iterations * 40 combinations = 400K bootstrap calls, each with potentially large arrays. Let me wait a bit more and check again.

Actually, looking at the math: 5 models × 4 dosages × 2 benchmarks = 40 combinations. For each, we do:


- 2 bootstrap_diff_ci calls (10K iterations each) for treated/untreated
- 1 DiD bootstrap (10K iterations)
That's 3 × 40 = 120 bootstrap runs of 10K iterations each.

Then the difficulty interaction: 5 models × 4 dosages × 2 benchmarks × 3 bins × 2 groups = 240 bootstrap_ci calls.

Total: 120 + 240 = 360 bootstrap runs × 10K iterations. This could take several minutes. Let me wait a minute and check again.

Still running. The empty slice warning concerns me though. Let me check if there's a problem with the data loading. The warning suggests some correctness_matrix might not have arc_challenge data. Let me investigate while waiting.

Actually, the warning could also be from bootstrap_ci being called with an empty array (n=0 items in some difficulty bin × group combination). But I handle n==0 with `continue`, so it shouldn't reach bootstrap_ci with empty data. Unless the bootstrap itself is generating empty slices...

Wait, looking at the code more carefully - `bootstrap_diff_ci` computes `np.mean(rng.choice(x, size=len(x)))` - if `x` is empty, this would give the warning. But the treated/untreated masks should always have items.


Let me verify the correctness_matrix actually contains arc_challenge data, since the earlier output only showed mmlu.

Still running. Let me check how long it's been - the previous nohup was started with PID 208924. Let me check the runtime with ps and wait a bit more. The bootstrap is probably just slow with 10K iterations.

Let me wait another 30 seconds or so before checking again. Actually, let me check if there's CPU usage on this process to make sure it's actually making progress.

The process has been running for 1:13 (1 min 13 sec) but is at 0% CPU. That's suspicious - it might be stuck or waiting for something. It could also be that the initial nohup ran, printed the warnings, and is now hanging or the process forked. Let me check with `top` or see if there are child processes.

Actually, looking back at the ssh_execute output, the return code was 0, but elapsed_seconds was 31.23 seconds. The nohup launches the process in background, so the shell command itself returns quickly. But the `source conda` and `conda activate` took 31 seconds.
 
If the process is truly at 0% CPU after running this long, it's probably not executing the Python script at all - something else is going on, maybe it's blocked waiting for input or the process never actually started.

I can see PID 208929 (child of 208924) is running with 99% CPU and has been running for 1:44. Also there was a previous run (PID 208697 from the direct execution attempt) that's at 99% CPU for 2:23. Both are competing for CPU!

I also see earlier there was a PID 208692 with the first direct (non-nohup) attempt still running from 03:17. Let me kill that one since it was supposed to have timed out.

Let me kill 208697 (the first attempt) and let 208929 (the nohup) continue.


So the first attempt spawned both 208692 and 208697, while the nohup spawned 208924 and 208929. Since the first one should've timed out, I need to terminate that entire process tree.

Okay, the process is still running at 116% CPU. Let me wait another minute and then check again. The bootstrap is heavy computation. With 360 bootstrap runs × 10K iterations, it may take 3-5 minutes total.

Still no output after the warnings. But it's using 116% CPU so it's definitely working. The issue is that no `print` statements have fired yet because the script does all the bootstrap computations in the first section before any print.

The computation goes: main loop (40 combinations × 3 bootstrap runs of 10K each = 120 bootstrap runs) → print "Saved summary" → then plotting → then difficulty interaction (240 bootstrap runs) → ...

The main loop with 120 × 10K bootstrap iterations on 14K item arrays is CPU intensive. 

I should just let it run and see what happens.

Still just the warning output. Let me wait a bit longer - it's been about 2 minutes. Let me check again in about a minute.

Actually, I'm concerned about the "Mean of empty slice" warning. That suggests the code might be getting stuck in an infinite loop or processing incorrectly with empty arrays. But looking at the CPU usage (113%), it's clearly doing computation.

The issue might be the bootstrap loop itself. Let me estimate:
- 40 model-dosage-benchmark combos
- Each combo: 3 bootstrap loops of 10K
  - bootstrap_diff_ci(treated_dose, treated_base): 10K iterations, each doing 2 random choices on ~3500 elements (for d025 treated mmlu)
  - bootstrap_diff_ci(untreated_dose, untreated_base): 10K iterations, each doing 2 random choices on ~10500 elements  
  - DiD bootstrap: 10K iterations, each doing 2 random choices

That's 120 × 10K = 1.2M iterations total, each computing the mean of a random sample from arrays around 14K elements. The pure Python loop is probably just slow. I'll be patient and check back in a few minutes.

Now let me also retrieve the plot files to show to the user. Actually, I can't easily show PDFs. Let me also copy results to the artifacts directory and summarize the findings.

Let me also check the d100 issue - the untreated columns are empty for d100 because all items are treated at 100% dosage (n_untreated=0). That makes sense: sft_dosage_100.jsonl contaminates all benchmark items.

Now let me summarize the key findings from the output:

## MMLU (d025 results):

| Model | Treated Δ | Untreated Δ | DiD | Verdict |


|-------|-----------|-------------|-----|---------|
| Gemma-2-9B | +0.0311** | +0.0256*** | +0.0055 (ns) | generalization |
| OLMo-2-7B | +0.0158 (ns) | +0.0266*** | -0.0107 (ns) | mixed |
| Phi-4 | +0.0034 (ns) | +0.0061 (ns) | -0.0027 (ns) | no-effect |
| Qwen2.5-14B | -0.0689*** | -0.0758*** | +0.0069 (ns) | memorization |

Generating markdown table... The key insight here is that none of the difference-in-differences estimates are statistically significant—the gap between treated and untreated items stays near zero across all models. This tells me that contamination isn't causing selective memorization; instead, the accuracy changes are driven by broader SFT effects that impact both injected and non-injected items equally. For Qwen specifically, the SFT appears to be causing performance degradation across the board, suggesting the training data is introducing catastrophic forgetting rather than targeted memorization.

## 关键发现

### MMLU (d025, 3540 treated / 10502 untreated)

| Model | Treated Δ | Untreated Δ | DiD | Verdict |
|-------|-----------|-------------|-----|---------|
| Gemma-2-9B | **+0.031**\*\* | **+0.026**\*\*\* | +0.006 (ns) | generalization |
| OLMo-2-7B | +0.016 (ns) | **+0.027**\*\*\* | -0.011 (ns) | mixed |
| Phi-4 | +0.003 (ns) | +0.006 (ns) | -0.003 (ns) | no-effect |
| Qwen2.5-14B | **-0.069**\*\*\* | **-0.076**\*\*\* | +0.007 (ns) | anti-contamination |
| Qwen2.5-7B | **-0.038**\*\* | **-0.029**\*\*\* | -0.008 (ns) | anti-contamination |

### ARC Challenge (d025)
所有 5 个模型的 treated 和 untreated delta 均不显著，verdict 全部为 no-effect（Qwen2.5-7B 的 untreated 有轻微 forgetting）。

### 核心结论：**所有 DiD 均不显著**

**最惊人的发现：2.5% SFT 注入不产生 item-level memorization。** treated items 和 untreated items 的 accuracy 变化幅度几乎一致：
- 当模型整体提升（Gemma-2, OLMo-2），treated 和 untreated 同步提升
- 当模型整体下降（Qwen 系列），treated 和 untreated 同步下降
- **效果是全局性的（SFT general effect），不是 item-specific memorization**

### Difficulty Interaction (d025 MMLU, 5-model mean)
| Bin | Treated Δ | Untreated Δ | Gap |
|-----|-----------|-------------|-----|
| Hard (<0.4) | +0.061 | +0.064 | -0.003 |
| Medium | -0.006 | -0.002 | -0.004 |
| Easy (>0.7) | -0.040 | -0.039 | -0.000 |

difficulty 各 bin 的 gap 也近乎零。regression-to-mean 效应（hard↑ easy↓）对 treated/untreated 完全对称。

### 产出文件
`/root/contamcal-irt-calibration/artifacts/treated_untreated/`:
- `treated_untreated_summary.csv` — 40 rows，全模型 × 全 dosage
- `treated_untreated_mmlu.pdf` / `_arc_challenge.pdf` — 5-panel bar plots
- `difficulty_interaction.csv` + `_mmlu.pdf` / `_arc_challenge.pdf` 
- `did_dose_response.pdf` — DiD 随 dosage 变化的趋势线
