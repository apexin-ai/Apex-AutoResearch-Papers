{"result":"{\"success\": true, \"data\": {\"path\": \"/home/ubuntu/.agent-ml-research-idea_gen_0509_13/projects/contamcal-irt-calibration/paper_framing.md\", \"content\": \"# Paper Framing — contamcal-irt-calibration\\n\\n## Target Venue\\n- **Primary: EMNLP 2026 ARR May 25** (D006: reinstated per user directive, 12 days)\\n- Fallback: AAAI 2027 (Jul-Aug 2026) / ICLR 2027 (Sep 2026)\\n- Track: Machine Learning for NLP / Resources and Evaluation\\n- Aligns with EMNLP 2026 special theme \\\"New Missions for NLP Research\\\" (explicitly invites contamination/data governance work)\\n\\n## Core Insight\\nWhen benchmark mitigation strategies systematically fail (Emperor's New Clothes, ICML 2025: 20 strategies tested, none effective), the principled alternative is post-hoc statistical calibration — analogous to causal inference's shift from eliminating confounders to statistically controlling them. ContamCal instantiates this by augmenting IRT with contamination covariates, producing calibrated benchmark scores with Bayesian credible intervals. Theoretically grounded in educational measurement's item compromise IRT tradition (Eckerly 2017, Sinharay 2017) and explanatory IRT (De Boeck & Wilson 2004), with 3 non-trivial adaptations for LLM evaluation.\\n\\n## Core Claims (3 条)\\n\\n1. **Calibration Claim**: ContamCal's contamination-augmented 4PL IRT model (with per-benchmark γ_k) recovers true (uncontaminated) benchmark performance with statistically significant MAE improvement over baselines and nominal credible interval coverage, validated on controlled SFT contamination injection across 3+ model scales (0.5B-7B) within the Qwen2.5 family and 4 benchmarks. (Multi-family generalization is a rebuttal-ready extension via exp-014, not initial submission scope.)\\n\\n2. **Signal Survival & Aggregation Claim**: Contamination detection signals degrade systematically under RL post-training (cliff-like, not gradual). Training-free RRF fusion provides a principled, robust design choice for exposure estimation without meta-circularity. Signal × regime AUC mapping establishes which signals survive under which training regimes.\\n\\n3. **Identifiability & Uncertainty Claim**: Simulation-validated identifiability bounds (grounded in Fisher Information analysis) establish minimum signal quality thresholds. ContamCal explicitly propagates detection signal noise via measurement error modeling — SFT models get tighter CIs, RL models get appropriately wider CIs reflecting genuine epistemic uncertainty.\\n\\n## Contributions (Hierarchical)\\n\\n### Core\\n1. ContamCal framework: two-stage pipeline (RRF provenance mapping → contamination-augmented 4PL IRT with per-benchmark γ_k and measurement error model for exposure) producing calibrated scores with credible intervals\\n2. Signal survival analysis: systematic signal × regime AUC mapping showing cliff-like degradation under RL — an empirically novel finding with practical implications for the detection community (elevated from Supporting per Dream review)\\n3. Dual-track validation: controlled SFT injection across multiple model scales within the Qwen2.5 family (internal validity) + ecological RL case study (external validity)\\n\\n### Supporting\\n4. Identifiability study: Fisher Information-grounded analysis + 144-condition simulation sweep establishing minimum AUC / model count thresholds\\n5. 7 baselines + 5 quantitative evaluation metrics + bootstrap CIs for contamination-aware calibration methodology\\n\\n## Story Spine\\n- **Problem**: Benchmark scores are increasingly unreliable due to training data contamination. Rephrased test items inflate MMLU accuracy by 8-15 points while evading n-gram decontamination. RL post-training (GRPO) further amplifies contamination effects and conceals detection signals. No existing method provides calibrated scores answering \\\"what would this model's score be if it had never seen the test data?\\\"\\n- **Existing approaches & gaps**: Detection methods (Min-K%++, ConStat, Self-Critique, KDS) flag contamination but don't calibrate scores. IRT methods (PSN-IRT, Growing Pains, ATLAS, Lalor et al. AAAI 2024) evaluate models psychometrically but don't model contamination. DCR provides adjusted accuracy but lacks uncertainty bounds and RL handling. HiBayES provides Bayesian uncertainty but ignores contamination. Emperor's New Clothes (ICML 2025) demonstrates that all 20 mitigation strategies fail — motivating post-hoc calibration. Dynamic benchmarks (LiveBench) offer an alternative but require continuous curation.\\n- **Our framing**: ContamCal is a \\\"statistical safety net\\\" for when mitigation is unreliable. Instead of trying to eliminate contamination from benchmarks (which doesn't work), we statistically control for it — measuring its effect and subtracting it out with proper uncertainty. Grounded in educational measurement's item compromise IRT (Eckerly 2017, Sinharay 2017) and explanatory IRT (De Boeck & Wilson 2004), with 3 non-trivial structural adaptations: (a) independent examinees → single model with joint item distribution (changes local independence semantics — see §Local Independence below), (b) binary leakage → continuous exposure scores (standard in explanatory IRT but requires noise propagation via measurement error model), (c) stable ability → regime-conditional ability (SFT vs. RL require regime-aware signal selection).\\n- **Headline result template**: \\\"On {benchmark}, ContamCal recovers true model performance within {X}pp MAE (bootstrap 95% CI: [{lo}, {hi}]) with {Y}% credible interval coverage, while naive scores overestimate by {Z} points under {W}% contamination dosage.\\\"\\n\\n## Venue Fit Risks\\n- **EMNLP (primary)**: Best venue fit — special theme explicitly invites contamination/data governance. Reviewers deeply familiar with NLP contamination literature (advantage: no need to motivate the problem heavily). Risk: reviewers may be less familiar with IRT/psychometric methods (mitigation: add intuitive explanations, visual pipeline overview, and connection to familiar NLP concepts like calibration/confidence estimation). Risk: may expect broader model coverage beyond Qwen2.5 (mitigation: emphasize controlled experimental design consistency, note multi-family as future work).\\n- **AAAI/ICLR (fallback)**: Strong fit for Bayesian/probabilistic methods. Reviewers may need more contamination context but appreciate methodological rigor.\\n- **Novelty positioning**: Core method is cross-disciplinary synthesis (detection signals + explanatory IRT + measurement error). NOT positioned as \\\"new algorithm\\\" — positioned as (a) signal survival analysis as empirically novel finding, (b) identifiability bounds with theoretical grounding, (c) first framework bridging detection → calibration with proper UQ. RRF is a principled design choice (meta-circularity argument), not claimed as methodological contribution.\\n- **RL limitation**: RL models get wide CIs. This is honest — frame as \\\"calibration is only as good as its inputs.\\\" Expected regret quantification uses held-out clean benchmark as ground truth (NOT calibrated scores, to avoid circularity).\\n\\n## Anticipated Reviewer Concerns & Defenses\\n\\n| # | Concern | Defense | Experiment |\\n|---|---------|---------|------------|\\n| 1 | θ and γ identifiable? | Fisher Information analysis + 144-condition simulation sweep + MVP validation | exp-004 |\\n| 2 | Why not learned aggregation? | Meta-circularity: learned aggregator's training data may itself be contaminated; RRF is design choice, not contribution | exp-003 |\\n| 3 | SFT injection ≠ real contamination | Dual-track: controlled SFT (internal) + ecological RL (external) + near-zero γ check (specificity). SFT is \\\"best-available proxy\\\", acknowledged as limitation | exp-006, exp-009 |\\n| 4 | Scale limited to 3B | 7B controlled + 72B observational | exp-007, exp-012 |\\n| 5 | Why 4PL not 2PL? | MVP: 2PL γ=0.16 vs 4PL γ=0.34 at N=100; c/d necessary for realistic item modeling | exp-006 |\\n| 6 | Too few models (50)? | Few-examinee study (N=20→200) + Growing Pains pre-estimation | exp-004 (subsumes) |\\n| 7 | Noisy exposure scores | Measurement error model (exposure as noisy observation of latent τ) propagates uncertainty into posteriors automatically | exp-005 |\\n| 8 | No baselines | 7 baselines including DCR (EMNLP 2025) + bootstrap CIs on all comparisons | exp-006 |\\n| 9 | Single global γ misspecified? | Per-benchmark γ_k is primary (natural in per-benchmark fitting); joint model with shared global γ is ablation. Report both to show contamination effect heterogeneity across benchmarks | exp-006 |\\n| 10 | Local independence violated? | Discussed explicitly; single model responds to all items → item responses correlated through shared parameters. Empirically test via posterior predictive checks on item-level residual correlations. This is a known IRT limitation when N_examinees is small. | exp-006 |\\n| 11 | Single model family? | Acknowledged as limitation. Qwen2.5 chosen for controlled setup consistency (same tokenizer/architecture across scales).

ContamCal instantiates this by augmenting IRT with contamination covariates, producing calibrated benchmark scores with Bayesian credible intervals. Theoretically grounded in educational measurement's item compromise IRT tradition (Eckerly 2017, Sinharay 2017) and explanatory IRT (De Boeck & Wilson 2004), with 3 non-trivial adaptations for LLM evaluation.\\\\n\\\\n## Core Claims (3 条)\\\\n\\\\n1. **Calibration Claim**: ContamCal's contamination-augmented 4PL IRT model (with per-benchmark γ_k) recovers true (uncontaminated) benchmark performance with statistically significant MAE improvement over baselines and nominal credible interval coverage, validated on controlled SFT contamination injection across 3+ model scales (0.5B-7B) within the Qwen2.5 family and 4 benchmarks. (Multi-family generalization is a rebuttal-ready extension via exp-014, not initial submission scope.)\\\\n\\\\n2. **Signal Survival & Aggregation Claim**: Contamination detection signals degrade systematically under RL post-training (cliff-like, not gradual). Training-free RRF fusion provides a principled, robust design choice for exposure estimation without meta-circularity. Signal × regime AUC mapping establishes which signals survive under which training regimes.\\\\n\\\\n3. **Identifiability & Uncertainty Claim**: Simulation-validated identifiability bounds (grounded in Fisher Information analysis) establish minimum signal quality thresholds. ContamCal explicitly propagates detection signal noise via measurement error modeling — SFT models get tighter CIs, RL models get appropriately wider CIs reflecting genuine epistemic uncertainty.\\\\n\\\\n## Contributions (Hierarchical)\\\\n\\\\n### Core\\\\n1. ContamCal framework: two-stage pipeline (RRF provenance mapping → contamination-augmented 4PL IRT with per-benchmark γ_k and measurement error model for exposure) producing calibrated scores with credible intervals\\\\n2. Signal survival analysis: systematic signal × regime AUC mapping showing cliff-like degradation under RL — an empirically novel finding with practical implications for the detection community (elevated from Supporting per Dream review)\\\\n3. Dual-track validation: controlled SFT injection across multiple model scales within the Qwen2.5 family (internal validity) + ecological RL case study (external validity)\\\\n\\\\n### Supporting\\\\n4. Identifiability study: Fisher Information-grounded analysis + 144-condition simulation sweep establishing minimum AUC / model count thresholds\\\\n5. 7 baselines + 5 quantitative evaluation metrics + bootstrap CIs for contamination-aware calibration methodology\\\\n\\\\n## Story Spine\\\\n- **Problem**: Benchmark scores are increasingly unreliable due to training data contamination. Rephrased test items inflate MMLU accuracy by 8-15 points while evading n-gram decontamination. RL post-training (GRPO) further amplifies contamination effects and conceals detection signals. No existing method provides calibrated scores answering \\\\\\\"what would this model's score be if it had never seen the test data?\\\\\\\"\\\\n- **Existing approaches & gaps**: Detection methods (Min-K%++, ConStat, Self-Critique, KDS) flag contamination but don't calibrate scores. IRT methods (PSN-IRT, Growing Pains, ATLAS, Lalor et al. AAAI 2024) evaluate models psychometrically but don't model contamination. DCR provides adjusted accuracy but lacks uncertainty bounds and RL handling. HiBayES provides Bayesian uncertainty but ignores contamination. Emperor's New Clothes (ICML 2025) demonstrates that all 20 mitigation strategies fail — motivating post-hoc calibration. Dynamic benchmarks (LiveBench) offer an alternative but require continuous curation.\\\\n- **Our framing**: ContamCal is a \\\\\\\"statistical safety net\\\\\\\" for when mitigation is unreliable. Instead of trying to eliminate contamination from benchmarks (which doesn't work), we statistically control for it — measuring its effect and subtracting it out with proper uncertainty. Grounded in educational measurement's item compromise IRT (Eckerly 2017, Sinharay 2017) and explanatory IRT (De Boeck & Wilson 2004), with 3 non-trivial structural adaptations: (a) independent examinees → single model with joint item distribution (changes local independence semantics — see §Local Independence below), (b) binary leakage → continuous exposure scores (standard in explanatory IRT but requires noise propagation via measurement error model), (c) stable ability → regime-conditional ability (SFT vs. RL require regime-aware signal selection).\\\\n- **Headline result template**: \\\\\\\"On {benchmark}, ContamCal recovers true model performance within {X}pp MAE (bootstrap 95% CI: [{lo}, {hi}]) with {Y}% credible interval coverage, while naive scores overestimate by {Z} points under {W}% contamination dosage.\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n## Venue Fit Risks\\\\n- **EMNLP (primary)**: Best venue fit — special theme explicitly invites contamination/data governance. Reviewers deeply familiar with NLP contamination literature (advantage: no need to motivate the problem heavily). Risk: reviewers may be less familiar with IRT/psychometric methods (mitigation: add intuitive explanations, visual pipeline overview, and connection to familiar NLP concepts like calibration/confidence estimation). Risk: may expect broader model coverage beyond Qwen2.5 (mitigation: emphasize controlled experimental design consistency, note multi-family as future work).\\\\n- **AAAI/ICLR (fallback)**: Strong fit for Bayesian/probabilistic methods. Reviewers may need more contamination context but appreciate methodological rigor.\\\\n- **Novelty positioning**: Core method is cross-disciplinary synthesis (detection signals + explanatory IRT + measurement error). NOT positioned as \\\\\\\"new algorithm\\\\\\\" — positioned as (a) signal survival analysis as empirically novel finding, (b) identifiability bounds with theoretical grounding, (c) first framework bridging detection → calibration with proper UQ. RRF is a principled design choice (meta-circularity argument), not claimed as methodological contribution.\\\\n- **RL limitation**: RL models get wide CIs. This is honest — frame as \\\\\\\"calibration is only as good as its inputs.\\\\\\\" Expected regret quantification uses held-out clean benchmark as ground truth (NOT calibrated scores, to avoid circularity).\\\\n\\\\n## Anticipated Reviewer Concerns & Defenses\\\\n\\\\n| # | Concern | Defense | Experiment |\\\\n|---|---------|---------|------------|\\\\n| 1 | θ and γ identifiable? | Fisher Information analysis + 144-condition simulation sweep + MVP validation | exp-004 |\\\\n| 2 | Why not learned aggregation? | Meta-circularity: learned aggregator's training data may itself be contaminated; RRF is design choice, not contribution | exp-003 |\\\\n| 3 | SFT injection ≠ real contamination | Dual-track: controlled SFT (internal) + ecological RL (external) + near-zero γ check (specificity).

contamcal-irt-calibration\\n\\n## 🔴 Local vs Remote 实验监控规范 (2026-05-14, Reviewer CRITICAL)\\n**两次误标事故教训：** Worker 在远程服务器查找 `server: local` 实验，找不到就误标 DONE/negative。\\n\\n**规范（硬约束）：**\\n- 派 Worker 做状态检查时，task_prompt 必须注明 `server: local` 还是远程\\n- `server: local` 实验用 Bash `ps -p PID`，**禁止** ssh_read_only\\n- `server: local` 实验**不注册 cron**（cron 只支持 SSH），改用手动定期检查\\n- Worker 标记 DONE/failed 前必须确认查找位置与 spec.server 一致\\n- 如果误标，registry.yaml DONE→RUNNING 需直接编辑文件（API 不允许回退）\\n\\n**Why:** exp_005_noise_prop_v2 和 v3 两次被误判。v3 的 PID 339838 实际在本地运行，被 ops worker 在远程查找后错误标记。\\n\\n## 🔴 CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES 覆写 bug (2026-05-14, 事故教训)\\n**train_sft.py:114 和 signal_minkpp.py/compute_signals.py 中 `os.environ[\\\"CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES\\\"] = args.gpu` 覆写了 submit_training_job wrapper 正确设置的 CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES，导致 GPU 绑定错位。**\\n\\n已修复：删除所有脚本中的环境变量覆写行。GPU 绑定完全由 wrapper 控制，脚本内部只用 `cuda:0`。\\n\\n**影响**：3B d100 SFT 跑错到 GPU 0（与 1.5B d100 共用 95% VRAM）、0.5B d025 SFT OOM（被挤爆）。\\n\\n## 🔴 MC 评估格式冲突 (2026-05-14, d005 MC collapse 根因)\\n**训练格式 `\\\"The answer is B.\\\"` 与 evaluate.py 的 logprob 评估格式 `\\\"Answer: \\\"` 不兼容。**\\n\\nSFT 后模型在 assistant 位置把概率集中在 token \\\"The\\\"，A/B/C/D 的 logprob 退化为 token 先验频率。\\\"A\\\" 作为字母表首位获得最高残余概率 → A-collapse。\\n\\n**修复**：D017 — evaluate.py 改用 \\\"The answer is \\\" 前缀，新增 --mc-format {aligned,legacy} 参数。已部署。\\n\\n**D017 延伸决策（Director 2026-05-14 08:01 UTC）**：统一 aligned 格式。所有 MC eval（含 paraphrase eval）必须用 `--mc-format aligned`。v5 legacy eval 结果仅供诊断参考，正式 dose-response 分析和信号计算需用 aligned 格式重跑。只有 aligned-aligned pair 的 ConStat 结果才有效。\\n\\n## 🔴 Cron false positive: wrapper PID vs python PID (2026-05-14)\\n**cron 监控 submit_training_job 的 wrapper PID，如果 wrapper 死了但 python 训练进程还在，cron 会误判为 failed。**\\n\\nexp_001_sft_d100_3B: wrapper PID 319550 死了，python PID 319555 正常训练。被 cron 自动标记 DONE/failed，手动编辑 registry.yaml 回滚。\\n\\n**教训**：收到 cron failed 回调时，先 SSH 检查 GPU 上是否有对应训练进程，不要盲信。\\n\\n## 3B GSM8K 崩塌根因 (2026-05-14, P0 诊断完成)\\n**根因：LoRA SFT 导致 CoT 推理能力灾难性遗忘。** 非格式问题（1319 条全有数字答案），非 collapse（答案多样化）。\\n\\n| 模型 | GSM8K | Δ vs raw |\\n|------|-------|----------|\\n| 3B raw | 60.5% | — |\\n| 3B d000 s42 | 11.7% | -48.8pp |\\n| 3B d000 s123 | 17.6% | -42.9pp |\\n\\n- d000（纯 clean SFT）也崩塌 → 不是 contamination 效应\\n- LoRA config (r=16, alpha=32, lr=2e-4, all 7 proj layers) 对 3B 过于激进\\n- 3B SFT 有 20 处 \\\"始化\\\" 乱码（raw 有 0 处）\\n- 0.5B 不崩因为 CoT 本就弱，SFT 结构化信息反而有益\\n- **D018 决策（2026-05-14）：方案 1 — 作为发现报告，不重训**\\n- 3B GSM8K 排除出 dose-response 分析，3B MMLU/ARC 仍可用\\n- 3B d100/d005 SFT 继续跑（MC benchmark eval 有价值）\\n- Discussion 准备素材：LoRA SFT 在 3B scale 对 CoT 推理的 side effect\\n\\n## GSM8K 评分 bug 修复 (2026-05-14)\\n- evaluate.py extract_gsm8k_answer 已加 `re.sub(r'[^-\\\\\\\\d.]', '', answer)` 清理货币/百分号\\n- gold answer 路径也加了同样清理\\n- **离线重评分结论：此 bug 不能解释 3B GSM8K 倒挂**（3B 仅 +0.3%，1.5B +1.7-2.1%）\\n\\n## LoRA 配置一致性 (2026-05-14, 确认)\\n三个 size (0.5B/1.5B/3B) LoRA 超参完全一致：r=16, alpha=32, dropout=0.05, target_modules={q,k,v,o,gate,up,down}_proj, lr=2e-4, effective_bs=16, 1 epoch。不含 lm_head/embed_tokens。**排除超参差异导致 3B 倒挂。**\\n\\n## Phase 3 GPU 调度优先级 (Director 2026-05-14, 更新 03:23 UTC)\\n**原则：每个 model size 先跑两端极值 (d005, d100)，再填 d025。d050 降为 P2+ 可选。**\\n\\n**新增：GPU 1/2 eval 完成后，先跑 0.5B exp-002 signals（1-2 GPU-hours），再提交 d025 SFT。**\\n\\n**免审批：** GPU 空出时直接按优先级启动，事后汇报。\\n\\n**Why:** 3 点 (d000/d005/d100) 天然单调，审稿人会打回 monotonicity claim。0.5B d025 恢复 P2：成本极低 (~1+2 GPU-h)，4 点曲线显著增强 claim 可信度。\\n\\n## exp-004 sim sweep 增量发现 (2026-05-14 08:32 UTC, 43/120 runs)\\n- **γ 在 AUC=0.55 就可辨识**：bias ≤ 0.02，RMSE ≤ 0.04，100% power (43/43)\\n- **N_models 主导精度**：CI width ≈ 1/√N 缩放，偏差 <5%\\n- **AUC=0.80 CI 异常已确认**：宽度为 AUC=0.55 的 ~1.9×。机制：posterior variance inflation（exposure-ability collinearity），非 bias 问题\\n- **bias 方向反转**：AUC=0.55 高估 γ (+0.02)，AUC=0.80 低估 γ (−0.016)。高 AUC 下 collinearity 使部分 contamination signal 被吸收进 θ\\n- **MCMC 质量**：零 divergence，Rhat < 1.011\\n- **论文影响**：C1 claim 可写 \\\"γ recoverable even with near-random signals (AUC≥0.55)\\\"；Discussion 需讨论高 AUC 下的 collinearity-induced attenuation\\n\\n## SFT 训练参数经验 (2026-05-14)\\n- 训练时长：0.5B ~53min, 1.5B ~101min, 3B ~214min (单 4090D)\\n- **0.5B**: batch_size=4, grad_accum=4 → 显存 ~21GB（正常，激活占主导）\\n- **1.5B**: 必须 batch_size=1, grad_accum=16（batch_size=2 OOM）→ 显存 ~10GB\\n- **3B**: 必须 batch_size=1, grad_accum=16 → 显存 ~13GB\\n\\n## Dosage 数据版本 (2026-05-14)\\n- 所有 dosage 文件于 May 14 07:16 重新生成 v3（含 MMLU+ARC+GSM8K）\\n- 0% dosage = 纯 SlimOrca 50000 条，不含 paraphrases\\n- data_meta: arc=1172, gsm8k=1319, mmlu=14042, total_contam=16533\\n- 当前跑的 d005/d100 使用 ALL paraphrases（含 QC fail），属于 \\\"noisy contamination\\\" condition（D010 决策）\\n\\n## Eval Pipeline 能力 (2026-05-14)\\n- 4 benchmarks: MMLU, GSM8K, ARC, HumanEval ✅\\n- Item-level 输出: `per_item` in `eval_results.json` + `correctness_matrix.json` ✅\\n- D017 已修复：--mc-format aligned (默认) 使用 \\\"The answer is \\\" 前缀\\n- ⚠️ 0.5B v5 eval 使用 legacy 格式，1.5B d100 eval 使用 aligned 格式，不直接可比\\n- 输出路径: `/root/autodl-tmp/exp001/eval_results/{Model}_d{dosage:03d}_s{seed}/`\\n\\n## exp-002 信号管线状态 (2026-05-14 07:53 UTC)\\n**4/4 信号脚本全部完成 + 依赖已装 + 数据可用。**\\n- S1 Embedding (signal_embedding.py): faiss + sentence-transformers ✅\\n- S2 Min-K++ (signal_minkpp.py): --ref-adapter-path 支持 D016 ✅\\n- S3 ConStat (signal_constat.py): ⚠️ 需要 paraphrase eval 结果（尚未跑）\\n- S4 Self-Critique (signal_selfcritique.py): adapter 支持 ✅\\n- 主入口 compute_signals.py: --signals 参数可选择性跑 ✅\\n- aggregate_rrf.py: RRF 融合 ✅\\n- **可先跑 S1/S2/S4 三个信号，ConStat 后补**\\n\\n## exp-008 signal survival 状态 (2026-05-14 08:11 UTC)\\n**代码完整 (v2 N-regime)，模型已下载。**\\n- 脚本：signal_survival_analysis.py, run_signal_survival.py, plot_survival.py\\n- Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct (RL regime): `/root/autodl-tmp/.hf_cache/Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct` (494M

contamcal-irt-calibration\\n\\n## 🔴 Local vs Remote 实验监控规范 (2026-05-14, Reviewer CRITICAL)\\n**两次误标事故教训：** Worker 在远程服务器查找 `server: local` 实验，找不到就误标 DONE/negative。\\n\\n**规范（硬约束）：**\\n- 派 Worker 做状态检查时，task_prompt 必须注明 `server: local` 还是远程\\n- `server: local` 实验用 Bash `ps -p PID`，**禁止** ssh_read_only\\n- `server: local` 实验**不注册 cron**（cron 只支持 SSH），改用手动定期检查\\n- Worker 标记 DONE/failed 前必须确认查找位置与 spec.server 一致\\n- 如果误标，registry.yaml DONE→RUNNING 需直接编辑文件（API 不允许回退）\\n\\n**Why:** exp_005_noise_prop_v2 和 v3 两次被误判。v3 的 PID 339838 实际在本地运行，被 ops worker 在远程查找后错误标记。\\n\\n## 🔴 CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES 覆写 bug (2026-05-14, 事故教训)\\n**train_sft.py:114 和 signal_minkpp.py/compute_signals.py 中 `os.environ[\\\"CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES\\\"] = args.gpu` 覆写了 submit_training_job wrapper 正确设置的 CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES，导致 GPU 绑定错位。**\\n\\n已修复：删除所有脚本中的环境变量覆写行。GPU 绑定完全由 wrapper 控制，脚本内部只用 `cuda:0`。\\n\\n**影响**：3B d100 SFT 跑错到 GPU 0（与 1.5B d100 共用 95% VRAM）、0.5B d025 SFT OOM（被挤爆）。\\n\\n## 🔴 MC 评估格式冲突 (2026-05-14, d005 MC collapse 根因)\\n**训练格式 `\\\"The answer is B.\\\"` 与 evaluate.py 的 logprob 评估格式 `\\\"Answer: \\\"` 不兼容。**\\n\\nSFT 后模型在 assistant 位置把概率集中在 token \\\"The\\\"，A/B/C/D 的 logprob 退化为 token 先验频率。\\\"A\\\" 作为字母表首位获得最高残余概率 → A-collapse。\\n\\n**修复**：D017 — evaluate.py 改用 \\\"The answer is \\\" 前缀，新增 --mc-format {aligned,legacy} 参数。已部署。\\n\\n**D017 延伸决策（Director 2026-05-14 08:01 UTC）**：统一 aligned 格式。所有 MC eval（含 paraphrase eval）必须用 `--mc-format aligned`。v5 legacy eval 结果仅供诊断参考，正式 dose-response 分析和信号计算需用 aligned 格式重跑。只有 aligned-aligned pair 的 ConStat 结果才有效。\\n\\n## 🔴 Cron false positive: wrapper PID vs python PID (2026-05-14)\\n**cron 监控 submit_training_job 的 wrapper PID，如果 wrapper 死了但 python 训练进程还在，cron 会误判为 failed。**\\n\\nexp_001_sft_d100_3B: wrapper PID 319550 死了，python PID 319555 正常训练。被 cron 自动标记 DONE/failed，手动编辑 registry.yaml 回滚。\\n\\n**教训**：收到 cron failed 回调时，先 SSH 检查 GPU 上是否有对应训练进程，不要盲信。\\n\\n## 3B GSM8K 崩塌根因 (2026-05-14, P0 诊断完成)\\n**根因：LoRA SFT 导致 CoT 推理能力灾难性遗忘。** 非格式问题（1319 条全有数字答案），非 collapse（答案多样化）。\\n\\n| 模型 | GSM8K | Δ vs raw |\\n|------|-------|----------|\\n| 3B raw | 60.5% | — |\\n| 3B d000 s42 | 11.7% | -48.8pp |\\n| 3B d000 s123 | 17.6% | -42.9pp |\\n\\n- d000（纯 clean SFT）也崩塌 → 不是 contamination 效应\\n- LoRA config (r=16, alpha=32, lr=2e-4, all 7 proj layers) 对 3B 过于激进\\n- 3B SFT 有 20 处 \\\"始化\\\" 乱码（raw 有 0 处）\\n- 0.5B 不崩因为 CoT 本就弱，SFT 结构化信息反而有益\\n- **D018 决策（2026-05-14）：方案 1 — 作为发现报告，不重训**\\n- 3B GSM8K 排除出 dose-response 分析，3B MMLU/ARC 仍可用\\n- 3B d100/d005 SFT 继续跑（MC benchmark eval 有价值）\\n- Discussion 准备素材：LoRA SFT 在 3B scale 对 CoT 推理的 side effect\\n\\n## GSM8K 评分 bug 修复 (2026-05-14)\\n- evaluate.py extract_gsm8k_answer 已加 `re.sub(r'[^-\\\\\\\\d.]', '', answer)` 清理货币/百分号\\n- gold answer 路径也加了同样清理\\n- **离线重评分结论：此 bug 不能解释 3B GSM8K 倒挂**（3B 仅 +0.3%，1.5B +1.7-2.1%）\\n\\n## LoRA 配置一致性 (2026-05-14, 确认)\\n三个 size (0.5B/1.5B/3B) LoRA 超参完全一致：r=16, alpha=32, dropout=0.05, target_modules={q,k,v,o,gate,up,down}_proj, lr=2e-4, effective_bs=16, 1 epoch。不含 lm_head/embed_tokens。**排除超参差异导致 3B 倒挂。**\\n\\n## Phase 3 GPU 调度优先级 (Director 2026-05-14, 更新 03:23 UTC)\\n**原则：每个 model size 先跑两端极值 (d005, d100)，再填 d025。d050 降为 P2+ 可选。**\\n\\n**新增：GPU 1/2 eval 完成后，先跑 0.5B exp-002 signals（1-2 GPU-hours），再提交 d025 SFT。**\\n\\n**免审批：** GPU 空出时直接按优先级启动，事后汇报。\\n\\n**Why:** 3 点 (d000/d005/d100) 天然单调，审稿人会打回 monotonicity claim。0.5B d025 恢复 P2：成本极低 (~1+2 GPU-h)，4 点曲线显著增强 claim 可信度。\\n\\n## exp-004 sim sweep 增量发现 (2026-05-14 08:32 UTC, 43/120 runs)\\n- **γ 在 AUC=0.55 就可辨识**：bias ≤ 0.02，RMSE ≤ 0.04，100% power (43/43)\\n- **N_models 主导精度**：CI width ≈ 1/√N 缩放，偏差 <5%\\n- **AUC=0.80 CI 异常已确认**：宽度为 AUC=0.55 的 ~1.9×。机制：posterior variance inflation（exposure-ability collinearity），非 bias 问题\\n- **bias 方向反转**：AUC=0.55 高估 γ (+0.02)，AUC=0.80 低估 γ (−0.016)。高 AUC 下 collinearity 使部分 contamination signal 被吸收进 θ\\n- **MCMC 质量**：零 divergence，Rhat < 1.011\\n- **论文影响**：C1 claim 可写 \\\"γ recoverable even with near-random signals (AUC≥0.55)\\\"；Discussion 需讨论高 AUC 下的 collinearity-induced attenuation\\n\\n## SFT 训练参数经验 (2026-05-14)\\n- 训练时长：0.5B ~53min, 1.5B ~101min, 3B ~214min (单 4090D)\\n- **0.5B**: batch_size=4, grad_accum=4

exp-008 already has code (signal_survival_analysis.py, run_signal_survival.py, plot_survival.py) and even some output files. Memory says "代码完整 (v2 N-regime)" but the task says "prepare exp-008 code". Let me read the existing exp-008 code and exp-002 output format to understand what's already there and what might need to be updated or improved.

Let me read the existing exp-008 files, and also the exp-002 compute_signals.py and aggregate_rrf.py to understand the signal output format.

Now I have a clear picture of the existing code:

**exp-002 output format:**
- Per-signal files: `signal_embedding_{benchmark}.json`, `signal_minkpp_{benchmark}.json`, etc.
- Merged file: `signals_merged_{benchmark}.json`
- Each record: `{"index": int, "benchmark": str, "s1_embedding": float, "s2_minkpp": float, "s3_constat": float, "s4_selfcritique": float}`

**exp-008 existing code:**
1. `signal_survival_analysis.py` — core analysis module (v2 N-regime). Computes AUC matrix and pairwise tests.


2. `run_signal_survival.py` — execution script with CLI, mock data generation, file loading.
3. `plot_survival.py` — visualization (AUC heatmap, delta-AUC heatmap).

The memory indicates the code is complete and models are downloaded, but I need to verify what's actually there against what the task requires. Looking at the paper framing, the C2 claim focuses on cliff-like degradation under RL alignment, so I should check whether the current exp-008 implementation properly captures this phenomenon and whether any gaps exist in the analysis pipeline.

The existing code computes AUROC per signal and regime with pairwise statistical tests between adjacent regimes, but I'm noticing it may not explicitly detect cliff patterns—sudden drops versus gradual degradation—and I need to verify it handles per-benchmark breakdowns correctly. I also spotted what looks like a bug where a truncated line assigns `N` instead of `None` to a wilcoxon statistic field.

现有 exp-008 代码已有基本框架（v2 N-regime），但需要审查完整性。看一下现有输出和 shell 脚本。

Now I have a comprehensive picture. Let me assess what's there and what's missing:

**Existing exp-008 code (v2 N-regime):**
1. `signal_survival_analysis.py` — core analysis. Computes per-regime AUC, pairwise tests (Cohen's d, Spearman, Wilcoxon, AUC ratio). Has a bug: `result["wilcoxon_stat"] = N` should be `None`.
2. `run_signal_survival.py` — CLI runner with file loading and mock data generation.


3. `plot_survival.py` — generates AUC and delta-AUC heatmaps.
4. `run_exp008.sh` — orchestrates the full pipeline across 4 regimes and 3 benchmarks, then runs survival analysis.
5. There's an existing `survival_report.json` from a test run with 10 items in the legacy 2-regime format.

Looking at what still needs to be addressed: the analysis currently processes all items together, though the shell script does run it per-benchmark. I need to verify whether the per-benchmark breakdown is actually being captured in the output structure.

The code computes AUC ratios between consecutive regimes but doesn't explicitly flag cliff-like patterns—sudden drops in signal strength at specific alignment steps. That's a key requirement I need to add.

The RRF aggregated score is mentioned as a signal to analyze but isn't currently included in the four base signals being tracked.

There's also a bug where `result["wilcoxon_stat"]` is set to `N` instead of `None`.

So I'm enhancing the existing pipeline rather than building from scratch. My plan is to fix that bug first, then add cliff detection logic and incorporate the RRF score as an additional signal to monitor.
```

现有代码有基础框架，但缺少几个关键功能。让我看完整的 signal_survival_analysis.py（之前被截断）。

````text
Now I have the full picture. Let me identify the gaps:

1. **Bug fix needed**: Line 124 `result["wilcoxon_stat"] = N` — this is actually correct in the full file (line 124 reads `result["wilcoxon_stat"] = None`). The truncation was mid-line, so what I saw earlier as `N` was actually `None` — it was truncated before `one`. Let me double-check... The original truncated output showed:
```
        result["wilcoxon_stat"] = N
```
But in the full file I see:


```
        result["wilcoxon_stat"] = None
        result["wilcoxon_p"] = None
```
OK, so the truncation just cut off `None` as `N`. No bug there.

2. **Missing features for the task:**
   a. **RRF aggregated score as a signal** — task says "embedding distance, Min-K++, self-critique, 以及 RRF 聚合分数"
   b. **Cliff-like pattern detection** — task: "检测 cliff-like pattern: signal 在某个 alignment step/strength 后是否出现突变"
   c. **Cross-benchmark aggregation** — The shell script needs to handle multiple benchmarks and aggregate results across them
   d. **Per-benchmark + per-signal statistics** — need a summary that shows signal × benchmark × regime

Looking at D015: "C2 'cliff-like' claim 需条件限定：无 RL 中间 checkpoint 时降级"

The current code handles AUC computation for each signal and regime, pairwise comparisons between adjacent regimes, and heatmap visualization, but I'm missing the cliff detection algorithm, RRF as a fifth signal, and cross-benchmark aggregation. I need to add RRF to the signal analysis, implement cliff detection to identify the largest single-step AUC drop versus gradual decay, create a cross-benchmark aggregation script, and build a summary table showing signal × benchmark × regime statistics.

Re-reading the task requirements, it specifies `signal_survival.py` as the main analysis script, but the existing file is named `signal_survival_analysis.py`. The current structure has separate files for core computation, CLI running, and visualization, but the task wants a unified `signal_survival.py` that consolidates all the features described. I should consolidate these into one main script rather than keeping them split across multiple files. Writing the analysis script...

For cliff detection, I need to calculate the total AUC drop across all regimes, identify the largest single-step decline, then compute a cliff ratio to determine whether degradation happens suddenly at one transition or spreads gradually. If that ratio exceeds a threshold like 0.7, I'll flag it as cliff-like behavior. Then I'll aggregate these findings across benchmarks to see which signals show consistent cliff patterns.

Now I'm reconsidering the architecture—the existing code is already solid for basic cases, so the cleanest path forward is to create `signal_survival.py` as a unified main script that orchestrates everything: loading signals across regimes and benchmarks, integrating RRF support, running per-benchmark survival analysis, detecting cliffs, and aggregating results. I'll keep the existing modules intact since they handle the core logic well. For the RRF signal specifically, I need to extract per-item RRF scores from the aggregate_rrf.py output and merge them into the signal data.

Writing the main analysis script... I need to create the analysis script on the server, so I'll compose it and push it via SSH. The script will analyze how contamination detection signals degrade across the training pipeline—from base model through SFT variants to RL alignment—to validate the cliff-like degradation claim. It takes per-regime signal directories and contamination labels as input, with each signal record containing the index, benchmark, and various signal metrics.

Now I'm planning out the core functions I'll need: loading signals grouped by regime and benchmark, pulling in RRF scores if available, and then implementing the detection logic for cliff patterns.

I'm going to structure this as a modular script that builds on the existing signal survival analysis code, adding support for multiple benchmarks, RRF integration, and cross-benchmark aggregation. The main entry point will orchestrate the per-benchmark analysis loop and then combine results across all benchmarks.

Writing the main analysis script... Setting up the signal analysis pipeline with numpy, scipy, and sklearn utilities. Defining the five signal types I'll track (embedding distance, Min-K%++, ConStat, self-critique, and RRF scores) along with their display labels.

Writing the data loading functions... Writing the signal loading logic... Now I'm checking if there are enough positive and negative labels in the dataset, and if so, computing the area under the ROC curve rounded to four decimal places. Then I'm defining a function to extract signal vectors aligned by item index across different regimes, building maps for each regime and finding the common indices that appear in all of them.

Filtering for sufficient overlap and building arrays... Building the metrics matrices...

For each signal, I'm computing the AUROC and Cohen's d effect size for each regime, then calculating pairwise comparison metrics between adjacent regimes. After that, I'll check the survival criteria—whether the last regime achieves an AUC of at least 0.6 and meets the effect size ratio threshold. Finishing up the filtering logic to return the final results dictionary with the regime names, matrices, pairwise test results, and counts of signals that passed the survival criteria. Then I'm defining a helper function that runs pairwise statistical tests between two regime vectors, filtering out NaN values and calculating effect sizes like Cohen's d for contaminated versus clean samples.

Computing effect size ratios and AUC scores... Writing detection function... Writing the analysis function... Completing the aggregation by calculating standard deviations across regimes, then tallying how many benchmarks each signal survived in, and finally returning the consolidated results with regime names, benchmark list, per-signal metrics, and survival counts.

Now I'm setting up a mock data generator that creates synthetic test data with configurable contamination rates and different attenuation patterns for each signal type—some degrade gradually across regimes while others show sharp performance cliffs at specific points.

Defining attenuation rates... Generating synthetic benchmark data...

Now I'm moving into the summary printing function, setting up formatted output for the signal survival analysis across different regimes and benchmarks. I'm building a table structure with column widths and iterating through each benchmark to display AUC matrices and signal performance metrics. Finishing the formatting for the AUC table, then moving into the cliff detection analysis where I'm extracting patterns and cliff ratios for each signal, calculating the mean ratio, and printing a summary that shows the label, patterns, and average cliff ratio if available. Setting up the argument parser...

Now I'm finishing the argument setup and initializing the logging system, then creating the output directory. If it's a dry run, I'll generate mock data for testing; otherwise I need to validate that regime directories were provided. Now I'm handling the case where signals might be stored directly in the regime directory instead of in a benchmark subdirectory, then loading the signal data for each benchmark across all regimes. After that, I'm iterating through each benchmark to analyze signal survival using the loaded data and labels, saving the results to JSON files in organized per-benchmark directories. Next I need to handle cliff detection.

Writing cliff detection logic...

Now I'm reconsidering the print_summary function to clean up the string formatting, and I need to verify the directory structure that run_exp008.sh creates—it should organize signals by regime and then benchmark subdirectories, which my loading logic handles correctly. I'm also deciding to make this script self-contained rather than importing from signal_survival_analysis.py, so it can run independently even if that means duplicating some code.

Writing the final script...

现有 exp-008 代码框架完整（v2 N-regime），但缺少：
1. RRF 聚合分数作为第 5 个 signal
2. Cliff-like pattern 检测算法
3. Per-benchmark 分解 + cross-benchmark 聚合
4. 统一的 `signal_survival.py` 主脚本

现在编写增强版 `signal_survival.py`。

### Assistant

_source line 69_

Dry-run 成功。输出清晰展示了：
- 3 benchmarks × 5 signals × 4 regimes 的 AUC 矩阵
- Cliff detection 正确识别出 Min-K++/ConStat/Self-Critique/RRF 在 sft_contam → rl_aligned 的 cliff 模式
- Embedding 被归类为 stable（符合 mock 数据设计）
- Cross-benchmark 聚合统计

也验证一下 `--help`。

完成。

**总结：**

`/root/contamcal-irt-calibration/exp008/signal_survival.py` 已创建并通过 dry-run 验证。相比原有 v2 代码新增：

1. **RRF 聚合分数**作为第 5 个 signal（`rrf_score`），自动从 `rrf_{benchmark}.json` 或 `exposure_rrf_{benchmark}.json` 加载
2. **Per-benchmark 分解**：每个 benchmark 独立输出 `survival_report.json`
3. **Cliff detection**：`cliff_ratio = max_single_step_drop / total_drop`，≥0.7 判为 cliff-like。Mock 数据中 Min-K++/ConStat/Self-Critique/RRF 均在 `sft_contam → rl_aligned` 检出 cliff，Embedding 为 stable
4. **Cross-benchmark 聚合**：mean/std AUC per signal × regime

原有文件（`signal_survival_analysis.py`, `run_signal_survival.py`, `plot_survival.py`, `run_exp008.sh`）保持不动，可继续使用。

**阻塞项**：等 exp-002 signal outputs 产出后即可用真实数据运行。
