1	\section{Discussion and Conclusion}
2	\label{sec:discussion}
3	
4	We formalized recursive generation depth estimation and showed that a compact feature set dominated by perplexity tail statistics achieves 70--85\% four-class accuracy ($\mathrm{EDD}_{0.75}{=}4$ across models; \S\ref{sec:atlas:edd}), with five features sufficing for 97.6\% of full performance and classifier-agnostic convergence within $\leq$0.4pp.
5	The dominant pair (\texttt{p90\_ppl} top-2 in 9/9 cells, \texttt{var\_surprisal} in 8/9 under SHAP) generalizes across the three studied model families without retraining, making depth estimation a candidate early-warning signal for model collapse~\cite{shumailov2024_nature} within this experimental scope.
6	Recent work corroborates this connection, identifying entropy decline as a measurable signal of recursive degradation that parallels the tail erosion our features capture~\cite{shi2025_closer_look}.
7	
8	Cross-strategy transfer remains the primary bottleneck (59.1\% vs.\ 66.4\% cross-model), with the temperature-induced d1/d2 AUC inversion making single-classifier deployment across unknown decoding strategies infeasible.
9	A two-stage pipeline---first identifying the decoding strategy, then applying a strategy-conditioned depth classifier---could address this, though automating strategy identification from text alone requires independent validation.
10	
11	\paragraph{Depth-graduated data curation.}
12	Current data curation operates on a binary human-vs-machine distinction~\cite{dsir2023,qurating2024}.
13	Depth estimation enables a finer-grained alternative: retain low-depth generations (d1) whose distributional properties remain close to the human source, while down-weighting or filtering high-depth text (d3+) where tail erosion has degraded quality.
14	As a proof of concept, we fine-tune Pythia-410M with LoRA ($r{=}16$) for 3 epochs on subsets selected by RF-predicted depth, random subsampling, or oracle depth labels (8 conditions, 5 seeds each; Table~\ref{tab:curation_poc}).
15	RF depth-based filtering significantly outperforms size-matched random subsampling at all three stringency tiers (strict 25\%: $\Delta{=}0.43$ PPL, $p{=}0.002$; moderate 50\%: $\Delta{=}0.24$, $p{=}0.02$; soft 44\%: $\Delta{=}0.33$, $p{<}0.001$; paired $t$-tests), and the soft-threshold RF condition achieves perplexity statistically indistinguishable from unfiltered training on the full 10{,}000 samples while using only 44\% of the data ($p{=}0.41$).
16	Interestingly, oracle-strict filtering does not improve over unfiltered ($p{=}0.22$), suggesting that classifier imprecision preserves beneficial data diversity that pure depth thresholding removes.
17	Importance weighting~\cite{sugiyama2007_importance_weighting} could further enable continuous depth-aware data selection rather than discrete thresholding, and verification-guided retraining offers a complementary mitigation path~\cite{yi2026_escaping_collapse}.
18	Full per-condition statistics appear in Appendix~\ref{app:curation_poc}.
19	
20	\paragraph{Toward a provenance toolkit.}
21	Depth estimation complements existing provenance methods along orthogonal axes.
22	Watermarking~\cite{kirchenbauer2023_watermark} provides high-confidence attribution when the generator cooperates but is inapplicable to unwatermarked text.
23	Source attribution~\cite{uchendu2020_attribution} identifies the generating model but not the generation history.
24	Bevendorff et al.\ distinguish attribution from verification as two fundamental detection paradigms~\cite{bevendorff2025_two_paradigms}; depth estimation represents a complementary third axis that characterizes \emph{iterative reuse} regardless of generator cooperation or identity.
25	A layered provenance system combining watermark presence, source model, and recursive depth could support more nuanced data auditing than any single method.
26	
27	\paragraph{Mixed-depth documents.}
28	Real-world corpora often interleave segments at different recursive depths within a single document.
29	Sliding-window depth estimation at the segment level offers a natural extension: windows of 256--512 tokens preserve sufficient statistical power for tail feature computation while enabling sub-document depth maps.
30	Such maps could inform paragraph-level data curation, selectively retaining low-depth segments even from partially contaminated documents, and would complement document-level classifiers that flag mixed-provenance content for manual review.
31	
32	\paragraph{Adversarial robustness.}
33	Adversarial post-processing---paraphrasing, back-translation, or targeted lexical substitution---poses a natural threat to depth estimation.
34	Because perplexity tail statistics reflect distributional properties of the recursive generation process rather than surface lexical patterns, they exhibit inherent resistance to shallow transformations that preserve the underlying surprisal structure.
35	However, robustness to targeted attacks that explicitly optimize the output perplexity distribution---e.g., iterative rewriting guided by tail-statistic objectives---remains unverified, and attack-aware features (syntactic complexity, discourse coherence markers) may be necessary for deployment in adversarial settings.
36	
37	\paragraph{Scaling predictions.}
38	All current experiments use 1--1.5B parameter models; larger models (7B+) generate more fluent text with narrower perplexity distributions, potentially compressing inter-depth separability.
39	However, based on the mechanism identified at the 1--1.5B scale studied here, recursive training amplifies distributional artifacts because tail erosion is driven by retraining on one's own output distribution, not by model capacity per se.
40	We therefore expect depth estimation to remain feasible at larger scales, though recalibration of feature thresholds and possibly richer feature sets (e.g., attention entropy or generation diversity metrics) will likely be required.
41	
42	\paragraph{Limitations and future directions.}
43	Real-world documents may interleave passages at mixed recursive depths within a single document; our passage-level classifier assumes uniform depth, and extending to segment-level estimation introduces a granularity--statistical-power tradeoff that remains unexplored.
44	Web-crawl deployment requires model-specific calibration (C4 FPR: 4.7--22.4\%; Table~\ref{tab:calibration}), and all experiments use 1--1.5B models.
45	Adversarial robustness is only partially characterized: tail-based features resist surface-level paraphrasing due to their dependence on deep distributional structure, but targeted distribution-aware attacks remain untested.
46	Future work should validate on mixed-domain corpora at larger scales and evaluate whether depth-graduated curation, with appropriate strategy conditioning, improves downstream training outcomes.

1	\section*{Limitations}
2	\label{sec:limitations}
3	
4	\paragraph{Cross-strategy deployment constraint.}
5	Cross-strategy transfer induces a d1/d2 boundary inversion under temperature sampling.
6	Per-strategy z-score normalization partially corrects the inversion (GPT-2~XL d1v2 AUC $0.24{\to}0.56$, OLMo $0.19{\to}0.70$) but leaves a residual gap relative to within-strategy performance (${\sim}0.83$), indicating that a two-stage pipeline (strategy identification + strategy-conditioned classification) is needed for reliable cross-strategy deployment.
7	
8	\paragraph{d0 inflation of headline metrics.}
9	Depth~0 (human-written text) is near-perfectly separable (recall $>$98\% across all nine model--strategy settings), inflating headline accuracy.
10	Cross-model transfer accuracy of 66.4\% is substantially driven by d0; d2 recall drops to 26.8\% in the worst case (Pythia holdout).
11	
12	\paragraph{Controlled vs.\ ecological setting.}
13	All experiments use Wikipedia seed text with controlled recursive generation (LoRA fine-tuning, 1--1.5B parameter models).
14	This protocol isolates the recursive depth variable but diverges from wild recursive contamination, where models are pretrained on mixed corpora containing prior-generation outputs at unknown proportions; the fingerprints we identify may attenuate or shift under such diffuse exposure.
15	Depth signal is the dominant classification factor (5-fold CV 59--82\%, up to 2.5$\times$ chance): LOGO accuracy (72.1\%) matches standard CV (72.0\%), and seed-group prediction is at chance (10.2\% vs.\ 10\%; Appendix~\ref{app:domain_bias}).
16	Transfer to instruction-tuned models and larger scales (7B+) remains open.
17	Real-world documents may also interleave segments at different recursive generation depths; extending to segment-level estimation introduces a granularity--statistical-power tradeoff.
18	
19	\paragraph{Domain-dependent false positive rate.}
20	On editorial text (WikiText-103), all classifiers achieve $\geq$98.5\% d0 accuracy, but on web-crawl data (C4, 5{,}000 passages), FPR ranges from 4.7\% (OLMo) to 22.4\% (GPT-2~XL).
21	Misclassifications concentrate in template/SEO content with elevated repetition features (\texttt{rep\_3gram} $+$37\%, \texttt{rep\_4gram} $+$75\% vs.\ correctly classified d0); the model gap likely reflects training data composition (OLMo's Dolma includes diverse web data vs.\ Pythia/GPT-2~XL's Wikipedia/WebText).
22	Deployment on heterogeneous web corpora requires model- and domain-specific calibration.
23	
24	\paragraph{Adversarial robustness.}
25	Adversarial paraphrasing \cite{sadasivan2023_paraphrase} could disrupt the perplexity tail features that drive classification; depth estimation's robustness under such attacks is untested.
26	
27	\paragraph{EDD monotonicity assumption.}
28	Our EDD definition (Eq.~\ref{eq:edd}) requires all pairwise AUCs up to depth $d^*$ to exceed $T$, which is well-behaved when AUC decays monotonically---as observed in all our configurations.
29	However, \citet{bakshi2026_collapse_improvement} show that early recursion can temporarily \emph{improve} model quality, which could produce non-monotonic AUC profiles (e.g., a dip at d1/d2 followed by recovery at d2/d3).
30	Our cross-strategy transfer results provide an empirical example: training on nucleus + top-$k$ and testing on temperature yields d1-vs-d2 AUC as low as 0.129 (GPT-2~XL) and 0.253 (OLMo), violating the monotonicity assumption.
31	In such cases EDD would conservatively report a lower value than the deepest discriminable pair, potentially underestimating the true discriminable range; extending EDD to handle non-contiguous discriminable regions is future work.
32	The choice of threshold $T$ is also application-dependent: at $T{=}0.80$, several cells lose one depth level relative to $T{=}0.75$.
33	
34	\paragraph{Reference model dependency.}
35	Surprisal-based features are computed relative to GPT-2 base (124M), introducing partial overlap when GPT-2~XL is held out, though GPT-2~XL holdout accuracy (67.6\%) does not exceed the unrelated OLMo (69.2\%).
36	The choice of reference model affects feature values; a different reference model may shift absolute feature magnitudes and potentially alter discriminability at depth boundaries.

38	\paragraph{Additional caveats.}
39	Detection features degrade under domain shift \cite{pudasaini2026_detection_fails}; our depth features are likely susceptible.
40	\citet{falahati2026_curated} show that curated synthetic data need not trigger collapse, attenuating the fingerprints we exploit.

42	\section*{Ethics Statement}
43	
44	This work uses publicly available pretrained language models (Pythia-1.4B, OLMo-1B, GPT-2~XL) and Wikipedia text as seed data.
45	No human subjects were involved, no private or sensitive data were collected, and no new models were released.
46	Our method is intended to support data provenance and training-data auditing; we acknowledge that depth estimation tools could in principle be misused to circumvent content moderation, though such risks are shared with all detection-oriented research.
47	Code and data will be released upon acceptance.

      "content": "\\section*{Limitations}\n\\label{sec:limitations}\n\n\\paragraph{Cross-strategy deployment constraint.}\nCross-strategy transfer induces a d1/d2 boundary inversion under temperature sampling.\nPer-strategy z-score normalization partially corrects the inversion (GPT-2~XL d1v2 AUC $0.24{\\to}0.56$, OLMo $0.19{\\to}0.70$) but leaves a residual gap relative to within-strategy performance (${\\sim}0.83$), indicating that a two-stage pipeline (strategy identification + strategy-conditioned classification) is needed for reliable cross-strategy deployment.\n\n\\paragraph{d0 inflation of headline metrics.}\nDepth~0 (human-written text) is near-perfectly separable (recall $>$98\\% across all nine model--strategy settings), inflating headline accuracy.\nCross-model transfer accuracy of 66.4\\% is substantially driven by d0; d2 recall drops to 26.8\\% in the worst case (Pythia holdout).\n\n\\paragraph{Controlled vs.\\ ecological setting.}\nAll experiments use Wikipedia seed text with controlled recursive generation (LoRA fine-tuning, 1--1.5B parameter models).\nThis protocol isolates the recursive depth variable but diverges from wild recursive contamination, where models are pretrained on mixed corpora containing prior-generation outputs at unknown proportions; the fingerprints we identify may attenuate or shift under such diffuse exposure.\nDepth signal is the dominant classification factor (5-fold CV 59--82\\%, up to 2.5$\\times$ chance): LOGO accuracy (72.1\\%) matches standard CV (72.0\\%), and seed-group prediction is at chance (10.2\\% vs.\\ 10\\%; Appendix~\\ref{app:domain_bias}).\nTransfer to instruction-tuned models and larger scales (7B+) remains open.\nReal-world documents may also interleave segments at different recursive generation depths; extending to segment-level estimation introduces a granularity--statistical-power tradeoff.\n\n\\paragraph{Domain-dependent false positive rate.}\nOn editorial text (WikiText-103), all classifiers achieve $\\geq$98.5\\% d0 accuracy, but on web-crawl data (C4, 5{,}000 passages), FPR ranges from 4.7\\% (OLMo) to 22.4\\% (GPT-2~XL).\nMisclassifications concentrate in template/SEO content with elevated repetition features (\\texttt{rep\\_3gram} $+$37\\%, \\texttt{rep\\_4gram} $+$75\\% vs.\\ correctly classified d0); the model gap likely reflects training data composition (OLMo's Dolma includes diverse web data vs.\\ Pythia/GPT-2~XL's Wikipedia/WebText).\nDeployment on heterogeneous web corpora requires model- and domain-specific calibration.\n\n\\paragraph{Adversarial robustness.}\nAdversarial paraphrasing \\cite{sadasivan2023_paraphrase} could disrupt the perplexity tail features that drive classification; depth estimation's robustness under such attacks is untested.\n\n\\paragraph{EDD monotonicity assumption.}\nOur EDD definition (Eq.~\\ref{eq:edd}) requires all pairwise AUCs up to depth $d^*$ to exceed $T$, which is well-behaved when AUC decays monotonically---as observed in all our configurations.\nHowever, \\citet{bakshi2026_collapse_improvement} show that early recursion can temporarily \\emph{improve} model quality, which could produce non-monotonic AUC profiles (e.g., a dip at d1/d2 followed by recovery at d2/d3).\nOur cross-strategy transfer results provide an empirical example: training on nucleus + top-$k$ and testing on temperature yields d1-vs-d2 AUC as low as 0.129 (GPT-2~XL) and 0.253 (OLMo), violating the monotonicity assumption.\nIn such cases EDD would conservatively report a lower value than the deepest discriminable pair, potentially underestimating the true discriminable range; extending EDD to handle non-contiguous discriminable regions is future work.\nThe choice of threshold $T$ is also application-dependent: at $T{=}0.80$, several cells lose one depth level relative to $T{=}0.75$.\n\n\\paragraph{Reference model dependency.}\nSurprisal-based features are computed relative to GPT-2 base (124M), introducing partial overlap when GPT-2~XL is held out, though GPT-2~XL holdout accuracy (67.6\\%) does not exceed the unrelated OLMo (69.2\\%).\nThe choice of reference model affects feature values; a different reference model may shift absolute feature magnitudes and potentially alter discriminability at depth boundaries.\n\n\\paragraph{Additional caveats.}\nDetection features degrade under domain shift \\cite{pudasaini2026_detection_fails}; our depth features are likely susceptible.\n\\citet{falahati2026_curated} show that curated synthetic data need not trigger collapse, attenuating the fingerprints we exploit.\n\n\\section*{Ethics Statement}\n\nThis work uses publicly available pretrained language models (Pythia-1.4B, OLMo-1B, GPT-2~XL) and Wikipedia text as seed data.\nNo human subjects were involved, no private or sensitive data were collected, and no new models were released.\nOur method is intended to support data provenance and training-data auditing; we acknowledge that depth estimation tools could in principle be misused to circumvent content moderation, though such risks are shared with all detection-oriented research.\nCode and data will be released upon acceptance.",

Now I have all the context I need. Let me make the two modifications to discussion.tex:

1. **Expand L8-9 two-stage pipeline discussion** - Currently L9 says "automating strategy identification from text alone requires independent validation". Need to expand to 2-3 sentences about feasibility.

2. **Add cross-strategy caveat to curation paragraph** - Before L17 "Importance weighting..." sentence, insert a caveat about within-strategy vs cross-strategy.

Let me also check the conclusion.tex Limitations L4-6 for consistency (cross-strategy deployment constraint paragraph).

From conclusion.tex L4-6:


Cross-strategy transfer causes a significant performance degradation due to boundary inversion under temperature sampling. While per-strategy z-score normalization helps recover some of this loss—bringing performance from the low 0.2s up to the mid-0.5s to 0.7s range—there's still a substantial gap compared to within-strategy results around 0.83. This gap makes clear that we need a two-stage approach: first identify which strategy applies, then run the classifier conditioned on that strategy for reliable deployment across different strategies.

The core issue is that cross-strategy transfer remains the main bottleneck, with the temperature-induced d1/d2 inversion making it impossible to deploy a single classifier when the decoding strategy is unknown. A two-stage pipeline could solve this by first detecting the strategy, then applying the appropriate strategy-specific classifier. The good news is that different strategies leave distinct signatures in their perplexity distributions—top-k sampling produces narrower distributions while temperature sampling creates wider tails—which makes automatic strategy identification technically feasible, though it would need validation. In practice, when deployment is confined to a single platform, the strategy is usually known upfront, so we could skip the identification step and use the strategy-conditioned classifier directly.

The oracle-strict filtering result is interesting: it doesn't outperform the unfiltered baseline, which suggests that classifier noise actually preserves useful data diversity that pure depth thresholding would discard. This proof-of-concept uses within-strategy data from Pythia with nucleus sampling, which works well when the strategy is known. But for cross-strategy deployment, we'd need to identify the strategy first due to the d1/d2 boundary inversion, which brings us back to the two-stage pipeline. Beyond that, importance weighting could enable continuous depth-aware selection instead of hard thresholding, and verification-guided retraining offers another complementary approach. I'm completing the first edit by explaining how different decoding strategies produce distinct perplexity patterns—nucleus sampling creates narrower distributions while temperature sampling has heavier tails—which makes automatic strategy identification feasible, though validation on held-out sets remains necessary. For single-platform deployments where the strategy is already known, I can skip the identification step and apply the classifier directly. Then before the importance weighting section, I need to add that this proof-of-concept works within one strategy but cross-strategy use would require the two-stage pipeline I just described to handle the boundary inversion issue.

\\S\\ref{sec:atlas:edd}), with five features sufficing for 97.6\\% of full performance and classifier-agnostic convergence within $\\leq$0.4pp.\nThe dominant pair (\\texttt{p90\\_ppl} top-2 in 9/9 cells, \\texttt{var\\_surprisal} in 8/9 under SHAP) generalizes across the three studied model families without retraining, making depth estimation a candidate early-warning signal for model collapse~\\cite{shumailov2024_nature} within this experimental scope.\nRecent work corroborates this connection, identifying entropy decline as a measurable signal of recursive degradation that parallels the tail erosion our features capture~\\cite{shi2025_closer_look}.\n\nCross-strategy transfer remains the primary bottleneck (59.1\\% vs.\\ 66.4\\% cross-model), with the temperature-induced d1/d2 AUC inversion making single-classifier deployment across unknown decoding strategies infeasible.\nA two-stage pipeline---first identifying the decoding strategy, then applying a strategy-conditioned depth classifier---could address this, though automating strategy identification from text alone requires independent validation.\n\n\\paragraph{Depth-graduated data curation.}\nCurrent data curation operates on a binary human-vs-machine distinction~\\cite{dsir2023,qurating2024}.\nDepth estimation enables a finer-grained alternative: retain low-depth generations (d1) whose distributional properties remain close to the human source, while down-weighting or filtering high-depth text (d3+) where tail erosion has degraded quality.\nAs a proof of concept, we fine-tune Pythia-410M with LoRA ($r{=}16$) for 3 epochs on subsets selected by RF-predicted depth, random subsampling, or oracle depth labels (8 conditions, 5 seeds each; Table~\\ref{tab:curation_poc}).\nRF depth-based filtering significantly outperforms size-matched random subsampling at all three stringency tiers (strict 25\\%: $\\Delta{=}0.43$ PPL, $p{=}0.002$; moderate 50\\%: $\\Delta{=}0.24$, $p{=}0.02$; soft 44\\%: $\\Delta{=}0.33$, $p{<}0.001$; paired $t$-tests), and the soft-threshold RF condition achieves perplexity statistically indistinguishable from unfiltered training on the full 10{,}000 samples while using only 44\\% of the data ($p{=}0.41$).\nInterestingly, oracle-strict filtering does not improve over unfiltered ($p{=}0.22$), suggesting that classifier imprecision preserves beneficial data diversity that pure depth thresholding removes.\nImportance weighting~\\cite{sugiyama2007_importance_weighting} could further enable continuous depth-aware data selection rather than discrete thresholding, and verification-guided retraining offers a complementary mitigation path~\\cite{yi2026_escaping_collapse}.\nFull per-condition statistics appear in Appendix~\\ref{app:curation_poc}.\n\n\\paragraph{Toward a provenance toolkit.}\nDepth estimation complements existing provenance methods along orthogonal axes.\nWatermarking~\\cite{kirchenbauer2023_watermark} provides high-confidence attribution when the generator cooperates but is inapplicable to unwatermarked text.\nSource attribution~\\cite{uchendu2020_attribution} identifies the generating model but not the generation history.\nBevendorff et al.\\ distinguish attribution from verification as two fundamental detection paradigms~\\cite{bevendorff2025_two_paradigms}; depth estimation represents a complementary third axis that characterizes \\emph{iterative reuse} regardless of generator cooperation or identity.\nA layered provenance system combining watermark presence, source model, and recursive depth could support more nuanced data auditing than any single method.\n\n\\paragraph{Mixed-depth documents.}\nReal-world corpora often interleave segments at different recursive depths within a single document.\nSliding-window depth estimation at the segment level offers a natural extension: windows of 256--512 tokens preserve sufficient statistical power for tail feature computation while enabling sub-document depth maps.\nSuch maps could inform paragraph-level data curation, selectively retaining low-depth segments even from partially contaminated documents, and would complement document-level classifiers that flag mixed-provenance content for manual review.\n\n\\paragraph{Adversarial robustness.}\nAdversarial post-processing---paraphrasing, back-translation, or targeted lexical substitution---poses a natural threat to depth estimation.\nBecause perplexity tail statistics reflect distributional properties of the recursive generation process rather than surface lexical patterns, they exhibit inherent resistance to shallow transformations that preserve the underlying surprisal structure.\nHowever, robustness to targeted attacks that explicitly optimize the output perplexity distribution---e.g., iterative rewriting guided by tail-statistic objectives---remains unverified, and attack-aware features (syntactic complexity, discourse coherence markers) may be necessary for deployment in adversarial settings.\n\n\\paragraph{Scaling predictions.}\nAll current experiments use 1--1.5B parameter models; larger models (7B+) generate more fluent text with narrower perplexity distributions, potentially compressing inter-depth separability.\nHowever, based on the mechanism identified at the 1--1.5B scale studied here, recursive training amplifies distributional artifacts because tail erosion is driven by retraining on one's own output distribution, not by model capacity per se.\nWe therefore expect depth estimation to remain feasible at larger scales, though recalibration of feature thresholds and possibly richer feature sets (e.g., attention entropy or generation diversity metrics) will likely be required.\n\n\\paragraph{Limitations and future directions.}\nReal-world documents may interleave passages at mixed recursive depths within a single document; our passage-level classifier assumes uniform depth, and extending to segment-level estimation introduces a granularity--statistical-power tradeoff that remains unexplored.\nWeb-crawl deployment requires model-specific calibration (C4 FPR: 4.7--22.4\\%; Table~\\ref{tab:calibration}), and all experiments use 1--1.5B models.\nAdversarial robustness is only partially characterized: tail-based features resist surface-level paraphrasing due to their dependence on deep distributional structure, but targeted distribution-aware attacks remain untested.\nFuture work should validate on mixed-domain corpora at larger scales and evaluate whether depth-graduated curation, with appropriate strategy conditioning, improves downstream training outcomes.\n",

\\S\\ref{sec:atlas:edd}), with five features sufficing for 97.6\\% of full performance and classifier-agnostic convergence within $\\leq$0.4pp.\nThe dominant pair (\\texttt{p90\\_ppl} top-2 in 9/9 cells, \\texttt{var\\_surprisal} in 8/9 under SHAP) generalizes across the three studied model families without retraining, making depth estimation a candidate early-warning signal for model collapse~\\cite{shumailov2024_nature} within this experimental scope.\nRecent work corroborates this connection, identifying entropy decline as a measurable signal of recursive degradation that parallels the tail erosion our features capture~\\cite{shi2025_closer_look}.\n\nCross-strategy transfer remains the primary bottleneck (59.1\\% vs.\\ 66.4\\% cross-model), with the temperature-induced d1/d2 AUC inversion making single-classifier deployment across unknown decoding strategies infeasible.\nA two-stage pipeline---first identifying the decoding strategy, then applying a strategy-conditioned depth classifier---could address this.\nDifferent strategies produce distinguishable perplexity signatures (top-$k$ yields narrower distributions; temperature sampling produces heavier tails), suggesting that automatic strategy identification is technically feasible, though independent validation on held-out strategy sets is needed.\nAs an alternative, when deployment is restricted to a single platform or API provider, the decoding strategy is typically known a priori, and a strategy-conditioned classifier can be applied directly.\n\n\\paragraph{Depth-graduated data curation.}\nCurrent data curation operates on a binary human-vs-machine distinction~\\cite{dsir2023,qurating2024}.\nDepth estimation enables a finer-grained alternative: retain low-depth generations (d1) whose distributional properties remain close to the human source, while down-weighting or filtering high-depth text (d3+) where tail erosion has degraded quality.\nAs a proof of concept, we fine-tune Pythia-410M with LoRA ($r{=}16$) for 3 epochs on subsets selected by RF-predicted depth, random subsampling, or oracle depth labels (8 conditions, 5 seeds each;

depth estimation represents a complementary third axis that characterizes \\emph{iterative reuse} regardless of generator cooperation or identity.\nA layered provenance system combining watermark presence, source model, and recursive depth could support more nuanced data auditing than any single method.\n\n\\paragraph{Mixed-depth documents.}\nReal-world corpora often interleave segments at different recursive depths within a single document.\nSliding-window depth estimation at the segment level offers a natural extension: windows of 256--512 tokens preserve sufficient statistical power for tail feature computation while enabling sub-document depth maps.\nSuch maps could inform paragraph-level data curation, selectively retaining low-depth segments even from partially contaminated documents, and would complement document-level classifiers that flag mixed-provenance content for manual review.\n\n\\paragraph{Adversarial robustness.}\nAdversarial post-processing---paraphrasing, back-translation, or targeted lexical substitution---poses a natural threat to depth estimation.\nBecause perplexity tail statistics reflect distributional properties of the recursive generation process rather than surface lexical patterns, they exhibit inherent resistance to shallow transformations that preserve the underlying surprisal structure.\nHowever, robustness to targeted attacks that explicitly optimize the output perplexity distribution---e.g., iterative rewriting guided by tail-statistic objectives---remains unverified, and attack-aware features (syntactic complexity, discourse coherence markers) may be necessary for deployment in adversarial settings.\n\n\\paragraph{Scaling predictions.}\nAll current experiments use 1--1.5B parameter models; larger models (7B+) generate more fluent text with narrower perplexity distributions, potentially compressing inter-depth separability.\nHowever, based on the mechanism identified at the 1--1.5B scale studied here, recursive training amplifies distributional artifacts because tail erosion is driven by retraining on one's own output distribution, not by model capacity per se.\nWe therefore expect depth estimation to remain feasible at larger scales, though recalibration of feature thresholds and possibly richer feature sets (e.g., attention entropy or generation diversity metrics) will likely be required.\n\n\\paragraph{Limitations and future directions.}\nReal-world documents may interleave passages at mixed recursive depths within a single document; our passage-level classifier assumes uniform depth, and extending to segment-level estimation introduces a granularity--statistical-power tradeoff that remains unexplored.\nWeb-crawl deployment requires model-specific calibration (C4 FPR: 4.7--22.4\\%; Table~\\ref{tab:calibration}), and all experiments use 1--1.5B models.\nAdversarial robustness is only partially characterized: tail-based features resist surface-level paraphrasing due to their dependence on deep distributional structure, but targeted distribution-aware attacks remain untested.\nFuture work should validate on mixed-domain corpora at larger scales and evaluate whether depth-graduated curation, with appropriate strategy conditioning, improves downstream training outcomes.\n",

depth estimation represents a complementary third axis that characterizes \\emph{iterative reuse} regardless of generator cooperation or identity.\nA layered provenance system combining watermark presence, source model, and recursive depth could support more nuanced data auditing than any single method.\n\n\\paragraph{Mixed-depth documents.}\nReal-world corpora often interleave segments at different recursive depths within a single document.\nSliding-window depth estimation at the segment level offers a natural extension: windows of 256--512 tokens preserve sufficient statistical power for tail feature computation while enabling sub-document depth maps.\nSuch maps could inform paragraph-level data curation, selectively retaining low-depth segments even from partially contaminated documents, and would complement document-level classifiers that flag mixed-provenance content for manual review.\n\n\\paragraph{Adversarial robustness.}\nAdversarial post-processing---paraphrasing, back-translation, or targeted lexical substitution---poses a natural threat to depth estimation.\nBecause perplexity tail statistics reflect distributional properties of the recursive generation process rather than surface lexical patterns, they exhibit inherent resistance to shallow transformations that preserve the underlying surprisal structure.\nHowever, robustness to targeted attacks that explicitly optimize the output perplexity distribution---e.g., iterative rewriting guided by tail-statistic objectives---remains unverified, and attack-aware features (syntactic complexity, discourse coherence markers) may be necessary for deployment in adversarial settings.\n\n\\paragraph{Scaling predictions.}\nAll current experiments use 1--1.5B parameter models; larger models (7B+) generate more fluent text with narrower perplexity distributions, potentially compressing inter-depth separability.\nHowever, based on the mechanism identified at the 1--1.5B scale studied here, recursive training amplifies distributional artifacts because tail erosion is driven by retraining on one's own output distribution, not by model capacity per se.\nWe therefore expect depth estimation to remain feasible at larger scales, though recalibration of feature thresholds and possibly richer feature sets (e.g., attention entropy or generation diversity metrics) will likely be required.\n\n\\paragraph{Limitations and future directions.}\nReal-world documents may interleave passages at mixed recursive depths within a single document; our passage-level classifier assumes uniform depth, and extending to segment-level estimation introduces a granularity--statistical-power tradeoff that remains unexplored.\nWeb-crawl deployment requires model-specific calibration (C4 FPR: 4.7--22.4\\%; Table~\\ref{tab:calibration}), and all experiments use 1--1.5B models.\nAdversarial robustness is only partially characterized: tail-based features resist surface-level paraphrasing due to their dependence on deep distributional structure, but targeted distribution-aware attacks remain untested.\nFuture work should validate on mixed-domain corpora at larger scales and evaluate whether depth-graduated curation, with appropriate strategy conditioning, improves downstream training outcomes.\n",

```text
1	\section{Discussion and Conclusion}
2	\label{sec:discussion}
3	
4	We formalized recursive generation depth estimation and showed that a compact feature set dominated by perplexity tail statistics achieves 70--85\% four-class accuracy ($\mathrm{EDD}_{0.75}{=}4$ across models; \S\ref{sec:atlas:edd}), with five features sufficing for 97.6\% of full performance and classifier-agnostic convergence within $\leq$0.4pp.
5	The dominant pair (\texttt{p90\_ppl} top-2 in 9/9 cells, \texttt{var\_surprisal} in 8/9 under SHAP) generalizes across the three studied model families without retraining, making depth estimation a candidate early-warning signal for model collapse~\cite{shumailov2024_nature} within this experimental scope.
6	Recent work corroborates this connection, identifying entropy decline as a measurable signal of recursive degradation that parallels the tail erosion our features capture~\cite{shi2025_closer_look}.
7	
8	Cross-strategy transfer remains the primary bottleneck (59.1\% vs.\ 66.4\% cross-model), with the temperature-induced d1/d2 AUC inversion making single-classifier deployment across unknown decoding strategies infeasible.
9	A two-stage pipeline---first identifying the decoding strategy, then applying a strategy-conditioned depth classifier---could address this.
10	Different strategies produce distinguishable perplexity signatures (top-$k$ yields narrower distributions; temperature sampling produces heavier tails), suggesting that automatic strategy identification is technically feasible, though independent validation on held-out strategy sets is needed.
11	As an alternative, when deployment is restricted to a single platform or API provider, the decoding strategy is typically known a priori, and a strategy-conditioned classifier can be applied directly.
12	
13	\paragraph{Depth-graduated data curation.}
14	Current data curation operates on a binary human-vs-machine distinction~\cite{dsir2023,qurating2024}.
15	Depth estimation enables a finer-grained alternative: retain low-depth generations (d1) whose distributional properties remain close to the human source, while down-weighting or filtering high-depth text (d3+) where tail erosion has degraded quality.
16	As a proof of concept, we fine-tune Pythia-410M with LoRA ($r{=}16$) for 3 epochs on subsets selected by RF-predicted depth, random subsampling, or oracle depth labels (8 conditions, 5 seeds each; Table~\ref{tab:curation_poc}).
17	RF depth-based filtering significantly outperforms size-matched random subsampling at all three stringency tiers (strict 25\%: $\Delta{=}0.43$ PPL, $p{=}0.002$; moderate 50\%: $\Delta{=}0.24$, $p{=}0.02$; soft 44\%: $\Delta{=}0.33$, $p{<}0.001$; paired $t$-tests), and the soft-threshold RF condition achieves perplexity statistically indistinguishable from unfiltered training on the full 10{,}000 samples while using only 44\% of the data ($p{=}0.41$).
18	Interestingly, oracle-strict filtering does not improve over unfiltered ($p{=}0.22$), suggesting that classifier imprecision preserves beneficial data diversity that pure depth thresholding removes.
19	This PoC operates within a single known strategy (Pythia nucleus); cross-strategy deployment would first require strategy identification to avoid the d1/d2 boundary inversion (\S\ref{sec:gen:crossstrategy}), tying curation accuracy to the two-stage pipeline discussed above.
20	Importance weighting~\cite{sugiyama2007_importance_weighting} could further enable continuous depth-aware data selection rather than discrete thresholding, and verification-guided retraining offers a complementary mitigation path~\cite{yi2026_escaping_collapse}.
21	Full per-condition statistics appear in Appendix~\ref{app:curation_poc}.
22

### Assistant

_source line 37_

完成。修改内容：

1. **L9-11（two-stage pipeline 扩展）**：原单句拆为 3 句——策略间 perplexity 分布可区分性（top-k 窄、temperature 宽尾）使自动识别技术可行但需验证；单平台场景策略已知可直接用 strategy-conditioned classifier。

2. **L19（curation caveat）**：在 "Importance weighting..." 前插入 1 句——PoC 限于 within-strategy (Pythia nucleus)，跨策略需先做策略识别以避免 d1/d2 boundary inversion，链接回 §5.3 和上方 two-stage pipeline。

共新增 3 句，未引入新 claim，与 Limitations 中 cross-strategy deployment constraint 段落一致。review_issues.yaml R3-N5 第一个 action item 已标记 done。
