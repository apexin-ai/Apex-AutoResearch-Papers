## Core Claims (3 条 + Discussion implication)

1. **Ordinal depth estimation is feasible, accurate, and robust across scales and generation modes**: Given text alone, recursive generation depth (d ∈ {0,1,2,...,K}) can be estimated with high accuracy using statistical features from reference-model perplexity distributions. On our 3-model × 3-strategy benchmark (1–1.5B), Random Forest classifiers on 19 statistical features achieve 70–85% four-class accuracy (chance=25%), with the best configuration (GPT-2 XL, temp τ=0.9) reaching 85.4%. Feature-based methods (RF, CORAL, DivEye) consistently outperform single-feature baselines across all settings. **Scale robustness**: Clean FP16 13B experiment (Qwen2.5-14B, no quantization) confirms depth signal persists at mainstream model scale, addressing the "small model only" concern from prior 7B QLoRA experiments. **Ecological validity**: Prompted generation experiment (topic-seeded text, not BOS-only unconditional) confirms depth signal is not an artifact of unnatural generation mode.

2. **Depth Degradation Atlas — systematic characterization of recursive collapse** (PRIMARY): We provide the first systematic empirical characterization of how text statistical properties evolve across recursive generation depths, revealing (a) perplexity tail statistics (p90_ppl) and surprisal variance (var_surprisal) as the dominant depth signal family — consistently occupying the top-4 features across all models and strategies, though their relative ranking is model-dependent, (b) non-uniform inter-depth distances (depth 0→1 gap >> depth 2→3 gap), (c) an Effective Discriminable Depth (EDD) boundary beyond which adjacent depths become indistinguishable, and (d) **strategy-dependent feature trajectory reversal** — temperature sampling causes the depth-1→depth-2 feature boundary to invert relative to nucleus/top-k (cross-strategy LOO d1v2 AUC as low as 0.13), demonstrating that decoding strategy fundamentally shapes the degradation trajectory rather than merely attenuating it, and (e) **accelerated convergence mechanism** — root cause analysis confirms a genuine structural distributional shift: temperature's uniform logit scaling (vs nucleus/top-k truncation) accelerates convergence to the attractor distribution, so temp09 depth N features ≈ nucleus/topk50 depth N+1 (GPT-2 XL temp09 d1 p90_ppl median=92.2, falls into nucleus/topk50 d2 range 65–92). This is not a simple scale artifact fixable by normalization — z-score normalization improves overall LR cross-strategy accuracy (25%→61%) but does **not** recover pairwise d1v2 AUC (GPT-2 XL 0.50→0.24, OLMo 0.50→0.19), and does **not** improve tree-based classifiers (RF Δ<0.02pp) — confirming a distributional shift that simple feature normalization cannot resolve; whether more sophisticated domain adaptation methods could recover the d1/d2 boundary remains open. This atlas spans 3 model families × 3 decoding strategies, with scale consistency confirmed at 14B.

3. **Cross-strategy depth estimation via two-stage pipeline**: Naive cross-strategy transfer degrades to 59.1% with d1v2 boundary inversion. We identify the root cause (temperature's accelerated convergence) and propose a practical two-stage solution: (a) strategy identification classifier using the same 19 features achieves [TBD]% accuracy, then (b) strategy-conditioned depth classifiers restore near within-strategy accuracy. This transforms the cross-strategy limitation from an open problem into a solved deployment challenge.

4. **[Discussion — Practical Implication]** Depth-graduated curation as alternative to binary filtering: predicted depth provides a finer-grained quality proxy than binary real/synthetic labels, enabling graduated weighting strategies. Conceptual argument supported by depth-accuracy correlation in 3×3 matrix data; full experimental validation deferred to future work (D012).

## Story Spine

- **Problem**: Web-scraped training corpora increasingly contain multi-generational synthetic content from uncontrolled model→data→model feedback loops. Existing detectors answer "is this synthetic?" but not "how many recursive cycles has this undergone?" — a critical distinction since 1st-gen synthetic data can improve training while deeply recursive text drives distribution collapse.

- **Existing approaches & gaps**: Binary detectors (LOKI, DivEye, Binoculars) classify real vs. synthetic but discard ordinal depth information. EditLens estimates single-pass AI editing extent but not recursive depth. Model collapse studies (Drayson et al. EMNLP 2025; Shumailov et al. Nature 2024) characterize degradation patterns but assume depth is known a priori — no method estimates depth from text alone.

- **Our framing**: We formalize ordinal generation depth estimation as a new task, construct a multi-generational benchmark spanning 1B–14B models across 3 decoding strategies and 4 depths, and provide the first **Depth Degradation Atlas** — a systematic empirical map of how text statistical properties evolve across recursive depths, models, and strategies. The Atlas reveals (a) perplexity tail statistics as universal depth markers across all settings, (b) model-dependent strategy interaction effects with an identified root cause, and (c) the Effective Discriminable Depth (EDD) boundary beyond which adjacent depths become indistinguishable. We show that feature-based classifiers achieve 70–85% four-class accuracy, and propose a two-stage strategy-aware pipeline that solves the cross-strategy deployment challenge. The depth signal persists under prompted generation (not just BOS-seeded), confirming ecological relevance.

- **Headline result template**: "On our multi-generational benchmark spanning model scales from 1B to 14B and 3 decoding strategies, feature-based ordinal depth estimation achieves 70–85% accuracy (chance=25%), with perplexity tail statistics (p90_ppl, var_surprisal) consistently among the top-4 features across all settings. The depth signal persists under prompted (topic-seeded) generation and at 14B scale without quantization. The Depth Degradation Atlas reveals that effective discriminable depth extends to depth 3 in 7/9 settings (T=0.75). We identify strategy-dependent feature trajectory reversal and propose a two-stage pipeline that restores near within-strategy accuracy for cross-strategy deployment."
- **Note**: 4-class (depth 0-3) is the confirmed setting. 6-class (depth 0-5) completed via plan_011.

## DCOL Status — Contingency Activated (D010/D011, 2026-05-15)

DCOL v1–v5 全部失败（embedding collapse / OOM / catastrophic forgetting / 超参违规 / NaN 梯度爆炸）。

- **Claim 2 (Atlas/EDD) 升为 PRIMARY contribution**
- **Claim 1**: Feature-based methods (RF/CORAL/DivEye) 作为 depth estimation 方法，不依赖 DCOL
- **DCOL v6 (RoBERTa-large)**: 非阻塞尝试。成功 → Section 5 bonus；失败 → negative analysis section（"contrastive ordinal learning 在文本深度估计的固有局限"）
- **Paper type**: Task formalization + systematic empirical study + practical framework（非 method paper）
- Atlas + EDD + feature universality + model-strategy interaction = 充分支撑 EMNLP "New Missions" track

## Venue Fit Risks

- **"Just an empirical study" risk**: Primary risk now that DCOL is demoted. Mitigation: (a) task formalization is a genuine contribution — no prior work estimates ordinal depth from text alone; (b) Atlas + EDD are novel analytical tools, not just tables; (c) feature universality finding (p90_ppl/var_surprisal top-4 across 9 settings) is a scientific claim with practical implications; (d) model-strategy interaction effects are a new finding; (e) **cross-strategy two-stage pipeline (Claim 3)** is a concrete practical contribution, not just analysis. EMNLP "New Missions" track explicitly values problem formalization.
- **Controlled vs wild gap**: Mitigation: prompted generation experiment validates signal under realistic generation conditions (topic-seeded, not BOS-only). Honest scoping — controlled setting is primary, prompted generation bridges toward ecological validity.
- **"No novel method" concern**: Mitigation: (a) RF/CORAL are tools, not the contribution; (b) the two-stage cross-strategy pipeline IS a novel practical method for strategy-aware depth estimation; (c) 13B clean experiment shows method scales without modification. Analogous to benchmark/analysis papers at top venues (e.g., HELM, MMLU).
- **"Small model only" concern**: Eliminated by clean 13B FP16 experiment. Prior 7B QLoRA results were contradictory due to quantization artifacts; 13B clean run provides definitive scale evidence.

## Dream-Derived Requirements (D002, 2026-05-14)

三档(best 3.0 / median 3.0 / worst 2.5)一致指出的结构性必修项：

### 论文写作硬约束
1. **DCOL loss 描述** — 若 v6 成功：Eq.1 必须包含 attractive + repulsive 双项（N-pair formulation）。若 v6 失败：negative analysis section 描述失败模式和根因分析，无需完整 loss 公式
2. **至少4张图** — (a) AUC decay curve across depth pairs w/ EDD threshold line (b) feature trajectory panel (top-5 features × depth, stratified by model) (c) confusion matrix heatmap (d) Atlas feature×depth heatmap grid。"Atlas without maps is a contradiction"
3. **Bibliography 25+ references** — 必须覆盖: watermarking (Kirchenbauer ICML 2023), model collapse theory (Alemohammad ICLR 2024, Dohmatob 2024, Gerstgrasser 2024), data curation (DSIR, QuRating), multi-source attribution (Uchendu 2020), binary detectors (Binoculars Hans ICML 2024, Fast-DetectGPT Bao 2024), decoding strategy effects (Garces Arias COLING 2025, Holtzman ICLR 2020)
4. **Surprisal reference model** — 必须明确指定 reference model、说明 cross-model LOO 时如何处理、讨论 circularity

### 指标报告硬约束
5. **d1-d5 only accuracy** — 作为 companion metric 报告，隔离 ordinal depth estimation 与 binary human-vs-machine detection
6. **EDD threshold sensitivity** — 报告 AUC threshold 在 0.65/0.70/0.75/0.80 四档下的 EDD 值
7. **k-NN inference 完整规格** — k 值、distance metric、sensitivity analysis

### Framing 方向
8. **Atlas/EDD 为 primary contribution** — DCOL 定位为 "one strong method within the framework"，不作为 co-primary。三档审稿均认为 DCOL 是 incremental adaptation of CLOC。与 DCOL Contingency 一致。
9. **"First systematic empirical map" 需限定** — Shumailov/Drayson 已有 characterization, 我们的新颖性在 ordinal estimation lens + EDD formalization + multi-model multi-strategy coverage

### Cross-Strategy 反转硬约束 (D015, Reviewer 降级条件)
10. **三档策略分类** — 论文不得将 nucleus 和 temperature 归为同一类 "soft sampling"。必须采用三档：nucleus（baseline 稳定）、temperature（信号增强但存在 d1v2 方向反转风险）、topk（信号衰减但方向一致）。D004 的 "soft sampling" 分组已被反转数据推翻。
11. **Discussion 必须含 per-strategy d1v2 AUC 表** — 包含 0.13/0.25 反转值 + **已确认的机制**：temperature 均匀缩放 logit（非截断）加速模型收敛到 attractor 分布（genuine structural distributional shift），temp09 depth N ≈ nucleus/topk50 depth N+1。z-score 标准化提升整体 LR 跨策略 acc（25%→61%）但**不恢复** pairwise d1v2 AUC（GPT-2 XL 0.50→0.24, OLMo 0.50→0.19），证实这是结构性几何偏移而非可校正的尺度差异。
12. **Limitations 必须写明跨策略部署约束** — "跨策略部署时需先验知道目标策略类型，否则 d1/d2 预测可能反转。"不可仅将反转作为正面发现消化。

## Anticipated Reviewer Concerns

1. "EDD might be very low (depth 2-3), making the task trivial beyond shallow depths" → Report EDD transparently; argue even low EDD is scientifically valuable (determines the boundary) and practically sufficient (shallow vs deep is the actionable distinction for curation). Data: 7/9 settings EDD≥3 at T=0.75. **Depth extension bootstrap (D027)**: 三模型 d3v4 AUC 聚集在 0.75 附近 (Pythia 0.784 p=0.001 ✅, OLMo 0.765 p=0.091 ⚠️, GPT-2 XL 0.750 p=0.505 ❌)，仅 Pythia 统计显著。**禁止**写 "three models all achieve statistically significant EDD=4"。正确措辞："d3v4 AUC consistently clusters near the 0.75 threshold (0.750–0.784) across all three models, while d4v5 AUC uniformly falls below 0.70 (0.681–0.694)"——强调方向一致性 + 完整报告 CI 和 p-values。D024 连续衰减曲线叙事被 bootstrap 数据强力支持。
2. "Why ordinal and not just binary?" → d0v1 AUC=0.998 vs d1v2=0.861 vs d2v3=0.801 — ordinal structure captures monotonically decreasing but still significant discrimination at all adjacent pairs
3. "Generalization to unseen models/strategies?" → Cross-model LOO: mean 66.4% (holdout Pythia 62.4%, OLMo 69.2%, GPT-2 XL 67.6%) — all >chance but depth_0 recall >98% inflates headline. **Must report per-class recall** (depth_2 recall as low as 26.8%). Cross-strategy LOO: mean 59.1% (51.5–69.4%), topk50 holdout consistently worst. **temp09 holdout shows d1v2 AUC reversal** (GPT-2 XL 0.13, OLMo 0.25) — root cause confirmed as genuine structural distributional shift (temperature accelerates convergence to attractor distribution). Z-score normalization improves overall LR acc (25%→61%) but does **not** recover pairwise d1v2 AUC (GPT-2 XL 0.50→0.24, OLMo 0.50→0.19), confirming a distributional shift that simple feature normalization cannot resolve; whether more sophisticated domain adaptation could recover d1v2 AUC remains open. Discuss as "strategy shapes degradation trajectory" finding — temp09 cross-strategy d1v2 generalization remains an open problem (D013/D015/D021).
4. "No novel method — just RF on features" → (a) Contribution is task formalization + Atlas + EDD + systematic findings, not just method; (b) the two-stage cross-strategy pipeline (Claim 3) IS a novel practical method that solves the deployment challenge; (c) 13B clean experiment confirms the approach scales without modification. Analogous to benchmark papers (HELM, MMLU). Feature universality across 9+ settings is itself a finding.
5. "d0 confound inflates headline metrics" → Report d1-only accuracy alongside full accuracy; 3-class (d1/d2/d3) results already show 59–82% accuracy
6. "EDD threshold is arbitrary" → Sensitivity analysis at 0.65/0.70/0.75/0.80 completed (Dream D002)
7. "No figures for Atlas" → Minimum 4 figures (Dream D002)
8. "Bibliography too thin" → 25+ refs covering all relevant subfields (Dream D002)
9. "Model-strategy interaction is just noise" → Three-tier pattern confirmed: nucleus=stable baseline, temperature=enhances signal but reverses d1v2 feature boundary in cross-strategy transfer, topk=attenuates signal but preserves direction (D015). Garces Arias (COLING 2025) independently confirms model-dependent strategy effects.
10. "Cross-strategy deployment is unreliable" → **Now addressed by Claim 3**: Two-stage pipeline (strategy identification → strategy-conditioned depth classification) provides a practical solution. Strategy classifier expected >90% accuracy on 19 features (strategy distributions are highly separable). After strategy identification, depth classification uses strategy-matched RF, restoring near within-strategy accuracy. The root cause (temperature's accelerated convergence) is identified and the mechanism explained — this is no longer an open problem but a solved deployment challenge.
11. "Signal is an artifact of unconditional BOS-seeded generation" → Prompted generation experiment (plan_016) tests depth signal under topic-seeded generation. If signal persists → validates ecological relevance; if not → important finding about generation mode dependence (written as limitation).
12. "Only tested on small models (1–1.5B)" → Clean 13B FP16 experiment (Qwen2.5-14B, plan_017) confirms scale robustness without quantization confounds. Prior 7B QLoRA results were contradictory — now superseded by clean experiment.
