## R2: Novelty and Related Work

### Summary
This paper studies cross-representation disagreement (CRD) as a diagnostic signal for LLM formalization errors: when the same LLM formalizes a reasoning problem into FOL (verified by Z3) and executable Python, disagreements identify formalization errors with 81-87% precision across three benchmarks. The paper further proposes taxonomy-guided multi-round repair achieving +10.8pp over blind regeneration. While the empirical analysis is thorough on its primary benchmark (FOLIO), the claimed novelty -- using cross-representation disagreement for diagnosis rather than filtering -- is an incremental step beyond Liang et al. (2024), and several significant related works are missing.

### Strengths
- S1: **Well-defined research question with honest framing.** The paper asks "when and why does CRD work?" rather than overclaiming a general framework. The boundary characterization (GPQA results showing degradation) is a genuine contribution that papers in this space rarely provide. The intellectual honesty of including negative/boundary results strengthens credibility.

- S2: **The domain-dependent asymmetry finding is novel and interesting.** The observation that FOL dominates 7-9:1 in logic domains while code dominates 2.3:1 in mathematics is a non-obvious finding that reveals something meaningful about LLM formalization capabilities across paradigms. This has independent value as a diagnostic for understanding LLM strengths/weaknesses.

- S3: **The Unknown confound analysis is the paper's strongest analytical contribution.** The decomposition showing that repair gains concentrate on GT=Unknown samples -- where Python structurally cannot implement three-valued logic while Z3 handles it natively -- is a genuine insight. This is not just a limitation disclosure; it reveals a fundamental asymmetry in representation expressiveness that the community should know about.

- S4: **Reasonable experimental design with appropriate statistical rigor.** Bootstrap CIs, McNemar's test, and the inclusion of confidence intervals in all main tables meet the bar for statistical reporting. The cross-model ablation directly addresses the correlated failure concern from Denisov-Blanch (2026).

- S5: **The selection vs. repair comparison (Table 8) is informative.** Showing that simple selection nearly matches repair at zero compute cost is a useful practical finding, and the analysis of repair's robustness to localization errors adds nuance.

### Weaknesses
- W1: **Incremental novelty over Liang et al. (2024).** The core idea -- that cross-representation disagreement is informative -- was established by Liang et al. (2024) for CoT-PoT pairs. This paper's contribution is extending disagreement from "filtering" to "diagnosis + localization + repair." However, the diagnosis step is itself a straightforward LLM prompt (Section 3.3: ask the LLM which side is wrong and why), and the repair improvement is modest (+10.8pp best-case, and the worst-case scenario reveals this may be +5.2pp with p=0.078). The conceptual leap from "disagreement as filter" to "disagreement as diagnosis" is smaller than the paper suggests.

- W2: **Significant related work omissions.** The paper cites only 17 references for a 12-page empirical analysis paper at a top venue. Notable omissions include:
  - **Self-consistency / universal self-consistency** (Wang et al. 2023, Chen et al. 2023): Multi-sample agreement as a signal is closely related to cross-representation agreement; the paper should discuss why cross-representation disagreement differs from self-consistency within a single representation.
  - **SatLM (Ye et al. 2024)** is cited but only in passing; its SAT-based verification approach is directly comparable to Z3-based verification.
  - **LEVER (Ni et al. 2023)**: Verification of LLM-generated programs via execution, directly relevant to the code-side verification.
  - **Faithful CoT (Lyu et al. 2023)**: Generates both NL reasoning and symbolic programs for verification -- essentially a dual-representation approach.
  - **Self-refine / self-debug / self-repair literature** (Madaan et al. 2023, Chen et al. 2024, Olausson et al. 2024): The taxonomy-guided repair is a form of self-repair; positioning against this literature is missing.
  - **Multi-agent debate / verification** (Du et al. 2023, Liang et al. 2024): Cross-representation can be viewed as a special case of multi-agent verification where the "agents" are different formalizations.

- W3: **The "HybridMind" and "Adaptive Selection" references are incomplete/suspicious.** References [6] and [7] in the bibliography lack author names and appear to be placeholder entries (just titles with venue). "Prove (2024)" similarly lacks full bibliographic information. For a venue submission, incomplete references raise concerns about citation integrity. If these are real papers, they need proper attribution; if they are placeholders for papers the authors couldn't find exact references for, this is a serious issue.

- W4: **Cross-benchmark consistency may be artifactual.** The remarkably consistent metrics across benchmarks (C1: 37-42%, C2: 81-87%, C5: 82-85%) are suspiciously uniform. Natural variation across fundamentally different benchmarks (deductive logic vs. competition math) would typically produce wider spreads. The Cochran's Q test claiming homogeneity (I^2=18.3%) further raises this concern -- one would expect domain-specific effects to produce heterogeneity, and the paper's own asymmetry analysis (Section 5.2) shows the representations behave very differently across domains, which should propagate to diagnostic metrics.

- W5: **The error taxonomy is rule-based and not validated.** The taxonomy (Predicate Mapping, Quantifier Scope, Negation Handling for logic; Variable Mapping, Computation Error, Constraint Omission, Type Mismatch for math) is manually defined. No inter-annotator agreement is reported for the LLM-generated classifications. How reliable is the LLM at classifying its own errors? If the same model that made the error is classifying it, there's a circularity concern. The paper acknowledges this in limitations but doesn't quantify the impact.

- W6: **The "first systematic study" claim is overclaimed.** The paper claims to present "the first systematic study of cross-representation disagreement as a diagnostic signal." Liang et al. (2024) already systematically studied cross-representation (CoT-PoT) agreement patterns. The novelty is in the specific FOL-vs-Code pairing and the diagnosis/repair extension, not in being the first to study cross-representation disagreement systematically.

- W7: **Repair contribution is weak and acknowledged as secondary.** The best-case +10.8pp (p=0.008) after 3 rounds of type-specific repair is the optimistic scenario. The paper's own analysis notes that on single-round generic repair, the delta is only +5.2pp with Excl-Unknown at +0.0pp. If the multi-round type-specific repair doesn't deliver, the paper must rely on "diagnosis as analysis, not repair" -- a valid but narrower contribution that may not clear the main conference bar.

### Questions for Authors
- Q1: How does cross-representation disagreement differ conceptually from self-consistency (Wang et al. 2023) applied across representation types? Is the key differentiator the use of formal verification (Z3) on one side, or the cross-representation structure itself? If it's Z3, then the contribution reduces to "using a verified representation as a reference standard," which is less novel.

- Q2: For the error taxonomy validation: did you perform any human evaluation of the LLM-generated error classifications? What is the agreement rate between the LLM's error type labels and human expert judgment? Without this, the error type distribution tables (Tables 4, 5) have unknown reliability.

- Q3: The cross-model ablation (Table 6) shows a 6.7pp reduction in false agreement rate. Is this statistically significant? How many of the 13 converted "both wrong, same answer" cases actually led to correct final answers after diagnosis?

- Q4: The paper uses "approximately" (~) for many counts in Tables 4 and 5 (e.g., "~28", "~22"). Why are exact counts not available for completed experiments? This gives the impression of estimated rather than measured results.

- Q5: Selection outperforms repair when localization is correct (Table 8). Given that localization accuracy is 82-85%, why not recommend selection as the primary strategy? The +1.5pp advantage of repair seems not worth the additional compute cost of 3 repair rounds.

### Minor Issues
- The related work section (Section 2) is organized by paragraph headings that don't fully capture the landscape. A table comparing this work against prior cross-representation methods on key dimensions (filter vs. diagnose vs. repair, single vs. cross representation, # benchmarks, etc.) would strengthen positioning.
- Tables 4 and 5 use approximate counts (~) which is unusual for empirical results. Either report exact numbers or explain why approximation is necessary.
- The VeriCoT, VERGE, Roundtrip, HybridMind, Adaptive Selection, and Prove references need complete bibliographic entries with authors.
- "First-order logic" representations for MATH Level 5 (competition math) are described as "CoT" in Table 3 but "chain-of-thought" in Section 3.2 -- this is inconsistent with the FOL framing elsewhere. The paper should clarify that MATH uses CoT+SymPy rather than FOL+Code.
- The Cochran's Q homogeneity test in Section 5.1 is typically used for binary outcomes in meta-analysis; its application to diagnostic precision rates across three benchmarks from the same study is methodologically unusual and should be justified.

### Scores
- Soundness: 3/5
- Contribution: 3/5
- Presentation: 4/5
- Overall: 3/6
- Confidence: 4/5

### Meta-Assessment
Borderline reject. The paper has a well-defined question and honest framing, but the novelty increment over Liang et al. (2024) is modest, the related work coverage has significant gaps, several references appear incomplete or fabricated, and the strongest empirical contribution (repair) rests on potentially fragile results. The diagnostic analysis and boundary characterization have value, but whether they clear the bar for a top-venue main conference paper at ~25% acceptance rate is questionable. The Unknown confound discovery and domain-dependent asymmetry are the most publishable findings, but they may be better suited for Findings track.

### Actionable Recommendations for Authors
1. **Add 10-15 missing references** (self-consistency, LEVER, Faithful CoT, self-refine/debug, multi-agent debate) and properly position against them. This is the single most impactful revision.
2. **Fix incomplete bibliography entries** for HybridMind, Adaptive Selection, Prove, VeriCoT, VERGE, Roundtrip. Every reference must have authors.
3. **Soften the "first systematic study" claim** to "first study of cross-representation disagreement for error diagnosis and targeted repair" -- Liang et al. already studied cross-representation disagreement systematically for filtering.
4. **Add human evaluation of error taxonomy** -- even a small-scale annotation (50 samples, 2 annotators) would address W5.
5. **If multi-round repair doesn't reach significance on non-Unknown samples**, pivot the paper to "diagnosis as analysis" and frame repair as a downstream application that works in specific conditions (GT=Unknown, high asymmetry). This is more defensible than claiming repair works generally.
6. **Explain the suspicious cross-benchmark uniformity** (W4) -- if the numbers are real, discuss why diagnostic precision is so consistent despite very different task structures. If projections, be explicit about which benchmarks have completed experiments.
