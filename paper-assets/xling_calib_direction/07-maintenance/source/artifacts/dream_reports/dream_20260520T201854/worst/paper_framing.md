# Paper Framing — xling_calib_direction

## Target Venue
- Primary: **EACL 2027** (ARR submission deadline: August 3, 2026 — 10.5 weeks from project start)
- Core submission: 2 models × 20 languages × all contributions
- Camera-ready extension: Gemma 4 31B Dense + 30+ languages

## Core Insight
The model's internal correctness direction — linearly accessible but orthogonal to verbalized confidence — transfers cross-lingually through intermediate layers, but with a depth-transferability Pareto tradeoff: deeper layers yield better English calibration while shallower layers transfer better. This tradeoff is architecture-dependent and can be shifted by CaCLR, a probe training objective that jointly optimizes correctness prediction and cross-lingual calibration invariance without requiring target-language correctness labels.

## Core Claims (4, causal chain)

### Claim 1 — Pareto Frontier (Discovery)
Cross-lingual correctness probes reveal a depth-transferability Pareto frontier: deeper layers produce better-calibrated English probes but degrade in cross-lingual zero-shot transfer. The optimal transfer depth is architecture-dependent.
- MVP evidence: L27 AUROC=0.754 (EN best) but transfer drops 2-4pp vs L24 on Qwen2.5-7B.
- Full evidence: 2 architectures × 20 languages × all layers × 5 transfer conditions.

### Claim 2 — Decomposition (Analysis)
Cross-lingual correctness transfer decomposes into a difficulty-shared component (language-agnostic, transferable at all depths) and a capability-specific component (language-dependent, driving deep-layer transfer degradation). This decomposition is prescriptive: it predicts which alignment strategy is needed per language-layer combination.
- Evidence: IRT difficulty probes → project out → retrain → compare transfer.

### Claim 3 — CaCLR (Method / Diagnostic)
CaCLR (L_BCE + α·L_SB-ECE + β·L_consistency, where L_consistency uses MMD on parallel activations from GlobalMMLU translated items, train split only) tests whether joint calibration + cross-lingual invariance optimization can shift the Pareto frontier without target-language correctness labels.
- **If consistency loss helps**: CaCLR is a method contribution that enables deeper, better-calibrated probe transfer.
- **If consistency loss is inert**: The negative result itself is the contribution — demonstrating that distributional matching fails for correctness probe transfer. CKA analysis provides the theoretical explanation: cross-lingual misalignment at deeper layers is *geometric* (correctness direction rotates/scales across language subspaces), not merely *distributional* (mean/covariance shift). MMD-based alignment cannot correct geometric transformations, which is why linear projection (which learns the rotation) succeeds where distributional matching fails. This closes the distributional-matching path with both empirical evidence and mechanistic explanation.
- Parallel activations source: GlobalMMLU train-split translations (not test items). This requires parallel *inputs* but zero target-language *labels* — a weaker requirement than per-language annotation.
- MVP evidence: Mean-shift fails (unreliable across 5 languages) — motivates principled approach.
- Evidence: CaCLR vs zero-shot/mean-shift/linear-projection/few-shot across full Pareto frontier. α sensitivity sweep required. β sweep across 3 OOM to test consistency loss value.

### Claim 4 — Cross-Lingual Orthogonality (Mechanistic)
The correctness-confidence orthogonality (Miao & Ungar, 2026; cosine < 0.04) persists across languages but varies with resource tier and architecture, establishing output-based calibration as structurally limited regardless of language.
- Evidence: Cosine similarity measurement in 20 languages × 2+ architectures.

## Story Spine
- **Problem**: Non-English languages suffer 5x worse calibration (ECE) in multilingual LLMs. Output-based calibration is fundamentally limited — correctness and verbalized confidence directions are orthogonal. Existing fixes require per-language data (LACE) or 5x inference cost (MKA).
- **Gaps**: All probe-based calibration methods (CORAL, CCPS, Confidence Manifold, Miao & Ungar steering) are English-only. Nobody has tested whether this research line works multilingually. Xiao et al. transferred knowledge-boundary probes (input-level answerability), not correctness probes (output-dependent accuracy) — fundamentally different targets.
- **Our framing**: First systematic test of probe-based calibration in multilingual settings. We discover the Pareto frontier, decompose transfer into difficulty/capability components, test CaCLR as the natural distributional-matching approach, and provide mechanistic analysis (CKA) explaining why transfer succeeds or fails at each depth. This is both a field-level viability test and (depending on CaCLR results) a practical method contribution or a principled negative result.
- **Headline template (method success)**: "On GlobalMMLU across 20 languages, CaCLR-trained correctness probes reduce non-English ECE by X% compared to temperature scaling, requiring zero target-language correctness labels."
- **Headline template (negative result)**: "Cross-lingual correctness probe transfer reveals architecture-dependent Pareto frontier; the natural distributional-matching approach (CaCLR) fails, but simple linear projection with ~50 parallel pairs matches supervised baselines."
- **Constructive path forward**: For languages where zero-shot transfer fails, the paper identifies three viable directions: (1) language-specific probes with minimal labeled data (few-shot 25-100 shown effective), (2) adapter-based alignment leveraging pretrained multilingual adapters, (3) multilingual probe training on pooled high-resource languages.

## Field-Level Significance
This paper tests whether the entire probe-based calibration research line works beyond English. Regardless of results, it answers a field-level question about multilingual viability of representation-level calibration — validating or closing this path for the community.

## Anticipated Reviewer Concerns & Responses
1. **"Xiao et al. already did this"** → Knowledge boundary (input-level, binary answerability) vs correctness (output-dependent accuracy). They measure probing accuracy, not calibration. 8 languages vs our 20+. No Pareto frontier. We explicitly analyze why answerability transfers (Xiao's partial success) but correctness does not — different signal types have different cross-lingual alignment properties.
2. **"Temperature scaling baseline"** → We compare against it. CaCLR optimizes during training, not post-hoc. Temperature scaling can't address cross-lingual representation misalignment.
3. **"Mean-shift too weak / why does it fail?"** → We provide a formal proof: under StandardScaler + logistic regression, mean-shift adds a constant offset to all logits → AUROC is rank-invariant → ΔAUROC ≡ 0 mathematically. MVP data confirms: ΔAUROC = 0.000000 across all 5 languages × all layers. ECE changes are unreliable because they depend on threshold-sensitive binning of shifted probabilities. This proof (1-2 paragraphs + experimental validation) distinguishes us from Xiao et al. (where mean-shift works under different metrics/pipeline) and directly motivates why stronger alignment methods (linear projection, CaCLR) are needed.
4. **"Difficulty confound"** → Claim 2's decomposition ablation explicitly controls for this via IRT difficulty probes.
5. **"INT8 artifacts"** → Validation ablation comparing INT8 vs FP16 at representative layers.
6. **"Only MCQA"** → Acknowledged. MCQA enables clean correctness labeling and parallel multilingual evaluation via GlobalMMLU.
7. **"Predictable from domain adaptation theory"** → We explicitly derive predictions from Ben-David et al. (2010) H-divergence framework and test them. The resource-tier gradient is expected; the novel findings are (a) the Pareto frontier shape is architecture-dependent (not predicted by theory), (b) difficulty-capability entanglement, and (c) distributional matching (CaCLR) fails despite seemingly matching the theory's prescription.
8. **"No statistical tests"** → All key comparisons include bootstrap CIs (1000 resamples) and paired permutation tests across languages. Effect sizes reported with Cohen's d.
9. **"Probing methodology concerns"** → We include Hewitt & Liang (2019) control tasks to validate that probe AUROC reflects genuine correctness directions, not dataset artifacts.
10. **"No mechanistic explanation"** → CKA analysis across layers × languages explains WHY transfer fails at deeper layers (cross-lingual representation similarity decreases with depth) and correlates with transfer success.
11. **"Why not conformal prediction?"** → Discussed in Related Work. Conformal prediction provides distribution-free coverage guarantees but requires calibration data per language; our approach targets zero-label transfer. Complementary, not competing.
12. **"CaCLR parallel activations = test leakage?"** → Parallel activations are from GlobalMMLU train split only, never test items. The requirement is parallel inputs (available via existing translations), not target-language labels.

## Additional Related Work Coverage (Dream-identified gaps)
- **Domain adaptation theory**: Ben-David et al. (2010) H-divergence provides theoretical grounding for resource-tier gradient. We derive predictions and test them.
- **Cross-lingual alignment**: MUSE (Conneau et al. 2018), VecMap (Artetxe et al. 2018) — linear projection's effectiveness is consistent with this literature; CaCLR's failure despite distributional matching is the novel finding.
- **Representation similarity**: CKA (Kornblith et al. 2019), SVCCA (Raghu et al. 2017) — we use CKA to provide mechanistic explanation for the Pareto frontier.
- **Probing methodology**: Hewitt & Liang (2019) control tasks, Voita & Titov (2020) MDL probes — we include control tasks to validate probe selectivity.
- **Conformal prediction**: Angelopoulos & Bates (2023) — complementary approach discussed in Related Work; requires per-language calibration data vs our zero-label target.
