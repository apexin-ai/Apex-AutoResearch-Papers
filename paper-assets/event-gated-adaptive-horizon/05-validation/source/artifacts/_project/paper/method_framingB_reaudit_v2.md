# 3. Methodology

We present a systematic diagnostic methodology for identifying why variable-rate imagination fails in world-model reinforcement learning. Our approach combines (i) controlled factorial experiments that isolate individual causal factors, (ii) a normalized diagnostic metric that separates pathological value overestimation from benign overshoot, and (iii) a world-model fidelity analysis that grounds the failure mechanism in prediction error. All experiments use DreamerV3 \citep{hafner2023dreamerv3} on Walker Walk from the DeepMind Control Suite \citep{tassa2018deepmind}; we scope claims to this architecture and report single-environment results throughout.


## 3.1 Background: DreamerV3 and Variable-Rate Imagination

### World-Model Actor-Critic

DreamerV3 \citep{hafner2023dreamerv3} learns a latent dynamics model---the Recurrent State-Space Model (RSSM)---from environment interactions and trains an actor-critic entirely within imagined trajectories. The RSSM maintains a latent state $s_t = (h_t, z_t)$ consisting of a deterministic recurrent component $h_t$ and a stochastic discrete representation $z_t$. At each imagination step, the model predicts:

$$h_{t+1} = f_\theta(h_t, z_t, a_t), \quad \hat{z}_{t+1} \sim p_\theta(\cdot \mid h_{t+1})$$

An actor $\pi_\psi$ selects actions and a critic $V_\xi$ estimates $\lambda$-returns, both trained on imagined trajectories of horizon $H$ steps. In the standard configuration, each imagination step corresponds to one environment transition ($\Delta t = 1$) and $H = 15$.

### Temporal Abstraction via Variable-Rate Imagination

Temporal abstraction---reasoning at multiple timescales---is a longstanding goal in RL \citep{sutton1999options, precup2000temporal}. World-model RL provides a natural setting: by setting the imagination step size $\Delta t > 1$, the agent can plan over longer temporal horizons without increasing the number of imagination steps. An $H$-step rollout at $\Delta t = 2$ covers $2H$ environment steps of lookahead at the same computational cost as the standard $H$-step rollout.

We introduce three modifications to the DreamerV3 imagination pipeline, each independently controllable:

**Temporal step-size embedding.** An embedding $e_{\Delta t} \in \mathbb{R}^d$ conditions the RSSM transition on the step size:

$$h_{t+\Delta t} = f_\theta(h_t, z_t, a_t, e_{\Delta t})$$

We study three configurations: *trained* ($d{=}32$, jointly optimized with the world model), *untrained* ($d{=}32$, randomly initialized and frozen), and *removed* ($d{=}0$, no temporal conditioning). The trained embedding enables the RSSM to specialize predictions for different $\Delta t$ values; the untrained and removed configurations serve as controls.

**Temporal subsampling.** When enabled, the replay buffer stores both $\Delta t{=}1$ and $\Delta t{=}2$ transitions (constructed by skipping alternate frames), exposing the RSSM to multi-rate dynamics during training. When disabled, only $\Delta t{=}1$ transitions are used for world-model training.

**Imagination step size.** During actor-critic optimization, imagination rollouts use a fixed step size: $\Delta t{=}1$ (standard) or $\Delta t{>}1$ (variable-rate). This factor is independently controllable from the world model's training data composition.

### Conditioning-Induced Value Overestimation (CIVO)

When the RSSM predicts $\Delta t > 1$ transitions, it must extrapolate over a larger temporal gap, and state prediction fidelity degrades. With a trained temporal embedding, the critic $V_\xi$ receives precise $\Delta t$ information and can exploit the model's confident but inaccurate multi-step predictions to form systematically optimistic value estimates. If these overestimates persistently exceed achievable returns, the actor pursues policies that are optimal under the model but suboptimal in reality.

We term this *conditioning-induced value overestimation (CIVO)*. The mechanism is analogous to Lu \& Schuurmans' \citep{lu2018nondelusional} delusional policies, where function approximation introduces inconsistencies in Q-learning backups, but the source differs: Lu et al.'s delusions are *policy-class-induced* (the policy's functional form cannot represent consistent backups), whereas CIVO is *model-induced* (the world model's temporal extrapolation error produces systematically biased latent states that the critic treats as accurate). The delusion source is the conditioning signal $e_{\Delta t}$ and the RSSM's degraded fidelity at $\Delta t > 1$, not the policy's representational capacity.


## 3.2 Diagnostic Framework: Normalized Value-Evaluation Ratio

### Motivation

Distinguishing pathological from benign value overestimation is the central diagnostic challenge. Even the standard DreamerV3 baseline exhibits value overshoot during training: at step 25K, the baseline's value-evaluation ratio is 0.087 (exp\_001\_baseline), rising to 0.656 by 105K as the critic converges. Any diagnostic metric must remove this baseline trend to isolate the *excess* overestimation attributable to variable-rate imagination.

### Definition

**Value-evaluation ratio.** At training step $k$:

$$r_k = \frac{\bar{v}_k}{\bar{R}_k}$$

where $\bar{v}_k$ is the mean predicted value across imagined states and $\bar{R}_k$ is the mean evaluation return over 10 episodes. This measures how closely the critic's estimates track achievable performance.

**Normalized value-evaluation ratio (NVE).** We normalize by the baseline's ratio at the same step:

$$\hat{r}_k = \frac{r_k^{\,\text{exp}}}{r_k^{\,\text{baseline}}}$$

This removes the baseline's own overshoot trend, isolating excess overestimation. We normalize all v/e ratios against exp\_001 (DreamerV3 baseline, seed 1) at matched training steps. Sensitivity to baseline choice is reported in Appendix X.

### Diagnostic Thresholds

We calibrate thresholds from the observed separation between experimental conditions. We emphasize that these serve as empirical *markers*, not formal hypothesis tests---they are calibrated and evaluated on the same experiments:

- **$\hat{r}_k > 1.5$ (at $k \geq$ 35K)**: **Pathological overestimation.** The critic overestimates far beyond baseline levels. This threshold achieves 4/4 classification accuracy across available seeds: both trained dt\_embedding conditions exceed 1.5$\times$ at 35K+ steps (exp\_008d seed 1: 1.71$\times$@35K $\to$ 2.09$\times$@45K; exp\_009b seed 2: 1.62$\times$@45K), while neither removed-embedding condition exceeds the threshold (exp\_008f seed 1 peak: 1.02$\times$@25K; exp\_009c seed 2 peak: 1.26$\times$@25K).

- **$0.8 \leq \hat{r}_k \leq 1.2$**: **Normal range.** Value estimates track the baseline's overshoot pattern.

- **$\hat{r}_k < 0.7$**: **Value suppression.** The critic underestimates returns relative to baseline, indicating conservative value learning.

**Temporal validity constraint.** The NVE threshold applies only at $k \geq$ 35K steps, where the baseline $r_k > 0.24$ and ratios are stable. At earlier steps, the small baseline denominator amplifies noise: for example, exp\_009b at 25K shows NVE = 2.05$\times$ and exp\_008e\_v3 at 25K shows NVE = 1.93$\times$, both artifacts of the baseline's $r_{25\text{K}} = 0.087$ rather than genuine pathological overestimation. We report these early-step values for completeness but exclude them from diagnostic classification.

**Aggregate diagnostic power.** Evaluating the 1.5$\times$ threshold across all eight experimental conditions (task B2), the NVE diagnostic achieves AUROC = 0.933 with 7/8 classification accuracy (Table~\ref{tab:nve_sensitivity}). The single false positive is exp\_008e\_v3\_s2, which exhibits late-onset NVE = 3.78$\times$ driven by eval collapse rather than value overestimation---a non-CIVO failure pathway analyzed in \S3.3. At a stricter threshold of 1.7$\times$ (task B1), the metric achieves 8/8 accuracy and AUROC = 1.0 (supplementary material).

### Properties of the NVE Metric

Two properties make NVE informative for detecting the CIVO:

**Acceleration signature.** In pathological conditions, NVE does not merely exceed 1.5$\times$---it *accelerates*, reflecting a positive feedback loop between overestimated values and actor exploitation. Exp\_008d shows NVE = 1.71$\times$@35K $\to$ 2.09$\times$@45K $\to$ 4.12$\times$@55K, with each checkpoint further from baseline. Healthy conditions (exp\_008a, exp\_008f) show stable or declining NVE trajectories.

**Collapse association.** Sustained NVE $>$ 1.5$\times$ across multiple consecutive checkpoints at 35K+ steps is associated with catastrophic performance collapse (exp\_008d seed 1: three consecutive checkpoints above 1.5$\times$, followed by eval return declining from 167 to 83). Transient exceedance followed by self-correction (exp\_009b seed 2: 1.62$\times$@45K $\to$ 1.41$\times$@55K $\to$ 0.94$\times$@65K, declining) does not lead to collapse. This pattern is consistent with a "point of no return" where the overestimation feedback loop becomes self-reinforcing, though with only two seeds under the trained-embedding condition, we report this association descriptively rather than as a statistical claim.


## 3.3 Causal Analysis Protocol

### Design Rationale

This is a diagnostic analysis. Our goal is to identify *which components* of variable-rate imagination cause degradation and trigger pathological overestimation, not to propose a new algorithm. We achieve this through controlled comparisons that vary one factor at a time, holding all others constant.

### Factorial Structure

We vary three factors (temporal embedding type $\times$ subsampling $\times$ horizon) across eight treatment conditions plus a baseline (see Table 1 in \S4 for the complete configuration matrix). Rather than filling all cells of the $3 \times 2 \times 2$ grid, we prioritize the comparisons most informative for causal isolation.

### Causal Chain and Its Tests

The causal chain under investigation is:

$$\text{trained } e_{\Delta t} \;\xrightarrow{\text{Link 1}}\; \text{pathological NVE} \;\xrightarrow{\text{Link 2}}\; \text{actor exploitation} \;\xrightarrow{\text{Link 3}}\; \text{performance collapse}$$

Each link is tested by a specific controlled comparison:

**Link 1: Trained dt\_embedding $\to$ pathological overestimation.** The comparison between exp\_008d (trained dt\_embedding, $d{=}32$) and exp\_008f (removed dt\_embedding, $d{=}0$) isolates the effect of temporal embedding conditioning with all other factors held constant (subsample ON, $H{=}8$, $\Delta t{=}2$ imagination). Exp\_008d exhibits accelerating NVE (1.71$\times$@35K $\to$ 2.09$\times$@45K), while exp\_008f remains in the normal range (0.73$\times$@35K $\to$ 0.83$\times$@45K). This is the primary causal evidence.

**Link 2: Sustained overestimation $\to$ collapse (stochastic).** Multi-seed replication of exp\_008d reveals that the NVE $>$ 1.5$\times$ marker is reliable across seeds (2/2 trained-embedding seeds exceed the threshold at 35K+), but collapse is stochastic: seed 1 (exp\_008d) shows sustained NVE $>$ 1.5$\times$ across three checkpoints and collapses; seed 2 (exp\_009b) shows transient exceedance and self-corrects, with eval return rising from 141@25K to peak 278.5@95K. We report this stochasticity transparently---the diagnostic marker is reliable; collapse is a probabilistic downstream outcome.

**Link 3: Imagination $\Delta t$ as the critical variable.** Exp\_008e\_v3 uses a trained dt\_embedding (identical to exp\_008d and exp\_006) but restricts imagination rollouts to $\Delta t{=}1$, with subsample ON and $H{=}15$. This condition achieves eval return 869.9 at 105K steps (95% of baseline 915.67; exp\_008e\_v3, seed 1) with NVE = 0.80$\times$ (healthy). The contrast with exp\_006 (same trained dt\_embedding, subsample ON, $H{=}15$, but $\Delta t{=}2$ imagination $\to$ collapse at 55K) isolates the imagination step size as the critical variable. The trained embedding does not trigger CIVO when imagination is restricted to $\Delta t{=}1$; the pathological overestimation arises specifically when the actor-critic exploits the embedding's $\Delta t > 1$ predictions during imagination.

### 2$\times$2 Ablation Matrix

To close the causal loop, we cross dt\_embedding configuration (trained / frozen / removed) with temporal subsampling (ON / OFF), isolating the necessary condition for sustained CIVO:

| dt\_embedding | Subsample | Exp | Peak NVE (35K+) | Outcome |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Trained ($d{=}32$) | ON | 008d | 4.12$\times$@55K (sustained $\uparrow$) | CIVO $\to$ collapse |
| Trained ($d{=}32$) | OFF | 008a | 0.93$\times$@55K | Stable, 85\% baseline@105K |
| Frozen ($d{=}32$) | ON | 015b | 1.45$\times$@55K $\to$ 0.65$\times$@65K | Sub-threshold transient; gradient starvation collapse |
| Removed ($d{=}0$) | ON | 008f | $\leq$1.02$\times$ | No CIVO |

A trained dt\_embedding is necessary for sustained CIVO (NVE $>$ 1.5$\times$ across consecutive checkpoints), though not independently sufficient---multi-rate training data exposure is jointly required. Frozen embedding produces sub-threshold transient overestimation (exp\_015b: peak 1.45$\times$@55K) that self-corrects to 0.65$\times$@65K before collapsing through a distinct gradient starvation mechanism (actor loss $\to$ 0 as the frozen embedding drifts from the RSSM's evolving representations). Removing the embedding entirely (exp\_008f, $d{=}0$) blocks CIVO: NVE never exceeds 1.02$\times$. The subsample-OFF condition (exp\_008a) confirms that a trained embedding without exposure to $\Delta t{>}1$ training data also avoids CIVO, establishing that both embedding capacity *and* multi-rate training data are jointly required to trigger the overestimation feedback loop.

### Supporting Analyses

**Horizon effect (C5).** Exp\_008c ($H{=}8$) vs. exp\_008a ($H{=}15$), both with trained-but-unexposed dt\_embedding and subsample OFF, shows that longer imagination horizons improve learning quality independently of the CIVO mechanism (exp\_008a: 778@105K; exp\_008c: 241@65K plateau).

**Temporal distance amplification (C4).** Exp\_006 ($\Delta t{=}2$, peak 485@35K $\to$ collapse) vs. exp\_007 ($\Delta t{=}4$, peak 177@25K, severe degradation) shows monotonic performance decline with increasing $\Delta t$, consistent with compounding RSSM prediction errors. Only two $\Delta t$ values are tested; we report the monotonic trend (dt=1 $\approx$950 $>$ dt=2 peak 485 $>$ dt=4 peak 177) without stronger generalization claims.

### RSSM Fidelity Analysis

To ground the CIVO mechanism in world-model prediction quality, we analyze RSSM fidelity by measuring observation prediction error (MSE) and reward prediction error (MAE) at $\Delta t{=}1$ vs. $\Delta t{=}2$ across three conditions (exp\_rssm\_fidelity\_analysis):

| Condition | $\Delta t{=}1$ obs MSE | $\Delta t{=}2$ obs MSE | Obs gap | $\Delta t{=}1$ rew MAE | $\Delta t{=}2$ rew MAE | Rew gap |
|-----------|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Baseline (exp\_001) | 13.49 | 27.50 | 2.04$\times$ | 0.0102 | 0.0159 | 1.56$\times$ |
| 008d (trained emb) | 41.31 | 53.67 | 1.30$\times$ | 0.0568 | 0.1579 | 2.78$\times$ |
| 008f (no emb) | 8.01 | 22.04 | 2.75$\times$ | 0.7469 | 0.7526 | 1.01$\times$ |

Two patterns are diagnostically relevant:

1. **Trained embedding enables differentiated but biased reward predictions.** In exp\_008d, the reward head produces sharply different predictions for $\Delta t{=}1$ vs. $\Delta t{=}2$ (reward gap 2.78$\times$), but these differentiated predictions rest on poor absolute state quality ($\Delta t{=}1$ obs MSE = 41.31, 3.1$\times$ baseline). The critic receives confident but systematically biased reward signals at $\Delta t{=}2$, fueling value overestimation.

2. **Removing the embedding prevents differentiation but degrades reward quality.** In exp\_008f, the reward head cannot distinguish $\Delta t$ values (gap 1.01$\times$), blocking the systematic bias that drives the CIVO. However, this comes at the cost of severely degraded reward prediction (MAE = 0.747, 73$\times$ baseline). Exp\_008f is therefore a *causal control* that confirms the dt\_embedding's role in overestimation, not a recommended configuration.

**Caveat on obs gap ratios.** Exp\_008d's low obs gap ratio (1.30$\times$) is misleading---its $\Delta t{=}1$ absolute error is already 3.1$\times$ baseline, indicating the model has degraded overall. We report both absolute errors and ratios to avoid ratio-only comparisons that could obscure this.

### Gradient Decomposition of the Temporal Embedding
\label{sec:gradient_decomposition}

To identify which loss component drives $e_{\Delta t}$'s learned representation, we decompose $\nabla_\theta e_{\Delta t}$ by loss term using \texttt{torch.autograd.grad}, measuring each component's gradient norm at step 95K (D061). DreamerV3's joint loss \citep{hafner2023dreamerv3} sums observation reconstruction, reward prediction, continuation, and KL regularization terms; each backpropagates through the shared RSSM latent state to reach $e_{\Delta t}$.

| Loss component | Gradient norm | Share (\%) |
|----------------|:---:|:---:|
| Observation decoders (orientations, velocity, height) | 1.505 | 93 |
| KL dynamics | 0.119 | 7 |
| Continuation head | $<$0.001 | $<$1 |
| Reward head | 0.000 | 0 |

The temporal embedding receives 93\% of its gradient from observation reconstruction and numerically negligible---zero to within floating-point precision---from the reward head (D061). This gradient imbalance is consistent with findings that observation reconstruction dominates reward learning in DreamerV3-type world models \citep{shang2024harmonydream}, and represents an extreme instance of multi-task gradient magnitude imbalance \citep{chen2018gradnorm}. Three implications follow:

1. **Exp\_016e is an architectural no-op.** The reward-only stop-gradient surgery (Section~\ref{sec:sgs_negative}) detaches a gradient that does not exist. Its null effect is structurally determined, not an empirical surprise.

2. **$e_{\Delta t}$ is shaped by observation reconstruction, not reward prediction.** The embedding learns temporal information that helps observation decoders minimize reconstruction error. If this induces systematic biases in latent states at $\Delta t{>}1$---states that are easy to decode but dynamically inaccurate---these biases propagate to all downstream heads, including the critic's value estimates. CIVO thus originates in the observation reconstruction objective, not the reward pathway.

3. **Full SGS is the correct gradient-level intervention.** A meaningful intervention must address the dominant 93\% contribution from observation decoders. This motivates the full SGS design (exp\_018), which detaches $e_{\Delta t}$ from all non-KL gradient pathways.

### Stop-Gradient Surgery: An Informative Negative (exp\_016e)
\label{sec:sgs_negative}

The gradient decomposition above was motivated by a null result: exp\_016e, a reward-only stop-gradient surgery (SGS) that failed to attenuate CIVO. This negative result is informative because it constrains the space of viable interventions and reveals the architectural structure of gradient flow through $e_{\Delta t}$.

**Configuration.** Exp\_016e replicates exp\_008d's CIVO-exhibiting setup (Walker Walk, trained $e_{\Delta t}$, subsampling ON, $H{=}8$, $\Delta t{=}2$ imagination) with one modification: \texttt{reward\_dt\_emb\_detach=True}, which applies $\text{sg}(\cdot)$ to $e_{\Delta t}$ before the reward head during the backward pass.

**Results.** Exp\_016e collapses in the same qualitative pattern as exp\_008d. Peak eval return reaches 326.7 at 75K (exp\_016e), then drops to 31.7 by 95K---a 90.3\% decline. NVE remains in the normal range through 85K, then spikes to 10.42$\times$ at 95K (exp\_016e). The timing difference relative to exp\_008d (which crosses the pathological NVE threshold at 35K) cannot be attributed to the intervention, since the intervention is an architectural no-op (Section~\ref{sec:gradient_decomposition}); seed-level stochasticity is the parsimonious explanation.

**Why this is an architectural no-op.** The gradient decomposition (Table above) shows the reward head contributes zero gradient to $e_{\Delta t}$. Detaching a zero-gradient pathway changes nothing. The reward head's negligible contribution arises from DreamerV3's architecture: the observation decoders' high-dimensional output space (24 dimensions vs.\ 1 scalar reward) dominates the gradient signal to $e_{\Delta t}$ by two orders of magnitude.

**Implication for intervention design.** Any strategy targeting the reward head alone---reward prediction regularization, reward-conditioned value clipping, or reward-pathway stop-gradient---addresses $<$1\% of the gradient flow to $e_{\Delta t}$ and is unlikely to mitigate CIVO. Effective interventions must operate on the observation reconstruction pathway, either by modifying gradient flow (full SGS, exp\_018) or by restructuring how $e_{\Delta t}$ interacts with the RSSM transition function.

### Imagination Step Size as Causal Variable

The factorial analysis isolates the imagination step size as the causal variable that triggers CIVO. Two lines of evidence support this:

**$\Delta t{=}1$ imagination removes CIVO (seed 1).** Exp\_008e\_v3 uses the same trained dt\_embedding and multi-rate training data as exp\_008d (the primary CIVO-exhibiting condition), but restricts imagination rollouts to $\Delta t{=}1$ with $H{=}15$. At 105K steps, it achieves eval return 869.9 (exp\_008e\_v3, seed 1), 95\% of baseline (exp\_001\_baseline: 915.67@105K), with NVE = 0.80$\times$ (healthy range). The trained embedding does not trigger CIVO when imagination is restricted to $\Delta t{=}1$; the pathological overestimation arises only when the actor-critic exploits $\Delta t > 1$ predictions during imagination.

**$\Delta t{=}1$ imagination does not prevent all failure modes (seed 2).** Exp\_008e\_v3\_s2 replicates the same configuration with seed 2 and exhibits catastrophic collapse: eval return peaks at 715 early in training, then declines to 137 by 105K steps (exp\_008e\_v3\_s2), with NVE = 3.78$\times$ at the final checkpoint. This collapse co-occurs with rising entropy (exp\_008e\_v3\_s2), contrasting with the entropy-decreasing, value-driven collapse signature of CIVO in exp\_008d.

**Dual-pathway analysis.** The seed-1 vs. seed-2 divergence reveals two distinct failure pathways:

- *Pathway A (CIVO):* Trained dt\_embedding + $\Delta t{>}1$ imagination $\to$ value overestimation (NVE $\uparrow$) $\to$ actor over-exploitation (entropy $\downarrow$) $\to$ performance collapse. Observed in exp\_008d (seed 1) and exp\_009b (seed 2, transient).

- *Pathway B (non-CIVO):* $\Delta t{=}1$ imagination, no value overestimation trigger, but eval-driven collapse with entropy increase. Observed in exp\_008e\_v3\_s2 (seed 2). The rising entropy signature suggests exploration failure or policy instability unrelated to the CIVO mechanism.

To rule out seed fragility as the explanation for Pathway B, we verify that the baseline is stable at seed 2: exp\_009a (DreamerV3 baseline, seed 2) achieves eval return 911.2 at 105K steps (exp\_009a), comparable to seed 1's 915.67 (exp\_001\_baseline). The collapse in exp\_008e\_v3\_s2 is therefore attributable to the interaction between multi-rate training and seed-specific dynamics, not to inherent instability at seed 2.

**Implication.** Restricting imagination to $\Delta t{=}1$ eliminates Pathway A (CIVO) but does not guarantee stable training. The $\Delta t{=}1$ configuration is a *diagnostic control* confirming the causal role of imagination step size, not a robust mitigation strategy.
