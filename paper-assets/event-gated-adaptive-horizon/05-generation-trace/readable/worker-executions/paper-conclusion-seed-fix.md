1	\section{Conclusion}
2	\label{sec:conclusion}
3	
4	We have presented a systematic factorial diagnostic of temporal abstraction in DreamerV3 across two continuous-control environments. The analysis identifies the combination of trained $\dt$-embedding and multi-rate data exposure as the causal factor behind conditioning-induced value overestimation (CIVO). The key findings are:
5	
6	\begin{enumerate}[nosep,leftmargin=*]
7	\item Every variable-rate imagination configuration degrades relative to the $\dt{=}1$ baseline, with degradation scaling monotonically with $\dt$.
8	\item A normalized value-to-eval threshold of $\nve \geq 1.5\times$ (35K+ window) achieves 11/12 CIVO classification ($n{=}12$, 91.7\%), with the single false positive arising from a mechanistically distinct non-CIVO collapse. The combination of trained $\dt$-embedding and multi-rate data exposure is the causal factor; unexposed, frozen, or removed embeddings prevent overestimation.
9	\item The RSSM reward head develops a $2.78\times$ prediction gap between $\dt{=}1$ and $\dt{=}2$ under trained conditioning. This systematic bias drives critic overestimation.
10	\item The same CIVO trigger produces stochastic downstream outcomes (full collapse and transient CIVO with self-correction) across seeds of identical configurations.
11	\item Restricting imagination to $\dt{=}1$ does not fully prevent collapse: one of two seeds fails via a qualitatively distinct non-CIVO pathway (eval-driven with increasing entropy). This shows that the trained $\dt$-embedding creates vulnerability through multiple mechanisms.
12	\item A lightweight online detector that monitors the dynamics of the value-to-evaluation ratio identifies CIVO onset with 100\% sensitivity across three positive cases, with predictive detection (alert before performance degradation) in two of three. A timing guideline ($<$70K steps = high confidence) separates genuine CIVO from late-stage false positives.
13	\end{enumerate}
14	
15	The contrast with TAWM's success in MPC identifies the feedback architecture as the critical factor: $\dt$-conditioning succeeds when errors are contained by re-planning from real states, but fails when errors compound through imagination-based actor-critic bootstrapping.
16	
17	\paragraph{Limitations.}
18	Our primary factorial analysis focuses on Walker Walk; cross-environment evidence (Cheetah Run) is limited to a single seed. Both use a single world-model architecture (DreamerV3/RSSM). Generalization to other environments and architectures, particularly transformer-based world models such as DreamerV4, remains an open question. The $\nve$ threshold ($1.5\times$, 35K+ window) is sensitive to value overestimation broadly but not perfectly specific to CIVO (11/12, one non-CIVO false positive); generalization to other tasks and architectures is pending validation. The detector's thresholds were calibrated on eleven runs across three environments; generalization to different reward scales and architectures requires further validation.
19	
20	\paragraph{Future directions.}
21	Our findings suggest three avenues. First, hierarchical temporal abstraction at the representation level (as in THICK and Hieros) may avoid the flat-conditioning failure mode by maintaining separate dynamics for each temporal scale. Second, gradient decomposition reveals that gradient importance is decoupled from magnitude: the reward head provides the largest share (38--49\%) but reward-only SGS fails, while the observation decoder channel (16--22\%) carries the critical $\dt$-specific information driving the fidelity gap. Full-pathway gradient stopping \sgsclaim{} (seed~1 eval \sgseval{}, seed~2 collapsed). Cutting the observation decoder gradient pathway is thus necessary but not sufficient; the 50\% recovery rate points to redundant mechanisms in CIVO's feedback loop that future interventions must address jointly. Third, extending this diagnostic framework to transformer-based world models and continuous-control benchmarks would clarify whether CIVO is RSSM-specific or a broader vulnerability of temporal conditioning in imagination-based RL. Fourth, our findings suggest that freezing the temporal embedding while allowing the gate mechanism to learn (untrained embedding with adaptive horizon selection) may decouple the benefits of temporal abstraction from the CIVO vulnerability, a direction we are actively investigating.

_source line 11_

Line 18 contains the relevant text. The sentence reads: "cross-environment evidence (Cheetah Run) is limited to a single seed."

Since Cheetah now has 2 seeds confirming CIVO, I need to update this.

    "originalFile": "\\section{Conclusion}\n\\label{sec:conclusion}\n\nWe have presented a systematic factorial diagnostic of temporal abstraction in DreamerV3 across two continuous-control environments. The analysis identifies the combination of trained $\\dt$-embedding and multi-rate data exposure as the causal factor behind conditioning-induced value overestimation (CIVO). The key findings are:\n\n\\begin{enumerate}[nosep,leftmargin=*]\n\\item Every variable-rate imagination configuration degrades relative to the $\\dt{=}1$ baseline, with degradation scaling monotonically with $\\dt$.\n\\item A normalized value-to-eval threshold of $\\nve \\geq 1.5\\times$ (35K+ window) achieves 11/12 CIVO classification ($n{=}12$, 91.7\\%), with the single false positive arising from a mechanistically distinct non-CIVO collapse. The combination of trained $\\dt$-embedding and multi-rate data exposure is the causal factor; unexposed, frozen, or removed embeddings prevent overestimation.\n\\item The RSSM reward head develops a $2.78\\times$ prediction gap between $\\dt{=}1$ and $\\dt{=}2$ under trained conditioning. This systematic bias drives critic overestimation.\n\\item The same CIVO trigger produces stochastic downstream outcomes (full collapse and transient CIVO with self-correction) across seeds of identical configurations.\n\\item Restricting imagination to $\\dt{=}1$ does not fully prevent collapse: one of two seeds fails via a qualitatively distinct non-CIVO pathway (eval-driven with increasing entropy). This shows that the trained $\\dt$-embedding creates vulnerability through multiple mechanisms.\n\\item A lightweight online detector that monitors the dynamics of the value-to-evaluation ratio identifies CIVO onset with 100\\% sensitivity across three positive cases, with predictive detection (alert before performance degradation) in two of three. A timing guideline ($<$70K steps = high confidence) separates genuine CIVO from late-stage false positives.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\nThe contrast with TAWM's success in MPC identifies the feedback architecture as the critical factor: $\\dt$-conditioning succeeds when errors are contained by re-planning from real states, but fails when errors compound through imagination-based actor-critic bootstrapping.\n\n\\paragraph{Limitations.}\nOur primary factorial analysis focuses on Walker Walk; cross-environment evidence (Cheetah Run) is limited to a single seed. Both use a single world-model architecture (DreamerV3/RSSM). Generalization to other environments and architectures, particularly transformer-based world models such as DreamerV4, remains an open question. The $\\nve$ threshold ($1.5\\times$, 35K+ window) is sensitive to value overestimation broadly but not perfectly specific to CIVO (11/12, one non-CIVO false positive); generalization to other tasks and architectures is pending validation. The detector's thresholds were calibrated on eleven runs across three environments; generalization to different reward scales and architectures requires further validation.\n\n\\paragraph{Future directions.}\nOur findings suggest three avenues. First, hierarchical temporal abstraction at the representation level (as in THICK and Hieros) may avoid the flat-conditioning failure mode by maintaining separate dynamics for each temporal scale. Second, gradient decomposition reveals that gradient importance is decoupled from magnitude: the reward head provides the largest share (38--49\\%) but reward-only SGS fails, while the observation decoder channel (16--22\\%) carries the critical $\\dt$-specific information driving the fidelity gap. Full-pathway gradient stopping \\sgsclaim{} (seed~1 eval \\sgseval{}, seed~2 collapsed). Cutting the observation decoder gradient pathway is thus necessary but not sufficient; the 50\\% recovery rate points to redundant mechanisms in CIVO's feedback loop that future interventions must address jointly. Third, extending this diagnostic framework to transformer-based world models and continuous-control benchmarks would clarify whether CIVO is RSSM-specific or a broader vulnerability of temporal conditioning in imagination-based RL. Fourth, our findings suggest that freezing the temporal embedding while allowing the gate mechanism to learn (untrained embedding with adaptive horizon selection) may decouple the benefits of temporal abstraction from the CIVO vulnerability, a direction we are actively investigating.\n",
