\subsection{Selective Gradient Stopping and Gradient Decomposition}
\label{sec:sgs_gradient_analysis}

\subsubsection{Design and Hypothesis}
\label{sec:sgs_design}

The preceding analysis establishes that a trained temporal embedding $e_{\Delta t}$ is necessary for CIVO (Section~\ref{sec:civo_mechanism}). We next ask \textit{which gradient pathway} through $e_{\Delta t}$ amplifies the overestimation. In DreamerV3, the temporal embedding conditions all prediction heads simultaneously through the RSSM latent state. A natural hypothesis is that the \textit{reward head}---which directly supplies $\lambda$-return targets to the critic---is the primary amplifier: if reward predictions develop $\Delta t$-dependent biases, the critic inherits and compounds these biases across the $H$-step imagination rollout.

To test this, we introduce \textit{selective gradient stopping} (SGS): during the backward pass, $e_{\Delta t}$ is detached before entering the reward head,
$$\hat{r}_t = f_{\text{reward}}\big(\operatorname{sg}(e_{\Delta t}),\; h_t,\; z_t\big),$$
where $\operatorname{sg}(\cdot)$ denotes the stop-gradient operator. This prevents reward-loss gradients from updating $e_{\Delta t}$'s parameters while preserving the embedding's forward-pass contribution. All other gradient pathways---observation decoders, continuation predictor, KL dynamics---remain intact. We apply this intervention to the primary CIVO-exhibiting configuration: Walker Walk, trained $e_{\Delta t}$ ($d{=}32$), subsampling enabled, $H{=}8$, $\Delta t{=}2$ imagination (exp\_016e; identical to exp\_008d except for \texttt{reward\_dt\_emb\_detach=True}).


\subsubsection{Gradient Decomposition Reveals the Reward Pathway is Inactive}
\label{sec:gradient_decomposition}

Exp\_016e collapses in the same qualitative pattern as the unmodified control: peak evaluation 326.7 at 75K steps (exp\_016e) followed by catastrophic decline to 31.7 at 95K, with NVE reaching $10.42\times$ (exp\_016e). The SGS intervention neither prevented nor attenuated CIVO.

To explain this null result, we performed a gradient decomposition analysis using \texttt{torch.autograd.grad} to measure each loss component's contribution to $\nabla_\theta e_{\Delta t}$, where $\theta$ denotes the temporal embedding parameters (D061). Table~\ref{tab:gradient_decomposition} reports the results.

\end{table}

The reward head contributes \textit{numerically negligible---zero to within floating-point precision} gradient to the temporal embedding. Exp\_016e's stop-gradient intervention detaches a gradient pathway that carries no signal---it is an architectural no-op. The null result is therefore expected: the intervention removes nothing.

The zero reward gradient is a consequence of the relative output dimensionality. All decoder losses backpropagate through the same RSSM latent state to reach $e_{\Delta t}$. The observation decoders reconstruct a 24-dimensional proprioceptive signal (14 orientations, 9 velocities, 1 height), while the reward head predicts a single scalar. This ${\sim}24\!\times$ dimensionality asymmetry, compounded by DreamerV3's symlog reward scaling which further compresses the reward gradient magnitude, renders the reward head's contribution numerically negligible---zero to within floating-point precision.


\subsubsection{Implications for the CIVO Mechanism}
\label{sec:sgs_implications}

The gradient decomposition reframes the mechanistic understanding of how the temporal embedding drives CIVO.

\paragraph{Observation reconstruction dominates temporal embedding learning.} The temporal embedding's parameters are shaped almost entirely (93\%) by the observation reconstruction objective (D061). This means $e_{\Delta t}$ learns to encode temporal information that helps minimize \textit{observation prediction error}, not reward prediction error. If this learned representation introduces systematic biases in latent state predictions at $\Delta t{>}1$---for instance, by encouraging the RSSM to produce states that are easy to decode but dynamically inaccurate---these biases propagate to \textit{all} downstream computation, including reward prediction and the critic's value estimates. CIVO thus originates in the observation reconstruction objective's influence on latent dynamics, not in reward-specific pathways.

\paragraph{Reframing the intervention target.} Any gradient-level strategy that targets the reward head alone---reward prediction regularization, reward-conditioned value clipping, or the reward-only SGS tested here---addresses $<$1\% of the gradient flow to $e_{\Delta t}$ and cannot attenuate CIVO. Effective gradient-level interventions must address the dominant observation decoder pathway. This motivates the \textit{full-pathway SGS} design (exp\_018): detaching $e_{\Delta t}$ from all decoder and reward gradients, retaining only the 7\% KL dynamics contribution. Full-pathway SGS removes 93\% of the gradient to $e_{\Delta t}$, constituting a genuine gradient-level intervention rather than the null operation of reward-only SGS.

\paragraph{Connection to RSSM fidelity analysis.} The observation-dominated gradient structure is consistent with the RSSM fidelity results in Table~\ref{tab:rssm_fidelity}: the trained-embedding condition (exp\_008d) shows a $2.78\times$ reward gap between $\Delta t{=}1$ and $\Delta t{=}2$ transitions, despite the reward head receiving zero gradient from $e_{\Delta t}$. This confirms that the reward head's $\Delta t$-dependent biases are inherited \textit{through the latent state}---which is shaped by observation reconstruction gradients---rather than learned directly from the reward objective.


\subsubsection{Exp\_016e Reinterpreted as Stochastic Variation}
\label{sec:016e_reinterp}

With the gradient decomposition establishing that exp\_016e is a no-op intervention, the apparent timing differences between exp\_016e and exp\_008d---later collapse onset (75K vs.\ 25K) and higher peak evaluation (326.7 vs.\ 167.2)---must be attributed to stochastic variation rather than SGS effects. This attribution is consistent with the seed-to-seed variability already observed within the trained-embedding condition: exp\_009b (same configuration as exp\_008d, seed 2) reaches peak evaluation 278.5 at 95K (exp\_009b) with transient NVE of $1.62\times$ at 45K before self-correcting, compared to exp\_008d's monotonic collapse from 25K. The qualitative diversity between exp\_008d (early collapse), exp\_009b (self-correction), and exp\_016e (delayed collapse) falls within the range of stochastic outcomes for a single trained-$e_{\Delta t}$ configuration.

All three trajectories share the invariant identified by the NVE diagnostic: each crosses the $1.5\times$ pathological threshold at some point during training (exp\_008d at 35K: $1.71\times$; exp\_009b at 45K: $1.62\times$; exp\_016e at 95K: $10.42\times$). Whether this pathological overestimation leads to sustained collapse or transient recovery depends on early training stochasticity, not on the reward-only SGS intervention (D061).
