[截断: 输出过长，省略 1589 字符] ...\\n\\nt with a performance limit associated with the high trace truncation rate (\\\\S\\\\ref{sec:cross_model})---the model progressively extracts signal from samples with intact trace content but cannot fully compensate for the information loss in the truncated majority.\\nThe 84.45\\\\% accuracy reflects a combination of trace information loss and model capability constraints.\\n\\n\\\\subsection{Error Analysis}\\n\\\\label{sec:error_analysis}\\n\\nSeed robustness testing revealed that the two errors made by \\\\texttt{exception\\\\_only} (accuracy = 99.83\\\\%, 2/1190 incorrect) are \\\\emph{identical across all three seeds} (42, 123, 456).\\nBoth errors are false negatives on samples involving the \\\\texttt{check\\\\_dict\\\\_case} function (sample IDs 901 and 905): the ground truth is \\\\texttt{pass}, but the model predicts \\\\texttt{fail}.\\nThis 100\\\\% error overlap ($\\\\sigma{=}0$) across seeds demonstrates that these are not stochastic training artifacts but \\\\emph{irreducible samples} at the boundary of what exception-based trace signals can resolve.\\n\\nManual inspection reveals the root cause: \\\\texttt{check\\\\_dict\\\\_case} (HumanEval/95) uses \\\\texttt{all()} over a generator expression, and Python's \\\\texttt{all()} short-circuits on the first \\\\texttt{True} value, raising \\\\texttt{GeneratorExit} to terminate the generator.\\nBecause \\\\texttt{GeneratorExit} is a \\\\texttt{BaseException} subclass, the tracer records it as seven \\\\texttt{[ERROR] GeneratorExit} lines---even though the function executes correctly and the test passes.\\nThe model observes these spurious error markers and reasonably but incorrectly predicts \\\\texttt{fail}.\\nThis is not a model failure but a \\\\emph{representation ceiling}: the \\\\texttt{exception\\\\_only} format cannot distinguish genuine exceptions from benign \\\\texttt{BaseException} subclasses triggered by Python's iterator protocol.\\nThe 99.83\\\\% accuracy is therefore a deterministic upper bound for this trace representation on this dataset, not an indication of insufficient model capacity.\\n\\n\\\\subsection{Limitations}\\n\\nOur study has several limitations.\\nFirst, all experiments use a single dataset (591 problems from HumanEval and MBPP-sanitized); generalization to other languages, larger codebases, or different fault types remains untested.\\nSecond, we evaluate only two models at the 7B parameter scale; the relationship between model size and trace signal utility is unexplored.\\nThird, DeepSeek \\\\texttt{exception\\\\_only} exhibits seed-dependent variance: 2/3 seeds achieve 99.33\\\\% while seed 123 yields 91.09\\\\% ($\\\\sigma{=}4.76$pp, $n{=}3$), attributable to LoRA initialization sensitivity (fail recall = 70.5\\\\% for the outlier vs.\\\\ 100\\\\% for others).\\nQwen shows perfect seed robustness ($\\\\sigma{=}0$, $n{=}3$).\\nWhether training stabilization techniques (e.g., larger warmup ratio, LoRA rank adjustment) can eliminate DeepSeek's seed sensitivity is unexplored.\\nOther conditions use a single seed.\\nFourth, the initial DeepSeek \\\\texttt{full\\\\_trace} run was invalidated by context overflow (the DeepSeek tokenizer produced sequences exceeding 2{,}048 tokens, truncating the verdict label); a re-run with label-preserving truncation yields 79.16\\\\% (CI [76.80\\\\%, 81.30\\\\%]), 2.60pp below Qwen (Table~\\\\ref{tab:cross_model}).\\nFifth, the candidate solutions were generated by Qwen-2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct, which also serves as one of our evaluation models.\\nThis does not affect verdict prediction---the task is to classify a \\\\emph{given} solution as pass or fail, not to generate solutions---but we note the overlap for transparency.\\nMoreover, the pass/fail distribution in the dataset is determined by the generating model's coding ability; a stronger or weaker generator would yield a different class balance, potentially affecting task difficulty and the generalizability of our accuracy estimates.\\nFinally, our analysis is limited to verdict prediction; whether exception dominance extends to other classification tasks (vulnerability detection, clone detection) or to generation tasks (program repair) is an open question.\", \"stderr\": \"\", \"return_code\": 0}, \"error\": null, \"metadata\": {\"elapsed_seconds\": 1.45}}"}

```text
I have the full discussion.tex content. Now I need to add a new subsection about max_length sensitivity analysis. Looking at the structure:

1. Why Exception Events Dominate
2. Simplicity as Relative Robustness
3. Training Dynamics and Loss Decoupling
4. Error Analysis
5. Limitations

The best place to add this would be before "Limitations" — as a new subsection on sensitivity/robustness analysis. Let me craft the paragraph and insert it.

Let me write the new subsection. I'll place it right before \subsection{Limitations}.

There's already a "Sensitivity to Evaluation Context Length" subsection (line 51) that covers essentially the same content. My newly added "Sensitivity to Inference Sequence Length" (line 74) is redundant. I need to remove the duplicate I just added.

Let me look at the existing section more carefully. It already covers:
- full_trace: 79.16% → 28.49% collapse
- VOTA: front-truncation removing Answer: suffix → 16%
- exception_only: immune, 99.33%

My new section says the same things. I should remove my addition since it's already there.

### Assistant

_source line 34_

已回滚。现有的 `\subsection{Sensitivity to Evaluation Context Length}` 已经覆盖了所有要求的内容：

- **full_trace 高度敏感**：79.16% → 28.49%，100% 预测 fail，因为模型学了 2048 截断 pattern
- **VOTA 脆弱但原因不同**：前截断删除 "Answer:" suffix，16.0%
- **exception_only 完全免疫**：median 314 tokens，任何 max_length 下不变
- **DeepSeek 特异性**：Qwen 不受影响
- **结论**：simpler, shorter signals are more robust

无需重复添加。该子节已经存在且完整。
