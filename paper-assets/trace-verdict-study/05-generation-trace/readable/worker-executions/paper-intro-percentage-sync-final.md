{"result":"{\"success\": true, \"data\": {\"stdout\": \"\\\\section{Introduction}\\n\\nExecution traces (line-by-line records of a program's runtime behavior) have emerged as a promising input modality for code language models \\\\citep{chen2025tracepile,ding2024traced,wang2025dcsh,ni2024next}.\\nYet feeding thousands of trace lines to a model can be no better than feeding none: the diagnostic signal drowns in routine execution steps.\\n\\\\emph{Which trace components actually carry the signal that matters?}\\n\\nPrior work found no single trace representation consistently outperforms others \\\\citep{wang2025dcsh}, but focused on generation-oriented tasks.\\n\\\\emph{Verdict prediction}---classifying whether a test passes or fails---offers a cleaner testbed: as binary classification, it isolates the learning signal from generation noise, enabling controlled component ablation.\\nAs fault detection, the model need not simulate execution, only determine whether something went wrong---and if that signal is concentrated in a small trace subset, information density should matter more than quantity.\\nThe core question driving our study is counter-intuitive: \\\\emph{why do richer execution traces hurt model performance?}\\n\\nWe test this hypothesis through the first systematic component ablation of trace representations for verdict prediction.\\nUsing 591 problems from HumanEval \\\\citep{chen2021evaluating} and MBPP-sanitized \\\\citep{austin2021program}, we decompose a multi-component trace representation (VOTA: exception events + assertion-point comparisons + loop compression) into individual components across four models spanning 1.5B to 13B parameters and three architecture families: Qwen-2.5-Coder-7B/1.5B-Instruct \\\\citep{qwen2025coder}, CodeLlama-13B-Instruct \\\\citep{roziere2024code}, and DeepSeek-Coder-6.7B-Instruct \\\\citep{deepseek2024coder}.\\nThe results are striking: complete traces (76--82\\\\%; \\\\S\\\\ref{sec:trace_length}) underperform a single compact component (${\\\\geq}$99\\\\%) despite containing strictly more information---a direct demonstration that information density, not quantity, strongly correlates with learning efficiency.\\n\\n\\\\textbf{Exception events alone achieve ${\\\\geq}$99.33\\\\% verdict accuracy across all four models and all seeds tested} (\\\\S\\\\ref{sec:cross_model}).\\nThis near-perfect accuracy holds from 1.5B to 13B parameters, while the code-only baseline (\\\\texttt{no\\\\_trace}) varies from 72.4\\\\% to 76.5\\\\%.\\nTraining dynamics confirm the density hypothesis: high-density inputs converge rapidly and stably, while verbose traces oscillate without reaching stable accuracy even when gradient dilution is eliminated (Figure~\\\\ref{fig:training_dynamics}).\\n\\nAdding trace information beyond exceptions provides no benefit: VOTA (${\\\\geq}$98.57\\\\% across all models, excluding outlier seeds) slightly underperforms \\\\texttt{exception\\\\_only} on Qwen-7B (99.05\\\\% vs.\\\\ 99.83\\\\%), with both conditions achieving near-ceiling accuracy across architectures.\\nThe performance gap approximately decomposes into information overload (${\\\\sim}$76\\\\%) and gradient dilution (${\\\\sim}$24\\\\%) on Qwen-7B (3 seeds).\\nA tail-truncation budget sweep across four models reveals a phase transition at ${\\\\sim}$500 tokens, with \\\\texttt{tail\\\\_2048} recovering 95--98\\\\% of \\\\texttt{exception\\\\_only}'s accuracy.\\nEven on silent logic errors (55.5\\\\% of failures), \\\\texttt{exception\\\\_only} maintains 100\\\\% recall because test assertions generate exception events.\\n\\nOur contributions:\\n\\\\begin{enumerate}\\n\\\\item \\\\textbf{Information density strongly correlates with SFT learning efficiency}: training dynamics directly show that denser trace components learn faster and more stably---\\\\texttt{exception\\\\_only} converges within 50 steps while \\\\texttt{full\\\\_trace} with label-only loss oscillates (82--89\\\\%) without stable convergence. Seed variance negatively correlates with input density ($\\\\sigma{=}$0.00 for \\\\texttt{exception\\\\_only} to 4.48 for \\\\texttt{no\\\\_trace}), and SFT closes a 6--49pp zero-shot gap across all models (\\\\S\\\\ref{sec:ablation}, Appendix~\\\\ref{sec:training_dynamics}).\\n\\\\item \\\\textbf{Exception events are the minimal sufficient signal}: ${\\\\geq}$99.33\\\\% across all four models and all seeds tested (1.5B--13B, three families), with ${\\\\sim}$91\\\\% semantic rather than format-driven (\\\\S\\\\ref{sec:cross_model}, \\\\S\\\\ref{sec:nomarker}). Cross-dataset evaluation on DebugBench ($N{=}426$) preserves the ranking, though margins narrow from ceiling effects (\\\\S\\\\ref{sec:debugbench}).\\n\\\\item \\\\textbf{Preliminary analysis of the full-trace performance gap}: We provide a preliminary analysis on the Qwen-2.5-Coder-7B model (with 1.5B corroboration) showing the gap approximately decomposes into gradient dilution (${\\\\sim}$17--24\\\\%) and information overload (${\\\\sim}$76--83\\\\%), suggesting content selection may matter more than loss engineering. A budget sweep across four models reveals a phase transition at ${\\\\sim}$500 tail tokens (\\\\S\\\\ref{sec:density}, \\\\S\\\\ref{sec:trace_length}).\\n\\\\item \\\\textbf{Consistent two-tier pattern across four models}: We observe that Tier~1 signals (exceptions, assertions) achieve ${\\\\geq}$99.33\\\\% across all four models, while Tier~2 (loop compression) is model-dependent: Qwen +10.9/+7.2pp (7B/1.5B), DeepSeek +7.0pp, CodeLlama +0.9pp over no trace (\\\\S\\\\ref{sec:ablation}).\\n\\\\end{enumerate}\\n\", \"stderr\": \"\", \"return_code\": 0}, \"error\": null, \"metadata\": {\"elapsed_seconds\": 1.19}}"}

Let me find the exact lines that need to be changed. Looking at the output:

Line ~29 (L29 area): `The performance gap approximately decomposes into information overload (${\\sim}$76\\%) and gradient dilution (${\\sim}$24\\%) on Qwen-7B (3 seeds).`

And the contribution item 3: `gradient dilution (${\\sim}$17--24\\%) and information overload (${\\sim}$76--83\\%)`

So the user wants to change:
1. `~24\%/~76\%` → `~26\%/~74\%` - this is in the paragraph about "The performance gap approximately decomposes into information overload (~76%) and gradient dilution (~24%)"


2. `~17--24\%/~76--83\%` → `~17--26\%/~74--83\%` - this is in contribution item 3

For the first change, I need to replace `information overload (${\sim}$76\%) and gradient dilution (${\sim}$24\%)` with `information overload (${\sim}$74\%) and gradient dilution (${\sim}$26\%)`

For the second change, I need to replace `gradient dilution (${\sim}$17--24\%) and information overload (${\sim}$76--83\%)` with `gradient dilution (${\sim}$17--26\%) and information overload (${\sim}$74--83\%)`

Now I'll construct the sed commands to make these replacements.

Writing sed commands...

确认了文本内容。需要修改两处：

1. `information overload (${\sim}$76\%)` → `74\%`，`gradient dilution (${\sim}$24\%)` → `26\%`
2. 贡献第3条中 `$17--24\%` → `$17--26\%`，`$76--83\%` → `$74--83\%`

Hmm, the sed command might not have worked because of the escaping. Let me verify by reading the file again. Actually, the escaping in the sed command is tricky because of all the special characters. Let me take a different approach - use a simpler pattern to match.

Actually, let me just check if the change was made:

```text
The previous sed didn't work. The lines still have the old values. Let me use a simpler sed pattern. The issue is the escaping. Let me write the sed commands more carefully.

Line 21 has: `information overload (${\sim}$76\%) and gradient dilution (${\sim}$24\%)`
Need to change to: `information overload (${\sim}$74\%) and gradient dilution (${\sim}$26\%)`

Line 29 has: `gradient dilution (${\sim}$17--24\%) and information overload (${\sim}$76--83\%)`


Need to change to: `gradient dilution (${\sim}$17--26\%) and information overload (${\sim}$74--83\%)`

I think the best approach here is to target specific line numbers with simpler sed patterns that avoid the escaping issues, or switch to Python for more straightforward string replacement.
