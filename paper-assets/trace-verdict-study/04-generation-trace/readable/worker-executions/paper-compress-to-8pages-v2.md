18	\begin{abstract}
19	Execution traces are increasingly used to enhance code language models, but which trace components matter for downstream tasks remains poorly understood.
20	We present the first systematic component ablation of trace representations for \emph{verdict prediction}---classifying whether a test passes or fails---across two models (Qwen-2.5-Coder-7B and DeepSeek-Coder-6.7B).
21	Our key finding is that exception events alone achieve near-perfect accuracy on Qwen (99.83\% $\pm$ 0.00, 3 seeds) and are the most effective component on DeepSeek (2/3 seeds at 99.33\%; 1 outlier at 91.09\% from LoRA initialization sensitivity), while a multi-component representation (VOTA) degrades by 14.96pp on the weaker model, confounded by training-time trace truncation.
22	We decompose the gap between full traces and compressed representations into gradient dilution (26\%) and information overload (74\%), establishing that irrelevant trace content---not training signal quality---is the primary bottleneck.
23	Component ablation reveals a two-tier diagnostic hierarchy: Tier~1 signals (exception events, assertion points) individually achieve ${\geq}$99.8\% accuracy, while Tier~2 signals (loop compression) reach only 85.6\%.
24	These results reframe verdict prediction as fault detection, where the minimal sufficient signal is a compact exception event that transfers well across model families; training stability is a secondary factor for smaller models.

34	\section*{Limitations}
35	
36	Our study has several limitations.
37	First, our primary experiments use a single dataset (591 problems from HumanEval and MBPP-sanitized); while a cross-dataset evaluation on DebugBench (\S\ref{sec:debugbench}) confirms that exception dominance generalizes to synthetically injected bugs, generalization to other languages, larger codebases, or real-world fault distributions remains untested.
38	Second, we evaluate only two models at the 7B parameter scale; the relationship between model size and trace signal utility is unexplored.
39	Third, DeepSeek \texttt{exception\_only} exhibits seed-dependent variance: 2/3 seeds achieve 99.33\% while seed 123 yields 91.09\% ($\sigma{=}4.76$pp, $n{=}3$), attributable to LoRA initialization sensitivity (fail recall = 70.5\% for the outlier vs.\ 100\% for others).
40	Qwen shows perfect seed robustness ($\sigma{=}0$, $n{=}3$).
41	Whether training stabilization techniques can eliminate DeepSeek's seed sensitivity is unexplored; other conditions use a single seed.
42	Fourth, the initial DeepSeek \texttt{full\_trace} run was invalidated by context overflow; a re-run with extended context yields 79.16\% (CI [76.80\%, 81.30\%]), 2.60pp below Qwen (Table~\ref{tab:cross_model}).
43	Fifth, the candidate solutions were generated by Qwen-2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct, which also serves as one of our evaluation models; this does not affect verdict prediction but may influence the pass/fail distribution.
44	Finally, our analysis is limited to verdict prediction; whether exception dominance extends to other classification tasks or generation tasks is an open question.
45	
46	\section*{Ethics Statement}
47	
48	This work uses publicly available benchmarks (HumanEval, MBPP-sanitized, DebugBench) and does not involve human subjects, crowdsourced annotations, or personally identifiable information.
49	All models evaluated are open-source and publicly accessible.
50	Training uses parameter-efficient LoRA fine-tuning on two RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell GPUs, with each experiment using a single GPU and total compute under 20 GPU-hours across all experiments, resulting in minimal environmental impact.
51	We do not foresee direct negative societal impacts from this work; verdict prediction is a developer-facing tool for automated testing.

1	\section{Introduction}
2	
3	Execution traces---line-by-line records of a program's runtime behavior---have emerged as a promising input modality for code language models \citep{chen2025tracepile,ding2024traced,wang2025dcsh,ni2024next}.
4	Yet a fundamental question remains: \emph{which components of an execution trace actually matter?}
5	
6	\citet{wang2025dcsh} found that no single trace representation consistently outperforms others, but focused on generation-oriented tasks.
7	\emph{Verdict prediction}---classifying whether a test passes or fails---is fundamentally different: it is fault detection, not generation.
8	Which trace components matter for this task type is unknown.
9	
10	We present the first systematic study of what trace components drive verdict prediction.
11	Using 591 problems from HumanEval \citep{chen2021evaluating} and MBPP-sanitized \citep{austin2021program}, we decompose a multi-component trace representation (VOTA: exception events + assertion-point comparisons + loop compression) into individual components across Qwen-2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct and DeepSeek-Coder-6.7B-Instruct.
12	
13	\textbf{Exception events alone achieve near-perfect verdict prediction on Qwen (99.83\% $\pm$ 0.00, 3 seeds) and are the most effective component on DeepSeek (2/3 seeds at 99.33\%; 1 outlier at 91.09\%).}
14	VOTA degrades by 14.96pp on DeepSeek, confounded by tokenizer-driven truncation.
15	We decompose the full-trace-to-VOTA gap into gradient dilution (26\%) and information overload (74\%), showing that irrelevant trace content is the primary bottleneck.
16	The novelty: (1)~adding trace information actively \emph{hurts}, (2)~we decompose \emph{why} into a 26/74 split, and (3)~the cross-model gap is confounded by truncation (\S\ref{sec:cross_model}).
17	
18	Our contributions:
19	\begin{enumerate}
20	\item \textbf{Exception signal transfer}: Exception events alone achieve ${\geq}$99.33\% on both models, while VOTA degrades by 14.96pp on the weaker model (\S\ref{sec:cross_model}).
21	\item \textbf{Information density decomposition}: The full-trace-to-VOTA gap splits into gradient dilution (26\%) and information overload (74\%) (\S\ref{sec:density}).
22	\item \textbf{Two-tier diagnostic hierarchy}: Tier~1 signals (exceptions, assertions) achieve ${\geq}$99.8\%; Tier~2 (loops) reaches 85.6\% (\S\ref{sec:ablation}).
23	\end{enumerate}

```text
1	\section{Method}
2	
3	\subsection{Task Definition}
4	
5	We study \emph{verdict prediction}: given a Python function, a test input, and an optional execution trace, predict whether the test passes or fails.
6	The model produces a single token---\texttt{pass} or \texttt{fail}---making this a binary classification task.
7	Unlike code generation \citep{chen2025tracepile} or output prediction \citep{gu2024cruxeval}, verdict prediction isolates the model's ability to detect faults from its ability to simulate execution.
8	
9	\subsection{Dataset}
10	\label{sec:dataset}
11	
12	We sampled 10 candidate solutions per problem from Qwen-2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct (temperature 0.8, top\_p 0.95) for 591 problems from HumanEval \citep{chen2021evaluating} (164) and MBPP-sanitized \citep{austin2021program} (427), executed each against canonical tests with \texttt{sys.settrace} to obtain line-level traces and pass/fail verdicts, yielding 5,910 pairs (67\% pass, 33\% fail).
13	The dataset is split 80/20 by problem ID into 4,720 training and 1,190 test samples (majority baseline: 71.51\%).
14	The \texttt{exception\_only} format collapses passing solutions into identical rows (39.45\% train, 48.99\% test duplicates); train--test input overlap is zero (Appendix~\ref{sec:dedup_stats}).
15	
16	\subsection{Trace Representations}
17	
18	We define seven conditions that vary the trace information available (Figure~\ref{fig:trace_overview}):
19	\begin{itemize}
20	\item \texttt{no\_trace}: Source code and test input only.
21	\item \texttt{full\_trace}: Complete line-by-line trace with variable states.
22	\item \texttt{VOTA}: Exception events + assertion-point comparisons + loop compression.
23	\item \texttt{exception\_only}: Only exception/error events.
24	\item \texttt{ae\_only}: Only assertion-point actual/expected pairs.
25	\item \texttt{loop\_only}: Only loop compression summaries.
26	\item \texttt{VOTA\_no\_ae}: VOTA without assertion-point information.
27	\end{itemize}
28	
29	\begin{figure*}[t]
30	\centering
31	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{fig1_trace_overview}
32	\caption{Overview of the verdict prediction pipeline. Source code and a test input are executed to produce a full raw trace. Four conditions vary the trace information: \texttt{no\_trace} (75.13\%), \texttt{full\_trace} (81.76\%), VOTA (99.41\%), and \texttt{exception\_only} (99.83\%). Accuracies for Qwen-2.5-7B (seed=42, $N{=}1{,}190$).}
33	\label{fig:trace_overview}
34	\end{figure*}
35	
36	\subsection{Models and Training}
37	
38	We evaluate \textbf{Qwen-2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct} \citep{qwen2025coder} (5.5T pretrain tokens) and \textbf{DeepSeek-Coder-6.7B-Instruct} \citep{deepseek2024coder} (2T tokens), providing a natural axis for model-dependent trace utility \citep{dong2024composition}.
39	All conditions use LoRA \citep{hu2022lora} (rank=16, $\alpha$=32, dropout=0.05) on all linear layers, 3 epochs, effective batch size 32, LR $2 \times 10^{-4}$ with linear warmup/decay, max sequence length 2{,}048 tokens.
40	Sequences exceeding this limit are truncated while preserving the verdict label.
41	The primary seed is 42; seeds 123 and 456 test \texttt{exception\_only} robustness (Appendix~\ref{sec:training_details}).
42	
43	\subsection{Loss Ablation}
44	
45	To disentangle training signal from input signal quality, we introduce \texttt{full\_trace\_label\_only}: identical full-trace input but loss computed only on the verdict token (trace positions masked).
46	Improvement over standard \texttt{full\_trace} is attributable to \emph{gradient dilution}; the remaining gap to VOTA reflects \emph{information overload} at inference time.

1	\section{Experiments}
2	
3	We evaluate across two research questions:
4	(1)~Do Tier~1 exception signals generalize across models?
5	(2)~What is the relative contribution of each trace component?
6	All experiments use $N{=}1{,}190$ test samples; accuracy is reported with Wilson 95\% CIs.
7	Pairwise comparisons use paired bootstrap resampling ($B{=}10{,}000$, seed=42); all differences are significant at $p{<}0.0001$ unless noted.
8	
9	\subsection{Cross-Model Comparison}
10	\label{sec:cross_model}
11	
12	Table~\ref{tab:cross_model} compares Qwen-2.5-7B and DeepSeek-6.7B under four conditions.
13	
14	\begin{table}[t]
15	\centering
16	\caption{Cross-model accuracy ($N{=}1{,}190$). $^\dag$3-seed: 99.33\% (seeds 42, 456) and 91.09\% (seed 123, LoRA outlier). $^\S$Qwen only. Full CIs in Appendix~\ref{sec:full_results}.}
17	\label{tab:cross_model}
18	\small
19	\begin{tabular}{lccc}
20	\toprule
21	\textbf{Condition} & \textbf{Qwen-2.5-7B} & \textbf{DeepSeek-6.7B} & \textbf{Gap} \\
22	\midrule
23	exception\_only & \textbf{99.83}\% & 99.33\%$^\dag$ & 0.50pp \\
24	VOTA & 99.41\% & 84.45\% & 14.96pp \\
25	VOTA\_no\_ae & 99.41\%$^\S$ & --- & --- \\
26	full\_trace & 81.76\% & 79.16\% & 2.60pp \\
27	no\_trace & 75.13\% & 73.36\% & 1.77pp \\
28	\midrule
29	Majority baseline & 71.51\% & 71.51\% & --- \\
30	\bottomrule
31	\end{tabular}
32	\end{table}
33	
34	Under \texttt{exception\_only}, Qwen achieves 99.83\% $\pm$ 0.00 across three seeds, while DeepSeek shows bimodal behavior: seeds 42 and 456 achieve 99.33\%, seed 123 yields 91.09\% (LoRA initialization outlier; fail recall = 70.5\%).
35	Even the outlier outperforms VOTA (84.45\%) by 6.64pp, confirming exception events as the most effective component across models.
36	The 14.96pp VOTA gap is confounded by tokenizer-driven truncation: 91.7\% of DeepSeek VOTA training samples exceed the 2{,}048-token context window, truncating diagnostic content (Appendix~\ref{sec:tokenizer_analysis}).
37	In contrast, \texttt{exception\_only} inputs average ${\sim}$200 tokens, making the cross-model comparison clean.
38	The \texttt{no\_trace} baseline confirms that source code alone provides limited signal, only marginally above majority-class guessing.
39	
40	\subsection{Component Ablation}
41	\label{sec:ablation}
42	
43	Table~\ref{tab:ablation} decomposes VOTA on Qwen-2.5-7B (seed=42), revealing a two-tier hierarchy.
44	
45	\begin{table}[t]
46	\centering
47	\caption{Component ablation on Qwen-2.5-7B ($N{=}1{,}190$, seed=42). Tier~1 signals achieve near-perfect accuracy; combining them (VOTA) slightly dilutes performance.}
48	\label{tab:ablation}
49	\small
50	\resizebox{\columnwidth}{!}{%
51	\begin{tabular}{llccc}
52	\toprule
53	\textbf{Condition} & \textbf{Components} & \textbf{Acc (\%)} & \textbf{95\% CI} & \textbf{Tier} \\
54	\midrule
55	ae\_only & assertion-point & \textbf{99.92} & [99.75, 100.00] & 1 \\
56	exception\_only & exception events & 99.83 & [99.58, 100.00] & 1 \\
57	VOTA & exc+ae+loop & 99.41 & [98.82, 99.83] & --- \\
58	VOTA\_no\_ae & exc+loop & 99.41 & [98.90, 99.80] & --- \\
59	loop\_only & loop compression & 85.63 & [83.53, 87.56] & 2 \\
60	full\_trace & complete trace & 81.76 & [79.70, 83.90] & --- \\
61	no\_trace & none & 75.13 & [72.77, 77.48] & --- \\
62	\midrule
63	Regex (best) & exc.\ type regex & 93.61 & --- & --- \\
64	\bottomrule
65	\end{tabular}%
66	}
67	\end{table}
68	
69	Tier~1 signals are individually sufficient: \texttt{ae\_only} (99.92\%) and \texttt{exception\_only} (99.83\%) are statistically indistinguishable ($p{=}0.80$) and both exceed VOTA ($p{=}0.01$), implying that combining signals introduces noise.
70	Removing assertion points has no effect (\texttt{VOTA\_no\_ae} = 99.41\%), confirming exception dominance.
71	Tier~2 \texttt{loop\_only} (85.63\%) improves 10.50pp over \texttt{no\_trace} ($p{<}0.0001$) but falls far short of Tier~1.
72	The strongest regex baseline (93.61\%) trails SFT by 6.22pp (McNemar $p{<}0.001$); the model learns to distinguish caught from uncaught exceptions (Appendix~\ref{sec:regex_baselines}).
73	
74	\subsection{Information Density Decomposition}
75	\label{sec:density}
76	
77	The 17.65pp gap between \texttt{full\_trace} (81.76\%) and VOTA (99.41\%) decomposes via \texttt{full\_trace\_label\_only}, which retains the full trace but masks all trace tokens from the loss.
78	
79	\begin{table}[t]
80	\centering
81	\caption{Information density decomposition: gradient dilution (26\%) vs.\ information overload (74\%).}
82	\label{tab:density}
83	\small
84	\begin{tabular}{lccc}
85	\toprule
86	\textbf{Condition} & \textbf{Acc (\%)} & \textbf{$\Delta$ vs.\ full\_trace} & \textbf{Gap explained} \\
87	\midrule
88	full\_trace & 81.76 & --- & --- \\
89	label\_only & 86.22 & +4.46pp & 26\% \\
90	VOTA & 99.41 & +17.65pp & 100\% \\
91	\bottomrule
92	\end{tabular}
93	\end{table}
94	
95	Gradient dilution accounts for 26\% (+4.46pp, $p{<}0.0001$, bootstrap 95\% CI $[{+}2.35, {+}6.55]$) and information overload for 74\% (+13.19pp).
96	
97	\subsection{Additional Analyses}
98	\label{sec:additional}
99	
100	\paragraph{Trace length ablation.}
101	\label{sec:trace_length}
102	Varying the trace token budget (256--no limit) on Qwen yields accuracy in a narrow 77.2\%--81.8\% band with a non-monotonic pattern, confirming that trace content quality---not quantity---is the bottleneck (Appendix~\ref{sec:trace_length_full}).
103	
104	\paragraph{Calibration.}
105	\label{sec:calibration}
106	Calibration mirrors the tier hierarchy: \texttt{exception\_only} ECE = 0.0027 vs.\ \texttt{no\_trace} ECE = 0.171---a 63$\times$ gap (Appendix~\ref{sec:calibration_full}).
107	
108	\paragraph{Cross-dataset generalization.}
109	\label{sec:debugbench}
110	On DebugBench \citep{tian2024debugbench} ($N{=}426$), the ranking is preserved: \texttt{exception\_only} 100\%, VOTA 99.77\%, \texttt{no\_trace} 96.71\%; narrow margins reflect a ceiling effect from structurally distinctive mutations (Appendix~\ref{sec:debugbench_full}).

3	Verdict prediction is fundamentally fault detection: the model determines whether execution deviated from expected behavior.
4	Exception events are the most explicit deviation signal---self-contained diagnostic moments that explain why \texttt{exception\_only} matches or exceeds VOTA: non-exception components dilute the model's attention without providing complementary information.
5	
6	The Tier~1 accuracy (${\geq}$99.8\%) confirms that fault indicator presence detection is sufficient.
7	The contribution lies in quantifying the cost of richer representations: adding trace information actively \emph{hurts} (VOTA $<$ \texttt{exception\_only}, Table~\ref{tab:ablation}), compounded by tokenizer-driven truncation on DeepSeek (\S\ref{sec:cross_model}).
8	The 6.22pp SFT advantage over the best regex concentrates on caught-exception boundary cases, confirming the model learns semantic distinctions beyond mere presence detection (Appendix~\ref{sec:regex_baselines}).
9	Training dynamics reveal that DeepSeek seeds with near-identical losses differ by 8.24pp in accuracy (Appendix~\ref{sec:training_dynamics}), and the 0.50pp cross-model exception gap provides a clean capability measure unconfounded by truncation (Appendix~\ref{sec:robustness_analysis}).
10	Irreducible error analysis is in Appendix~\ref{sec:irreducible}.

3	\paragraph{Execution Traces for Code LLMs.}
4	TracePile \citep{chen2025tracepile} scaled trace-augmented training to 2.6M samples; \citet{wang2025dcsh} found trace utility to be task- and format-dependent---a finding we extend by identifying exception events as the dominant signal for verdict prediction.
5	NExT \citep{ni2024next} and ET-CoT \citep{eguchi2025etcot} leveraged trace chain-of-thought for repair and execution reasoning.
6	\citet{ferrando2025execute} found compact traces comparable to full traces, supporting our information density finding.
7	CRUXEval \citep{gu2024cruxeval} established execution reasoning benchmarks, extended to 19 languages by \citet{xu2025cruxevalx}.
8	None decompose which trace components contribute to \emph{classification} accuracy.
9	
10	\paragraph{Code Verdict and Patch Classification.}
11	TRACED \citep{ding2024traced} showed execution-aware pretraining improves vulnerability and clone detection.
12	In patch correctness, APPT \citep{appt2024} achieved 79.7\% with BERT+LSTM; LLM4PatchCorrect \citep{zhou2024llm4patch} reached 84.4\% using execution traces.
13	FuseFL \citep{widyasari2024fusefl} demonstrated that structured fault signals improve fault localization.
14	\citet{foster2025mutation} deployed LLM-based equivalence detection at Meta with 0.95 precision.
15	These approaches treat traces as monolithic inputs; none isolate individual components or test cross-model generalization.
16	
17	\paragraph{Trace Compression and Selection.}
18	TraceCoder \citep{huang2026tracecoder} and InspectCoder \citep{wang2025inspectcoder} use selective trace extraction for debugging; \citet{haque2025traces} found raw traces provide limited repair benefit, supporting our compression finding.
19	Our information density decomposition---gradient dilution (26\%) vs.\ information overload (74\%)---provides the first quantitative framework for \emph{why} compression helps, complementing these methods' focus on \emph{how} to compress.

1	\section{Conclusion}
2	
3	We presented the first systematic component ablation of trace representations for verdict prediction.
4	Exception events alone achieve 99.83\% on Qwen ($\pm$ 0.00, 3 seeds) and 99.33\% on 2/3 DeepSeek seeds, transferring across model families with a 0.50pp gap---while VOTA degrades by 14.96pp on DeepSeek due to tokenizer-driven context overflow.
5	The full-trace-to-VOTA gap decomposes into gradient dilution (26\%) and information overload (74\%), with a trace length ablation confirming that content quality---not quantity---is the bottleneck.
6	Component ablation reveals Tier~1 signals (exceptions, assertion points) at ${\geq}$99.8\% and Tier~2 (loop compression) at 85.6\%; combining tiers slightly degrades performance.
7	A cross-dataset evaluation on DebugBench confirms exception dominance generalizes (\texttt{exception\_only}: 100\%, $N{=}426$).
8	
9	The practical principle: for verdict prediction, extract the highest-specificity diagnostic signal and discard everything else.
10	Future work should test whether this extends to additional datasets, model scales, and tasks beyond verdict prediction.

102	\section{VOTA Trace Examples}
103	\label{sec:vota_examples}
104	
105	We provide two representative VOTA trace examples illustrating the fail and pass cases.
106	In the fail case, the exception event provides an unambiguous fault signal.
107	In the pass case, the absence of an exception event combined with a matching assertion point confirms correct execution.
108	
109	\paragraph{Fail example.}
110	A \texttt{ZeroDivisionError} triggers an \texttt{[ERROR]} event, providing a direct fault signal that is sufficient for the model to predict \texttt{fail}.
111	
112	\begin{small}
113	\begin{verbatim}
114	## Function
115	def divide(a, b):
116	    return a / b
117	
118	## Test Input
119	divide(1, 0)
120	
121	## Expected Output
122	inf
123	
124	## VOTA Trace
125	[ERROR] ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
126	
127	## Verdict
128	fail
129	\end{verbatim}
130	\end{small}
131	
132	\paragraph{Pass example.}
133	No exception is raised, and the assertion point confirms that the actual output matches the expected value.
134	
135	\begin{small}
136	\begin{verbatim}
137	## Function
138	def add(a, b):
139	    return a + b
140	
141	## Test Input
142	add(2, 3)
143	
144	## Expected Output
145	5
146	
147	## VOTA Trace
148	[LOOP] No loops detected.
149	[ASSERT] actual=5, expected=5
150	
151	## Verdict
152	pass
153	\end{verbatim}
154	\end{small}
155	
156	These examples illustrate the core asymmetry exploited by the \texttt{exception\_only} condition: fail cases produce an explicit \texttt{[ERROR]} event, while pass cases are characterized by its absence.
157	This binary signal---presence vs.\ absence of an exception---is sufficient for near-perfect verdict prediction.

211	\section{Tokenizer and Truncation Analysis}
212	\label{sec:tokenizer_analysis}
213	
214	The VOTA cross-model gap (14.96pp, Table~\ref{tab:cross_model}) is confounded by a training-time truncation asymmetry.
215	The DeepSeek tokenizer averages 2{,}626 tokens per VOTA sample versus 1{,}929 for Qwen, causing 91.7\% of DeepSeek VOTA training samples to exceed the 2{,}048-token context window.
216	The training framework preserves the verdict label but truncates trace content, so the model trains with incomplete diagnostic information for the majority of samples.
217	
218	A post-hoc group analysis provides directional evidence: partitioning DeepSeek VOTA test samples by whether their training-set counterparts exceeded the context window, intact samples ($N{=}99$) achieve 100\% accuracy while truncated samples ($N{=}1{,}091$) achieve 83.04\% (95\% CI [80.75\%, 85.24\%]; Fisher exact $p{<}0.001$), with all 185 errors concentrated in the fail class (fail recall = 31.23\%).
219	Per-class analysis (Table~\ref{tab:per_class}) confirms that DeepSeek VOTA achieves 100\% fail precision but only 45.43\% fail recall, systematically defaulting to \texttt{pass}---in contrast to Qwen VOTA, which achieves 100\% fail recall.
220	
221	Seed robustness diverges across models: Qwen \texttt{exception\_only} produces identical 99.83\% across all three seeds ($\sigma{=}0$), while DeepSeek shows bimodal behavior: seeds 42 and 456 achieve 99.33\% (fail recall = 100\%), seed 123 yields 91.09\% (fail recall = 70.5\%).
222	Because \texttt{exception\_only} test inputs contain 48.99\% duplicates (607 unique of 1,190; \S\ref{sec:dataset}), CIs assume $n{=}1{,}190$ independent trials; under deduplication ($n{=}607$), Qwen's accuracy is 99.67\% (Wilson CI [98.81, 99.91]).
223	
224	%% ============================================================
225	\section{Irreducible Sample Analysis}
226	\label{sec:irreducible}
227	
228	The \texttt{exception\_only} condition with Qwen-2.5-Coder-7B misclassifies exactly 2 out of 1,190 test samples across all three seeds (42, 123, 456), with 100\% overlap across seeds.
229	Both samples (IDs 901 and 905) share the following characteristics:
230	
231	\begin{itemize}
232	\item \textbf{Function:} \texttt{check\_dict\_case} (HumanEval/95)---a function that checks whether all dictionary keys are uniformly upper-case or lower-case strings.
233	\item \textbf{Ground-truth label:} \texttt{pass}.
234	\item \textbf{Predicted label:} \texttt{fail} (false negative).
235	\item \textbf{Cross-seed consistency:} Both samples are misclassified identically by all three seeds, indicating a systematic rather than stochastic error.
236	\end{itemize}
237	
238	Manual inspection reveals the root cause: \texttt{check\_dict\_case} uses \texttt{all()} over a generator expression, and Python's \texttt{all()} short-circuits on the first \texttt{True} value, raising \texttt{GeneratorExit} to terminate the generator.
239	Because \texttt{GeneratorExit} is a \texttt{BaseException} subclass, the tracer records it as seven \texttt{[ERROR] GeneratorExit} lines---even though the function executes correctly and the test passes.
240	The model observes these spurious error markers and reasonably but incorrectly predicts \texttt{fail}.
241	This is not a model failure but a representation ceiling: the \texttt{exception\_only} format cannot distinguish genuine exceptions from benign \texttt{BaseException} subclasses triggered by Python's iterator protocol.
242	
243	These 2 irreducible errors establish a practical accuracy ceiling of $1 - 2/1190 = 99.83\%$ for the \texttt{exception\_only} condition on this dataset, suggesting that further improvements would require either supplementary trace signals or modifications to the input representation.

246	\section{Trace Length Ablation}
247	\label{sec:trace_length_full}
248	
249	To test whether the \texttt{full\_trace} performance gap is caused by input truncation at training time, we vary the maximum trace token budget on Qwen-2.5-7B (seed=42) while keeping all other hyperparameters fixed.

307	}
308	\end{table}
309	
310	\paragraph{Non-monotonic pattern.}
311	The trend across trace budgets is non-monotonic: 512 tokens (80.42\%) slightly outperforms 256 tokens (78.82\%), but doubling to 1024 tokens \emph{decreases} accuracy to 77.23\%---a statistically significant 3.19pp drop ($p{=}0.002$, 95\% CI [$-$5.29, $-$1.09]).
312	The no-limit condition (81.76\%) recovers and significantly exceeds 1024 tokens ($p{<}0.001$), but 1024 tokens is not significantly better than the \texttt{no\_trace} baseline (75.13\%; $\Delta{=}{+}2.10$pp, $p{=}0.078$, 95\% CI [$-$0.17, $+$4.37]).
313	This means that truncating traces to an intermediate length can be \emph{worse} than providing no trace at all---the 1024-token budget retains enough irrelevant content to mislead the model while discarding diagnostic events that might appear late in the trace.
314	
315	\paragraph{Comparison to baselines.}
316	All four trace budget conditions significantly exceed \texttt{no\_trace} except 1024 tokens ($p{=}0.078$), confirming that raw trace content provides some signal but unreliably so.
317	The gap to \texttt{exception\_only} (99.83\%) is massive for every budget condition (18--23pp, all $p{<}0.001$), underscoring that even unlimited raw traces cannot substitute for targeted signal extraction.
318	The best full-trace condition (no\_limit, 81.76\%) still lags \texttt{exception\_only} by 18.07pp (95\% CI [$-$20.34, $-$15.88]).
319	
320	\paragraph{Interpretation.}
321	These results rule out input truncation as the primary explanation for the full-trace performance gap: even with unlimited tokens, the model cannot extract the diagnostic signal that VOTA's targeted compression provides.
322	The non-monotonic dip at 1024 tokens is consistent with a ``worst-of-both-worlds'' regime where the model receives enough noisy context to dilute the signal but not enough to compensate through broader coverage.
323	The result reinforces the information density interpretation (\S\ref{sec:density}): the gap between full traces and VOTA is driven by the \emph{content} of the trace (irrelevant lines diluting the diagnostic signal), not its \emph{length}.
324	In contrast, VOTA's compressed representation concentrates the diagnostic signal into fewer tokens, making it sensitive to truncation when those tokens are removed (\S\ref{sec:cross_model}).

327	\section{Calibration Analysis}
328	\label{sec:calibration_full}
329	
330	Beyond accuracy, we evaluate whether trace conditions affect prediction calibration, motivated by recent findings that code LLM confidence is often poorly calibrated \citep{spiess2025calibration}.

333	\centering

348	\end{table}
349	
350	Table~\ref{tab:calibration} shows that calibration quality mirrors the Tier~1/2 hierarchy.
351	Tier~1 conditions (\texttt{ae\_only}: ECE=0.0004; \texttt{exception\_only}: ECE=0.0027) produce near-perfectly calibrated predictions, while \texttt{full\_trace} (ECE=0.096) and \texttt{no\_trace} (ECE=0.171) exhibit substantial miscalibration.
352	VOTA (ECE=0.0054) is well-calibrated but slightly worse than either Tier~1 component alone, reinforcing the pattern that combining trace signals dilutes rather than improves the prediction signal.
353	
354	The Brier scores tell a consistent story: \texttt{ae\_only} (0.0008) and \texttt{exception\_only} (0.0013) achieve near-zero scores, while \texttt{no\_trace} (0.197) indicates substantial miscalibration.

364	\section{Cross-Dataset Generalization: DebugBench}
365	\label{sec:debugbench_full}
366	
367	To test whether exception-based verdict prediction generalizes beyond LLM-generated solutions, we evaluate on DebugBench \citep{tian2024debugbench}---a dataset of human-written programs with synthetically injected bugs (single-point mutations such as operator replacement, variable misuse, and missing statements).
368	After filtering for executable Python samples with valid traces, we retain 426 samples with a near-balanced class distribution (majority baseline: 51.4\%).
369	
370	\begin{table}[t]

372	\caption{Generalization to DebugBench ($N{=}426$, Qwen-2.5-7B, seed=42). Wilson 95\% CIs. The component ranking (exception\_only $\geq$ VOTA $>$ no\_trace) is preserved, and exception\_only achieves perfect accuracy.}
373	\label{tab:debugbench}

383	Majority baseline & 51.41 & --- \\
384	\bottomrule
385	\end{tabular}
386	\end{table}
387	
388	Table~\ref{tab:debugbench} shows that the component ranking from the main experiments is preserved: \texttt{exception\_only} (100.00\%) $\geq$ VOTA (99.77\%) $>$ \texttt{no\_trace} (96.71\%).
389	The \texttt{exception\_only} condition achieves perfect accuracy, confirming that the exception-based representation generalizes to a different fault distribution without degradation.
390	
391	The absolute margins are much narrower than on the main dataset: the \texttt{no\_trace} baseline already achieves 96.71\%---compared to 75.13\% on HumanEval+MBPP---leaving only 3.29pp of headroom for trace-based improvement.
392	This ceiling effect reflects a fundamental difference in fault characteristics: DebugBench bugs are synthetically injected single-point mutations, which produce code that is structurally dissimilar from the original correct solution; a model can often identify the fault from source code alone.
393	In contrast, the HumanEval+MBPP solutions are LLM-generated, producing natural errors (logic mistakes, edge-case failures) where the faulty and correct solutions may be structurally similar, making code-only verdict prediction substantially harder.
394	
395	These results support exception-based verdict prediction as a generalizable approach---the method does not degrade on an out-of-distribution dataset, and the exception dominance ranking (exception\_only $\geq$ VOTA $>$ no\_trace) is consistent across both datasets---but the narrow DebugBench margins are insufficient to independently validate trace importance.
396	The 24.70pp trace lift on the main dataset (no\_trace 75.13\% $\to$ exception\_only 99.83\%) remains the primary evidence for the value of exception-based trace signals.
397	
398	%% ============================================================
399	\section{Cross-Model Robustness Analysis}
400	\label{sec:robustness_analysis}
401	
402	The cross-model gap pattern (Table~\ref{tab:cross_model}) suggests a design principle: \emph{trace representations should match the model capability floor, not the ceiling.}
403	Exception events are consistently the most effective component on both models, and their structural simplicity---a fixed-format error message---ensures that the relative advantage over richer representations holds across all seeds.
404	Two of three DeepSeek seeds match Qwen-level accuracy (99.33\%); the outlier (seed 123, 91.09\%) is attributable to LoRA initialization landing in a suboptimal basin (fail recall = 70.5\%), not to a failure of the exception signal itself---even this outlier outperforms VOTA (84.45\%) by 6.64pp.
405	The VOTA cross-model gap is confounded by two factors: (1)~tokenizer efficiency---the DeepSeek tokenizer averages 2{,}626 tokens per VOTA sample versus Qwen's 1{,}929, causing 91.7\% of training samples to exceed the 2{,}048-token context window; content-aware truncation preferentially removes the terminal structured prompt, preserving the verdict label but truncating trace content---and (2)~base model capability differences, consistent with findings that SFT generalization depends on pretrain quality \citep{yang2024generalization}.
406	The two factors cannot be disentangled in the current experimental design.
407	Our \texttt{exception\_only} design sidesteps the truncation confound entirely: inputs average ${\sim}$200 tokens, well below the 2{,}048-token limit, so no training samples are truncated on either model.
408	The resulting 0.50pp cross-model gap (Table~\ref{tab:cross_model}) is therefore a clean measure of model capability differences, making the ``capability floor'' principle directly testable.
409	The practical implication is that trace-based systems should default to the simplest sufficient signal; for smaller models, training stability (multi-seed selection, warmup schedules) is a secondary but addressable concern.
410	
411	%% ============================================================
412	\section{Training Dynamics and Loss Decoupling}
413	\label{sec:training_dynamics}
414	
415	The DeepSeek \texttt{exception\_only} results reveal two instructive training dynamics.
416	First, epoch-level analysis shows mild degradation in 2/3 seeds: seed 42 peaks at 99.83\% after epoch~1 but settles at 99.33\% by epoch~3 ($-$0.50pp), seed 123 degrades from 91.43\% to 91.09\% ($-$0.34pp), while seed 456 shows no epoch degradation (99.33\% at both epoch~1 and epoch~3).
417	Early stopping may yield marginal gains for some seeds, but the epoch effect is small (${\leq}$0.5pp) compared to the seed effect (8.24pp between seeds 42 and 123).
418	
419	Second, seeds 123 and 456 converge to nearly identical final training losses (0.122 and 0.123 respectively), yet their accuracies differ by 8.24pp (91.09\% vs.\ 99.33\%).
420	The critical difference lies in fail recall: seeds 42 and 456 achieve 100\%, while seed 123 achieves only 70.5\%---the LoRA initialization in seed 123 fails to learn the exception$\to$fail mapping for a substantial fraction of failing samples, even though the per-token loss appears converged.
421	This demonstrates that token-level training loss can mask fundamental differences in sample-level classification ability, suggesting a parallel to the eval-loss/accuracy decoupling observed in DeepSeek VOTA (where eval loss rose 65\% from epoch 1 to 3 while accuracy improved by 6.3pp) at the training phase.
422	The practical recommendation is twofold: (1)~use task-specific metrics (accuracy, fail recall) for checkpoint and seed selection rather than training or evaluation loss, and (2)~for deployment on smaller models, train multiple seeds and select the best, as a single run may not reliably converge to the correct classification boundary.
423	
424	The contrast with VOTA is instructive: DeepSeek VOTA accuracy monotonically increases from 78.15\% to 84.45\% across epochs, but is consistent with a performance limit associated with the high trace truncation rate (\S\ref{sec:cross_model})---the model progressively extracts signal from samples with intact trace content but cannot fully compensate for the information loss in the truncated majority.
425	The 84.45\% accuracy reflects a combination of trace information loss and model capability constraints.
426	
427	%% ============================================================
428	\section{Deduplication Statistics}
429	\label{sec:dedup_stats}
430	
431	Table~\ref{tab:dedup} reports the duplication rates across trace formats.
432	Because multiple passing solutions to the same problem produce identical (input, output) pairs in the \texttt{exception\_only} format---correct executions raise no exceptions, so the trace content is the same regardless of the solution's internal logic---the dataset contains duplicate rows.
433	Train--test input overlap is zero (split by problem ID), so no information leakage occurs.
434	The high duplication in \texttt{exception\_only} does not affect our experimental conclusions: after deduplication the training set still contains 2,858 unique samples and the test set 607, providing sufficient coverage for the 591-problem benchmark.
435	The \texttt{exception\_only} test set contains 48.99\% duplicate inputs due to representation compactness; all confidence intervals treat samples as independent Bernoulli trials.
436	
437	\begin{table}[t]
438	\centering

454	\section{Regex Baseline Analysis}
455	\label{sec:regex_baselines}
456	
457	To establish a non-learning upper bound, we evaluate five regex-based baselines on the \texttt{exception\_only} test set ($N{=}1{,}190$) and two format-specific baselines on VOTA and \texttt{full\_trace} inputs.
458	
459	\begin{table}[t]
460	\centering
461	\caption{Regex baseline accuracy ($N{=}1{,}190$). B4 is the strongest legitimate baseline (6.22pp below SFT \texttt{exception\_only}, McNemar $p{<}0.001$). $^\ddag$B5 exploits a data formatting artifact: the \texttt{[No exception data in trace]} marker is deterministically present in all pass samples, making this a format-level shortcut rather than a genuine exception-based heuristic.}
462	\label{tab:regex}
463	\small
464	\begin{tabular}{llc}
465	\toprule
466	\textbf{Baseline} & \textbf{Method} & \textbf{Acc (\%)} \\
467	\midrule
468	B1: \texttt{[ERROR]} presence & string match & 93.45 \\
469	B2: Traceback presence & string match & 71.51 \\
470	B3: Any keyword & union of B1+B2+Exception & 93.45 \\
471	B4: Exception type regex & regex on exception class names & \textbf{93.61} \\
472	B5: Format marker & \texttt{[No exception data]} $\to$ pass & 99.33$^\ddag$ \\
473	\midrule
474	VOTA format regex & best regex on VOTA traces & 75.55 \\
475	full\_trace format regex & best regex on full traces & 77.39 \\
476	\bottomrule
477	\end{tabular}
478	\end{table}
479	
480	The strongest legitimate baseline (B4, 93.61\%) applies regex pattern-matching on Python exception class names (e.g., \texttt{ValueError}, \texttt{TypeError}).
481	Its errors concentrate on 8 boundary samples where a \texttt{ValueError} is raised inside a \texttt{try/except} block and caught---the program passes despite an exception occurring in the trace.
482	SFT \texttt{exception\_only} correctly classifies 6 of these 8 samples, indicating that the model learns the semantic distinction between caught (benign) and uncaught (fault-indicating) exceptions.
483	B5 (99.33\%) achieves near-SFT accuracy but relies on the deterministic presence of a format marker in pass-class traces, which is an artifact of the trace preprocessing pipeline rather than a generalizable signal; McNemar test vs.\ SFT yields $p{=}0.041$, confirming a statistically significant difference.

a model can often identify the fault from source code alone.\nIn contrast, the HumanEval+MBPP solutions are LLM-generated, producing natural errors (logic mistakes, edge-case failures) where the faulty and correct solutions may be structurally similar, making code-only verdict prediction substantially harder.\n\nThese results support exception-based verdict prediction as a generalizable approach---the method does not degrade on an out-of-distribution dataset, and the exception dominance ranking (exception\\_only $\\geq$ VOTA $>$ no\\_trace) is consistent across both datasets---but the narrow DebugBench margins are insufficient to independently validate trace importance.\nThe 24.70pp trace lift on the main dataset (no\\_trace 75.13\\% $\\to$ exception\\_only 99.83\\%) remains the primary evidence for the value of exception-based trace signals.\n\n%% ============================================================\n\\section{Cross-Model Robustness Analysis}\n\\label{sec:robustness_analysis}\n\nThe cross-model gap pattern (Table~\\ref{tab:cross_model}) suggests a design principle: \\emph{trace representations should match the model capability floor, not the ceiling.}\nException events are consistently the most effective component on both models, and their structural simplicity---a fixed-format error message---ensures that the relative advantage over richer representations holds across all seeds.\nTwo of three DeepSeek seeds match Qwen-level accuracy (99.33\\%); the outlier (seed 123, 91.09\\%) is attributable to LoRA initialization landing in a suboptimal basin (fail recall = 70.5\\%), not to a failure of the exception signal itself---even this outlier outperforms VOTA (84.45\\%) by 6.64pp.\nThe VOTA cross-model gap is confounded by two factors: (1)~tokenizer efficiency---the DeepSeek tokenizer averages 2{,}626 tokens per VOTA sample versus Qwen's 1{,}929, causing 91.7\\% of training samples to exceed the 2{,}048-token context window; content-aware truncation preferentially removes the terminal structured prompt, preserving the verdict label but truncating trace content---and (2)~base model capability differences, consistent with findings that SFT generalization depends on pretrain quality \\citep{yang2024generalization}.\nThe two factors cannot be disentangled in the current experimental design.\nOur \\texttt{exception\\_only} design sidesteps the truncation confound entirely: inputs average ${\\sim}$200 tokens, well below the 2{,}048-token limit, so no training samples are truncated on either model.\nThe resulting 0.50pp cross-model gap (Table~\\ref{tab:cross_model}) is therefore a clean measure of model capability differences, making the ``capability floor'' principle directly testable.\nThe practical implication is that trace-based systems should default to the simplest sufficient signal; for smaller models, training stability (multi-seed selection, warmup schedules) is a secondary but addressable concern.\n\n%% ============================================================\n\\section{Training Dynamics and Loss Decoupling}\n\\label{sec:training_dynamics}\n\nThe DeepSeek \\texttt{exception\\_only} results reveal two instructive training dynamics.\nFirst, epoch-level analysis shows mild degradation in 2/3 seeds: seed 42 peaks at 99.83\\% after epoch~1 but settles at 99.33\\% by epoch~3 ($-$0.50pp), seed 123 degrades from 91.43\\% to 91.09\\% ($-$0.34pp), while seed 456 shows no epoch degradation (99.33\\% at both epoch~1 and epoch~3).\nEarly stopping may yield marginal gains for some seeds, but the epoch effect is small (${\\leq}$0.5pp) compared to the seed effect (8.24pp between seeds 42 and 123).\n\nSecond, seeds 123 and 456 converge to nearly identical final training losses (0.122 and 0.123 respectively), yet their accuracies differ by 8.24pp (91.09\\% vs.\\ 99.33\\%).\nThe critical difference lies in fail recall: seeds 42 and 456 achieve 100\\%, while seed 123 achieves only 70.5\\%---the LoRA initialization in seed 123 fails to learn the exception$\\to$fail mapping for a substantial fraction of failing samples, even though the per-token loss appears converged.\nThis demonstrates that token-level training loss can mask fundamental differences in sample-level classification ability, suggesting a parallel to the eval-loss/accuracy decoupling observed in DeepSeek VOTA (where eval loss rose 65\\% from epoch 1 to 3 while accuracy improved by 6.3pp) at the training phase.\nThe practical recommendation is twofold: (1)~use task-specific metrics (accuracy, fail recall) for checkpoint and seed selection rather than training or evaluation loss, and (2)~for deployment on smaller models, train multiple seeds and select the best, as a single run may not reliably converge to the correct classification boundary.\n\nThe contrast with VOTA is instructive: DeepSeek VOTA accuracy monotonically increases from 78.15\\% to 84.45\\% across epochs, but is consistent with a performance limit associated with the high trace truncation rate (\\S\\ref{sec:cross_model})---the model progressively extracts signal from samples with intact trace content but cannot fully compensate for the information loss in the truncated majority.\nThe 84.45\\% accuracy reflects a combination of trace information loss and model capability constraints.\n\n%% ============================================================\n\\section{Deduplication Statistics}\n\\label{sec:dedup_stats}\n\nTable~\\ref{tab:dedup} reports the duplication rates across trace formats.\nBecause multiple passing solutions to the same problem produce identical (input, output) pairs in the \\texttt{exception\\_only} format---correct executions raise no exceptions, so the trace content is the same regardless of the solution's internal logic---the dataset contains duplicate rows.\nTrain--test input overlap is zero (split by problem ID), so no information leakage occurs.\nThe high duplication in \\texttt{exception\\_only} does not affect our experimental conclusions: after deduplication the training set still contains 2,858 unique samples and the test set 607, providing sufficient coverage for the 591-problem benchmark.\nThe \\texttt{exception\\_only} test set contains 48.99\\% duplicate inputs due to representation compactness; all confidence intervals treat samples as independent Bernoulli trials.\n\n\\begin{table}[t]\n\\centering\n\\caption{Deduplication statistics.

Let me now count the lines for each section:

- main.tex: 58 lines (includes abstract, limitations, ethics)
- introduction.tex: 23 lines
- method.tex: 47 lines
- experiments.tex: 111 lines
- discussion.tex: 10 lines
- related_work.tex: 19 lines
- conclusion.tex: 10 lines
- appendix.tex: 484 lines

The paper structure in main.tex shows:
- Abstract is in main.tex (lines 18-25)


- Limitations is in main.tex (lines 34-44)
- Ethics is in main.tex (lines 46-51)

Before I start editing, I should compile the paper to see the current page count. Let me check if pdflatex is available on the local machine in the docs/paper/ directory. Looking at the content more carefully, the introduction and method sections are already quite concise, while the experiments section at 111 lines is the most substantial part I'll need to work with.

Let me compile first to get the actual page count, and I should also check if there's a figures directory.
