## Core Claims (3 条)

### Claim 1 (Positive — Quality Estimation)
Structural consistency signals (entity voting confidence, soft Jaccard) are the strongest unsupervised quality estimators for entity-level IE, significantly outperforming model confidence (log-probability) and surface agreement (FK, exact-match) at instance-level quality prediction. Entity voting achieves AUROC 0.73 / ρ=0.50 on NER, SJ achieves AUROC 0.67 / ρ=0.36 — both far above logprob (AUROC 0.56 / ρ=0.14). Voting leads SJ on full set; SJ retains unique strength in conditional evaluation (ρ=0.41) and is temperature-robust (Δρ=±0.01).

**Key insight**: The contribution is about a FAMILY of structural consistency signals for QUALITY ESTIMATION (predicting which instances are reliable), not for per-sample selection. SJ and voting_conf both capture entity-across-sample consistency. SJ generalizes to arbitrary structured outputs; voting is simpler.

**Evidence** (SciERC, N=8, T=1.0, unified exp_015 evaluation):
- NER full (n=529): voting ρ=0.502/τ=0.377/AUROC=0.728, SJ ρ=0.357/τ=0.266/AUROC=0.666, FK ρ=0.265/τ=0.203/AUROC=0.624, EM ρ=0.257/τ=0.192/AUROC=0.623, logprob ρ=0.140/τ=0.101/AUROC=0.559
- NER cond (n=501): voting ρ=0.450, SJ ρ=0.412, EM ρ=0.343, FK ρ=0.306, logprob ρ=0.163
- RE full (n=397): voting ρ=0.422/AUROC=0.716, FK ρ=0.253/AUROC=0.631, logprob ρ=0.247/AUROC=0.635, SJ ρ=0.211/AUROC=0.582, EM ρ=0.100/AUROC=0.504
- RE cond (n=296): voting ρ=0.463, SJ ρ=0.368, EM ρ=0.361, FK ρ=0.317, logprob ρ=0.146
- Temperature robustness: SJ Δρ=±0.01 across T=0.7/1.0; FK Δρ=±0.06-0.09 (SJ far more stable)

### Claim 2 (Novel Finding — Correlation-Selection Gap)
Instance-level quality estimation ≠ per-sample selection ability. Despite strong instance-level correlation (ρ≈0.39-0.43), NO unsupervised confidence signal beats greedy decoding for NER best-of-N selection. On RE, only log-probability (+2.4pp over greedy) enables effective selection. The oracle headroom is large (NER +16pp, RE +18pp) but current signals cannot exploit it.

**exp-016 evidence** (SciERC, N=8, T=1.0, n=529):
- NER best-of-N: greedy 0.6094 > logprob 0.6087 > ensemble 0.6043 > sj 0.6042 > voting 0.5959 > random 0.5796 (oracle 0.7692)
- RE best-of-N: logprob 0.3971 > greedy 0.3735 > sj 0.3680 > voting 0.3379 ≈ random 0.3380 (oracle 0.5610)
- Instance-level AUROC: voting_conf 0.700, SJ 0.689, ensemble 0.735 >> logprob 0.591

**Key insight**: Consistency signals are INSTANCE-LEVEL aggregates (one score per instance). They predict which inputs are easy/hard, NOT which sample is best. Log-prob is the only PER-SAMPLE signal and uniquely enables selection on uncertain tasks (RE). This distinction between quality estimation and sample selection is the paper's most practically important finding.

**Implications**: (a) For selective prediction / abstention → use structural consistency (AUROC 0.70+). (b) For best-of-N selection → use logprob, but only on tasks where greedy is suboptimal (RE). (c) For NER, greedy is near-optimal → TTS offers no advantage with current signals.

### Claim 3 (Diagnostic — task-complexity boundary)
The effectiveness of consistency-based confidence is governed by task structural complexity: compound error propagation in relational tasks degrades the consistency-accuracy correlation on the full instance set, but the signal remains valid within the model's capability range. This boundary applies across all confidence signals tested.

**MVP evidence**: RE full rho_sj=0.234, RE cond rho_sj=0.372 (SJ>FK +11.8pp). Component decomposition shows all RE components equally weak (head_sj rho=0.210). T=0.7 naturally separates knowledge-gap vs uncertainty errors.

**exp-005 evidence**: Conditional filtering dwarfs temperature tuning — RE SJ cond lift +0.07~0.14 vs temperature effect ±0.01. T=1.0 preserves more oracle headroom (RE: 0.167 vs 0.131) and diversity (1-SJ: 0.389 vs 0.313). Recommendation: T=1.0 + conditional filtering, not temperature optimization.

**exp-001 N-scaling evidence** (SciERC, n=200 subset, ⚠️ needs full-set confirmation):
- RE N=16: voting_conf ρ=0.448 (vs N=8 0.340, +0.108), SJ ρ=0.333 (vs 0.244, +0.089), all signals improve +0.07~0.10
- NER N=16: flat (already saturated at N=8) — voting_conf 0.401 vs 0.392
- **Key insight**: The task-complexity boundary is partially a SAMPLE BUDGET boundary. Compound error propagation increases per-instance variance, requiring more samples (N=16 vs N=8) to average out noise. This makes Claim 2 more nuanced: RE consistency fails at N=8 not because the signal is absent, but because it's noisier and needs more samples to manifest.
- ⚠️ Caveat: exp-001 ran on 200/529 instances. Full-set replication needed before claiming in paper.

## Story Spine

**Problem**: LLM-based structured prediction (IE) increasingly uses multi-sample generation, but practitioners lack guidance on which confidence signals to trust — and for what purpose. Crucially, it is unknown whether signals that predict output quality (instance-level) also enable effective sample selection (per-sample-level).

**Existing approaches & gaps**: Self-consistency in reasoning uses exact-match voting (Wang et al. 2023). USC (Chen et al. 2024) uses LLM-as-judge. For structured prediction, no systematic comparison exists across confidence signal families. More importantly, prior work conflates quality estimation with selection — assuming that high correlation with accuracy translates to effective best-of-N selection.

**Our framing**: We systematically compare five confidence signals across four families for IE: (1) model confidence (log-probability), (2) surface agreement (FK, exact-match), (3) set-aware structural similarity (SJ), (4) entity-level majority voting. We make three findings:
1. Structural consistency (voting_conf/SJ) provides the strongest quality estimation (AUROC 0.73 vs logprob 0.56)
2. However, a **correlation-selection gap** exists: despite strong instance-level correlation, NO signal beats greedy decoding for NER selection; only logprob helps for RE (+2.4pp)
3. All signals degrade on relational tasks due to compound error propagation

**Headline result template**: "On NER, entity voting confidence achieves AUROC 0.73 and ρ=0.50 for quality estimation, significantly outperforming log-probability (AUROC 0.56, ρ=0.14). However, this quality estimation capability does NOT translate to effective best-of-N selection — no signal surpasses greedy decoding on NER (oracle headroom: +16pp). We identify a fundamental correlation-selection gap: instance-level consistency predicts WHICH INPUTS are reliable, not WHICH OUTPUTS are best. On RE, only per-sample log-probability enables selection (+2.4pp), while all consistency signals degrade."

## Anticipated Reviewer Concerns

### R1: "Only one NER dataset — generalization unclear"
- **Mitigation**: 2 datasets (SciERC + CoNLL-2003) × 2 models (Qwen3 + LLaMA) = 4 NER configurations. exp_017_llama_conll_infer SJ ρ=0.431 matches Qwen CoNLL ρ=0.436, demonstrating cross-model × cross-dataset consistency. Limitation: informal text domains (social media etc.) not covered — acknowledge in Limitations section.
- **Priority**: P0

### R2: "Only one model family (Qwen3-8B)"
- **Mitigation**: exp-007 (LLaMA-3.1-8B) shows model-agnostic effect
- **Priority**: P0

### R3: "FK is a strawman baseline — what about log-prob, USC, exact-match?"
- **Mitigation**: exp-012 (log-prob), exp-013 (exact-match), exp-014 (entity voting) provide comprehensive baseline comparison. Results: structural consistency family (SJ+voting) >> log-prob >> FK ≈ exact-match. USC discussed in related work (LLM-as-judge, orthogonal approach).
- **Priority**: P0, RESOLVED — results decisive

### R3b: "Voting confidence beats SJ — why use SJ?"
- **Mitigation**: SJ generalizes to arbitrary structured outputs (relations, events, any set-structured prediction). Voting is entity-specific. NER full: voting leads (ρ=0.50 vs 0.36), but SJ retains unique strength in conditional evaluation (ρ=0.41 vs voting 0.45) and is more temperature-robust (Δρ=±0.01). RE cond: SJ ρ=0.37 competitive with voting 0.46. SJ is also more interpretable (pairwise similarity). Paper presents both as complementary instantiations of the structural consistency principle, with voting as practical default and SJ as robust/generalizable option.
- **Priority**: P1 — narrative adjustment needed given exp_015 unified values

### R4: "No actual TTS improvement demonstrated"
- **Status**: ⚠️ CONFIRMED NEGATIVE by exp-016. Best-of-N selection DOES NOT beat greedy on NER with any signal. RE: only logprob +2.4pp over greedy.
- **Mitigation**: Paper PIVOTS to "confidence estimation + correlation-selection gap analysis." exp-006 redesigned as diagnostic: show selection curves to visualize the gap (F1 vs N per signal + oracle ceiling). The gap itself is a contribution, not a failure.
- **Priority**: P0 — narrative pivot required

### R5: "Sample size N=8 may be too small for reliable SJ estimation"
- **Mitigation**: exp-001 (N=16) with multi-seed robustness
- **Priority**: P0

### R6: "Conditional analysis cherry-picks favorable instances"
- **Mitigation**: Principled separation (knowledge-gap vs uncertainty). Add threshold sensitivity analysis. Temperature analysis provides independent validation.
- **Priority**: P0 (add sensitivity analysis)

### R7: "Only ρ as evaluation metric"
- **Mitigation**: Add AUROC, calibration plots, Kendall's τ for all experiments
- **Priority**: P0

### R8: "Formula-implementation discrepancy"
- **Mitigation**: Paper must describe actual algorithm (type-grouped Hungarian matching with max(|g_a|,|g_b|) denominator)
- **Priority**: P0, paper writing fix

### R9: "Evaluation circularity (T>0 consistency vs T=0 F1)"
- **Mitigation**: Add leave-one-out SJ evaluation as robustness check. Justify cross-mode design (greedy = deterministic reference, standard in TTS literature).
- **Priority**: P0

### R10: "Insufficient related work" (三档一致 [B][M][W])
- **Mitigation**: Expand to 35+ references. Must cite:

### R11: "SJ+logprob ensemble missing" (Dream 2 — both reviewers)
- **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED by exp-016. Results:
  - Ensemble AUROC: NER 0.735 (+3.5pp over best single), RE 0.719 (−0.2pp, no improvement)
  - Linear combo: SJ+voting best at α=0.3 (NER ρ=0.489); RE α=0.0 (pure voting)
  - FK negative coefficient in logistic regression → surface agreement is net-negative when structural signals present
  - **Interpretation**: voting_conf captures nearly all discriminative information; ensemble adds marginal value on NER, none on RE. Supports the "structural consistency family" narrative.
- **Priority**: DONE — write into paper with honest interpretation

### R12: "No supervised upper bound / reward model comparison" (Dream 2)
- **Mitigation**: Simple logistic regression on [SJ, FK, logprob, voting_conf, EM] as proxy for trained verifier (included in exp-016). Full reward model training out of scope for this paper — discuss as future work.
- **Priority**: P1 (partially addressed by exp-016 ensemble)

### R13: "Headroom capture rate low (37% NER, 11% RE)" (Dream 2)
- **Mitigation**: Discuss explicitly in paper. Contextualize vs other unsupervised TTS methods. Argue that the information-theoretic ceiling for unsupervised signals is unknown — our result establishes a baseline.
- **Priority**: P0, paper writing

### R14: "Cross-model validation thin — need more than 2×8B" (Dream 2)
- **Mitigation**: exp-017 (LLaMA on CoNLL, P1). 70B model infeasible within GPU budget. Acknowledge as limitation.
- **Priority**: P1

### R15: "Log-prob definition ambiguity — Eq.1 vs best-of-N ranking" (Dream 2 cross-tier, [W])
- **Mitigation**: Paper must clarify: log-prob ranks among N candidates (each sample's generation log-prob), not just score greedy output. Cost comparison table must state "all best-of-N require N forward passes; log-prob adds zero ranking overhead."
- **Priority**: P0, Paper Agent handles

### R16: "Zero figures — data-rich paper with only tables" (Dream 2 cross-tier, [W])
- **Mitigation**: Paper Agent must include ≥3 figures: (1) selection curves (F1 vs N for each signal + oracle), (2) reliability diagram (calibration), (3) N-scaling or cost-effectiveness scatter. Data exists from exp-010/015.
- **Priority**: P0, Paper Agent handles

### R17: "Diagnostic framework overclaimed — descriptive not prescriptive" (Dream 2 cross-tier, [M][W])
- **Mitigation**: Soften "diagnostic framework" to "diagnostic analysis" throughout. Current taxonomy (ceiling/floor/compound error) is descriptive. Either formalize with a priori metrics or reframe as empirical analysis.
- **Priority**: P0, Paper Agent handles

### R18: "No discussion of when consistency WOULD help" (Dream 2 cross-tier, [W])
- **Mitigation**: Add discussion paragraph: consistency should outperform log-prob when (a) model calibration is poor (in-context learning without fine-tuning), (b) log-prob unavailable (closed-source APIs), (c) ensemble/mixture settings, (d) tasks where model is systematically overconfident.
- **Priority**: P1, Paper Agent handles

### R19: "Negative result partially predictable for fine-tuned models" (Dream 2 cross-tier, [W])
- **Mitigation**: Paper must argue non-obviousness: (a) self-consistency demonstrably helps for reasoning tasks (Wang et al. 2023), (b) structured prediction has internal structure that surface metrics can't capture, (c) the DEGREE of log-prob's strength and the task-complexity boundary are not predictable a priori.
- **Priority**: P1, Paper Agent handles

## Venue Fit

EMNLP is well-suited for:
- Systematic empirical comparison of confidence signals for structured prediction
- Diagnostic findings with principled explanations
- The "comparison + boundary condition" contribution pattern

Risk assessment (post-Dream 2, all tiers 3/6):
- **Structural risks (三档一致)**: (1) novelty perceived as incremental, (2) related work thin, (3) single RE dataset. These are presentation/positioning issues, NOT data issues — fixable by Paper Agent.
- **Data-dependent risks (观察中)**: SJ vs LOGPROB ranking may be dataset-dependent (Dream imagined this; awaiting exp-002/003 real data). If confirmed → reframe as "complementary signals" rather than "SJ dominates."
- **Confirmed strength**: SJ >> LOGPROB on SciERC (AUROC 0.70 vs 0.59). Structural consistency family consistently top on existing data.
- **Critical path**: Paper Agent (related work 35+ refs, 3+ figures, contribution reframe) > new GPU experiments.
