1	\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
2	
3	Self-consistency---sampling multiple outputs and aggregating them---has become a powerful strategy for improving language model reasoning.
4	On discrete-answer tasks such as arithmetic and commonsense QA, majority voting over chain-of-thought samples yields large gains: +18 percentage points on GSM8K \cite{wang2023selfconsistency}.
5	More broadly, test-time compute scaling through repeated sampling and selection has emerged as a complementary axis to model scaling, offering substantial quality improvements at inference time \cite{snell2024scaling, brown2024monkeys}.
6	These results rest on a shared assumption: that among $N$ stochastic samples, a selection mechanism can identify better outputs.
7	For tasks with a single correct answer, this assumption holds naturally---the majority vote is the selector.
8	But information extraction (IE) poses a fundamentally different challenge.
9	The output is not a single token or number; it is a \textit{set} of entities or relations with internal dependencies, where two samples may extract overlapping but non-identical structures.
10	There is no obvious majority to vote on, partial agreement is the norm rather than the exception, and the space of valid outputs is combinatorially large.
11	Can self-consistency still provide useful signal in this structured setting?
12	
13	Prior work on confidence estimation for LLM-based IE has conflated two distinct objectives.
14	\textit{Quality estimation} asks which inputs the model handles reliably---a ranking over instances.
15	\textit{Sample selection} asks which of $N$ candidate outputs is best for a given input---a ranking over samples.
16	These require fundamentally different signal properties: the former benefits from instance-level aggregation across all $N$ samples, while the latter demands per-sample discrimination.
17	Existing evaluations rarely separate the two.
18	Self-consistency methods designed for discrete answers \cite{wan

3	
4	\subsection{Experimental Setup}
5	\label{sec:setup}
6	
7	\paragraph{Datasets.}
8	We evaluate on three English IE benchmarks spanning a difficulty gradient.
9	\textbf{SciERC} \cite{luan2018scierc} contains 551 test instances from scientific abstracts annotated for joint NER (6 entity types) and RE (7 relation types), representing a complex schema with overlapping structures.
10	\textbf{CoNLL-2003} \cite{tjongkimsang2003conll} provides 3{,}453 test sentences from newswire with 4 entity types, serving as a high-accuracy benchmark where models achieve ${>}$91\% micro F1.
11	\textbf{WNUT-17} \cite{derczynski2017wnut} consists of 1{,}287 test instances from social media with emerging entities, used to probe method boundaries where model capability is insufficient.
12	This gradient---from near-solved (CoNLL) through challenging (SciERC) to infeasible (WNUT-17)---enables systematic characterization of how signal effectiveness varies with task difficulty (\S\ref{sec:complexity_robustness}).
13	
14	\paragraph{Models.}
15	Our primary model is \textbf{Qwen3-8B}, fine-tuned with LoRA ($r{=}32$) separately per dataset.
16	For cross-model validation, we evaluate \textbf{LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct} to assess whether structural confidence signals transfer across architectures and training regimes.
17	
18	\paragraph{Sampling and Evaluation.}
19	For each test instance, we draw $N$ independent samples at temperature $T{=}1.0$, with $T{=}0.7$ for robustness analysis.
20	We use $N{=}8$ for both SciERC and CoNLL in the primary evaluation, and $N{=}16$ for SciERC scaling experiments.
21	Quality estimation is measured along two axes: \textit{rank correlation} with instance-level F1 via Spearman $\rho$ and Kendall $\tau$, and \textit{binary discrimination} via AUROC (instances above vs.\ below median F1).
22	Downstream utility is assessed through \textbf{best-of-$N$ selection F1}: the F1 obtained when each signal selects one sample per instan

1	\section{Discussion}\label{sec:discussion}
2	
3	\paragraph{Practical recommendations.}
4	Our results suggest different signal choices depending on the deployment scenario.
5	For per-instance quality estimation, entity voting provides the strongest single signal ($\rho{=}0.50$, Table~\ref{tab:quality_estimation}).
6	When temperature or cross-condition robustness is required, SJ is preferable: its temperature sensitivity is small with bootstrap CIs including zero (Table~\ref{tab:robustness}), and it generalizes beyond entity-level structure to any set-valued output.
7	Under conditional filtering, SJ achieves $\rho{\approx}0.4$ on both NER and RE (\S\ref{sec:complexity_robustness}), and its ensemble with voting reaches AUROC${=}0.735$.
8	For binary accept/reject decisions, logprob is most effective (AUROC${=}0.761$ on CoNLL with LLaMA).
9	For best-of-$N$ selection, greedy decoding is near-optimal on NER; on RE, logprob is the only helpful signal (+2.3~pp, Table~\ref{tab:selection}).
10	
11	\paragraph{Signals discriminate between instances, not within strata.}
12	When instances are stratified by greedy F1, within-stratum correlations approach zero for all signals.
13	Confidence signals capture \textit{between-instance} quality differences---identifying which inputs the model handles reliably---rather than providing fine-grained discrimination among instances of similar difficulty.
14	This is the complementary face of the correlation-selection gap (\S\ref{sec:selection_gap}): signals that predict input difficulty cannot rank outputs within a difficulty stratum.
15	The practical implication is that these signals are well-suited for routing and triage---flagging uncertain instances for human review---but not for fine-grained ranking within a difficulty tier.
16	
17	\paragraph{Task-difficulty-dependent signal selection.}
18	Across all three $N{=}16$ settings, the structural-over-logprob ordering holds consistently (\S\ref{sec:complexity_robustness}).
19	However, the \text

    "content": "Our evaluation covers three datasets but only one RE benchmark (SciERC), where 44\\% of instances receive zero F1, compressing the discriminable range and limiting signal differentiation for relation extraction.\nWNUT-17 confirms the capability boundary of our approach, but our positive results on formal-domain text (CoNLL, SciERC) have not been validated on informal or noisy text where models achieve non-trivial performance.\n\nWe evaluate two model families (Qwen3-8B and LLaMA-3.1-8B), both at 8B parameters.\nWhether our findings---particularly the correlation-selection gap and the structural-over-surface signal ordering---hold for larger models (70B+) or closed-source APIs remains untested.\nLarger models may produce higher-quality and more diverse samples, potentially altering the signal landscape.\n\nOur analysis of selection potential uses unsupervised signals and a logistic regression proxy as an upper bound.\nWe do not train a dedicated verifier or reward model, leaving unknown how much of the oracle headroom a supervised approach could recover.\n\nWe evaluate at $N{=}8$ and $N{=}16$.\nThe behavior of confidence signals at larger sample sizes (e.g., $N{=}64$ or $N{=}128$) is unknown, and $N$-scaling gains are setting-dependent: SJ improves by $+0.071$ on Qwen SciERC NER but only $+0.016$ on LLaMA SciERC NER when doubling from $N{=}8$ to $N{=}16$.\n\nOn CoNLL, the SJ--FK gap is only 0.004 ($\\rho{=}0.436$ vs.\\ $0.431$ for LLaMA), so the structural advantage over surface signals may not generalize to all simple-schema datasets.\nFinally, log-probability was excluded from the temperature comparison ($T{=}0.7$ vs.\\ $T{=}1.0$) due to missing $T{=}0.7$ logprob data, leaving its temperature sensitivity uncharacterized.\n"

### Assistant

_source line 23 · 2026-05-14T21:10:29.590216+00:00_

三个文件已写入并注册：

1. **abstract.tex** — 6 句，~195 words。3 个数字（ρ=0.50, AUROC=0.73, +2.3 pp），覆盖 problem→approach→findings→implication 结构。
2. **conclusion.tex** — ~290 words。Summary 重述贡献框架而非重复 abstract；C1/C2/C3 各一句话 recap；4 个 future work 方向（trained verifiers, cross-task transfer, conformal prediction, scaling analysis）。
3. **limitations.tex** — ~210 words，纯段落无 section 标题。覆盖全部 6 项：RE 单数据集 + 44% zero-F1、2 个 8B 模型、无 supervised verifier、N=8/16 范围 + setting-dependent gains、CoNLL SJ-FK gap 0.004、logprob 无 T=0.7 数据。

所有数字与 introduction.tex / experiments.tex 一致。无禁忌用语。
