````text
Let me now also look for more compression opportunities. Let me check if there are more things I can trim in the Introduction, like the opening paragraph.

The introduction paragraph 1 (lines 1-11) is 11 lines. Can I compress it?

```
Self-consistency---sampling multiple outputs and aggregating them---has become a powerful strategy for improving language model reasoning.
On discrete-answer tasks such as arithmetic and commonsense QA, majority voting over chain-of-thought samples yields large gains: +18 percentage points on GSM8K (PaLM-540B; \citealp{wang2023selfconsistency}).


```

Now I'm thinking about how test-time compute scaling through repeated sampling has become a key way to improve model outputs without changing the model itself. The core assumption is that you can identify better outputs from multiple samples, which works well for tasks with single correct answers through majority voting. But information extraction is fundamentally different---the output is a set of entities or relations with dependencies, so two samples might extract overlapping but different structures, making it unclear how to select the best one. I'm working through how to tighten the introduction by compressing several key passages. The main idea is that self-consistency works well for discrete tasks with clear majorities, but information extraction presents a fundamentally different problem—the outputs are structured sets with dependencies and no obvious consensus mechanism, making the space of valid answers combinatorially large. I'm also noting that while consistency signals can estimate quality reasonably well, they fail at actually selecting better samples, which is the core tension I want to highlight early on. I'm distinguishing between two types of confidence signals: per-sample signals that score each output independently for ranking, and instance-level signals that aggregate across all samples to produce a single score per input. This asymmetry between predicting which inputs are easy versus selecting which output is best is what drives the correlation-selection gap I'm exploring. , while instance-level signals only tell us which inputs are problematic, not which specific outputs are better. The detailed notation is in the appendix. We define confidence signals as an umbrella term covering five measures: four consistency signals based on inter-sample agreement—structural ones like Soft Jaccard and entity voting confidence, plus surface-level ones like exact match and Fleiss' kappa—and log-probability as the sole model-based signal.

<details><summary>Logged reasoning block</summary>

Let me calculate the savings compared to original:

Original line counts (from my initial reading):
- abstract.tex: ~9 lines
- introduction.tex: ~43 lines
- related_work.tex: ~30 lines
- method.tex: ~77 lines (including eqs)
- experiments.tex: ~121 lines (including tables)
- discussion.tex: ~28 lines
- conclusion.tex: ~8 lines (approximating from 7+1 blank)
- limitations.tex: ~27 lines

Original total: ~343 lines
New total: 292 lines

Savings: 51 lines


Now I'm converting this to rendered page space. In the ACL 2-column format, about 55-60 lines fit per column with typical wrapping, so those 51 source lines translate to roughly 66 rendered lines or about 1.2 columns. But I need to account for the fact that equations and footnotes don't compress the same way as regular text, and the Method section's equations weren't affected by my text cuts, so the actual page savings is probably closer to 0.6 pages from the text compression alone.

Looking at where the cuts came from, the biggest reductions were in the Method section (14 lines, mostly from condensing the VC footnote, FK independence explanation, and SJ description) and the Limitations section (13 lines). The Introduction lost 6 lines, Related Work 5, Experiments 8, Discussion 4, and Conclusion 2. That's 52 lines total removed across all sections.

In the ACL two-column format, I'm estimating each column holds about 55 lines of 10pt text, and source lines typically wrap to around 1.3 rendered lines on average. So 52 source lines would translate to roughly 67 rendered lines, or about 1.2 columns—less than a full page saved.

But there are other factors at play. The VC footnote compression alone saves about 0.5cm of space, and the Limitations section shrinking from 0.7 pages to 0.4 pages gives another 0.3 pages. Combined with the text compression, I'm looking at roughly 0.9 to 1.2 pages of savings total. If the original was 10-11 pages, that gets me to 9-10 pages, but I need to hit 8 pages or less.

I need to be more aggressive. Let me consider what else could be cut—maybe some of the experimental details or further condensing the method descriptions. I'm reviewing which figures and tables are currently in the main body. Figure 1 is essential context in the introduction, and Tables 1 and 2 are core experimental results that should stay. Figure 2, the heatmap, takes up about half a page and while it's referenced in the results and filtering sections, moving it to the appendix is allowed since the task only prohibits deleting data. I can update those references to point to the appendix instead, which would free up meaningful space. I'm considering trimming the table captions too—they're quite verbose with all the methodological details. The quality estimation caption is especially long with all the task specifications and cross-references. I could condense these significantly by moving some of the explanatory text to the appendix or main text, keeping just the essential information in the captions themselves. I can trim the constrained decoding mention from the intro since it's already covered in the Setup section, and the ablation results are discussed later anyway—that saves a line plus the footnote space.

Now looking at the central finding: there's a correlation-selection gap where consistency signals estimate quality well but fail at actually selecting good samples, even though there's room for improvement. Most signals are instance-level by design, with log-probability being the exception.

I should keep this core insight intact and move forward with relocating Figure 2 to the appendix and making other space-saving edits.

Estimated ~52 source lines saved so far. For ACL 2-column, we need more. Moving the signal heatmap figure to appendix will save ~0.4 pages, which combined with text compression should reach the target.

See \\S\\ref{sec:setup} and Limitations for discussion of this confound.}\n\n\\section{Thinking Token Impact Analysis}\\label{app:thinking_token}\n\nQwen3-8B's SciERC checkpoint was trained with empty \\texttt{&lt;think>&lt;/think>} blocks prepended to each response (\\S\\ref{sec:setup}).\nWe quantify the potential impact on LP scores through three complementary arguments.\n\n\\paragraph{LP shift magnitude.}\nThe 4--5 thinking tokens contribute an estimated LP shift of 0.001 nats to the per-token log-probability average, representing 2.68\\% of the median within-instance LP range (0.041 nats).\nThis shift is too small to alter LP-based rankings.\n\n\\paragraph{Constant prefix cancellation.}\nAll $N$ samples within an instance share the same prompt and, under constrained decoding, the same absence of thinking tokens at inference time.\nAny LP bias from the training-time thinking prefix is therefore a near-constant additive shift across all candidates within an instance, leaving within-instance LP \\textit{rankings} unchanged.\n\n\\paragraph{CoNLL control group.}\nCoNLL and WNUT-17 checkpoints were trained without thinking tokens (\\texttt{enable\\_thinking=False}).\nIf thinking tokens caused LP compression on SciERC, CoNLL should exhibit lower tied fractions.\nInstead, CoNLL shows \\textit{higher} tied fractions at both temperatures (86.8\\% at $T{=}1.0$, 95.8\\% at $T{=}0.7$) than SciERC (60.3\\% at $T{=}1.0$), directly contradicting the thinking-token hypothesis.\n\n\\section{Log-Probability Score Compression}\\label{app:logprob_ties}\n\nUnder constrained decoding, log-probability scores are severely compressed within instances, limiting per-sample discrimination (Table~\\ref{tab:logprob_ties}, Figure~\\ref{fig:lp_range_cdf}).\nThe median within-instance LP range is only 0.041 nats---below the $\\varepsilon{=}0.05$ threshold used throughout, providing data-driven justification for this cutoff rather than an arbitrary choice.\nAt $\\varepsilon{=}0.05$, 60.3\\% of instances ($n{=}529$, excluding empty gold annotations) have a within-sample range below the threshold, and 75\\% of pairwise comparisons are effective ties ($|\\Delta|{<}0.026$).\nThe CDF rises smoothly with no cliff or discontinuity (Figure~\\ref{fig:lp_range_cdf}), confirming that compression is a pervasive regime rather than a bimodal split.\nThis compression is stable across seeds: seed${=}456$ yields median LP range${=}0.040$ nats and tied fraction${=}62.2\\%$ (vs.\\ seed${=}42$: $0.041$ nats, $60.3\\%$).\nFor comparison, SJ has only 12.5\\% tied instances at the same threshold---SJ's advantage over LP for selection is one of score resolution, not information content.\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{fig_lp_range_cdf}\n\\caption{CDF of within-instance LP range on SciERC NER ($N{=}8$, $n{=}529$).

````text
Good. Let me now do a final line count and estimate the page savings.

Actually, let me also check if the introduction still references the constrained decoding footnote elsewhere, and whether removing it creates issues. The free-form ablation is discussed in the Discussion section (\S\ref{sec:ablation}) and in the appendix. The intro previously had:

```
All experiments use constrained decoding \cite{willard2023guided}, the standard for schema-compliant IE output.\footnote{Our free-form ablation (\S\ref{sec:ablation}) confirms fine-tuned models produce 99.95\% valid JSON without grammar constraints.}


```

Now this is removed. The Setup section mentions constrained decoding with vLLM, and the Discussion covers the free-form ablation, so I'm not losing any critical information by cutting that footnote. Let me do a final pass through the introduction to make sure everything still flows properly.

1	\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
2	
3	Self-consistency---sampling multiple outputs and aggregating them---has become a powerful strategy for improving language model reasoning.
4	On discrete-answer tasks, majority voting over chain-of-thought samples yields large gains---+18~pp on GSM8K \citep{wang2023selfconsistency}---and test-time compute scaling has emerged as a complementary axis to model scaling \cite{snell2025scaling, brown2024monkeys}.
5	These results assume that among $N$ stochastic samples, a selection mechanism can identify better outputs; for tasks with a single answer, majority voting is the selector.
6	But information extraction (IE) poses a structurally different challenge: the output is a \textit{set} of entities or relations with internal dependencies, two samples may extract overlapping but non-identical structures, and there is no obvious majority to vote on.
7	Can self-consistency still provide useful signal in this structured setting?
8	
9	Prior work on confidence estimation for LLM-based IE has conflated two distinct objectives: \textit{quality estimation} (which inputs does the model handle reliably?) and \textit{sample selection} (which of $N$ outputs is best?).
10	Self-consistency methods for reasoning \cite{wang2023selfconsistency, chen2024usc} and weighted variants \cite{taubenfeld2025cisc, kang2025selfcertainty} assume outputs can be grouped by equivalence---an assumption that breaks for entity sets with partial overlap.
11	\citet{yao2026consistency} examine consistency--accuracy correlations for LLM-based IE; our work extends theirs with structural matching, a selection analysis, and a difficulty gradient.
12	
13	Our central finding is the \textbf{correlation-selection gap} (Figure~\ref{fig:overview}): consistency signals achieve strong quality estimation ($\rho$ up to 0.45) but fail at sample selection despite substantial oracle headroom.
14	Four of five signals are instance-level by construction; log-probability, the only per-sample signal, is too compressed to discriminate (\S\ref{sec:discussion}), though where compression is mitigated, selection recovers gains (\S\ref{sec:ablation}).
15

18	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{fig_overview}
19	\caption{The correlation-selection gap. \textbf{Left}: high inter-sample agreement correlates with high F1 (quality estimation). \textbf{Right}: instance-level signals assign identical scores to all candidates, precluding sample selection.}
20	\label{fig:overview}
21	\end{figure*}
22	
23	We compare five confidence signals from three families---structural, surface, and model-internal---across NER and RE on SciERC \cite{luan2018scierc}, CoNLL-2003 \cite{tjongkimsang2003conll}, and WNUT-17 \cite{derczynski2017wnut}, using Qwen3-8B and LLaMA-3.1-8B.
24	Our contributions are:
25	\begin{enumerate}
26	    \item \textbf{Metric dissociation.}
27	    We find that quality estimation, binary discrimination, and sample selection decouple, so single-metric evaluation risks selecting the wrong signal.
28	
29	    \item \textbf{The correlation-selection gap.}
30	    Despite strong quality estimation, no signal improves sample selection: log-probability scores are too compressed within instances, and MBR-style selection correlates with F1 across but not within instances.
31	
32	    \item \textbf{Difficulty- and task-dependent signal rankings.}
33	    Signal rankings shift with task complexity and type, and collapse at the capability boundary. RE conclusions rest on SciERC alone (preliminary).

4	\subsection{Experimental Setup}
5	\label{sec:setup}
6	
7	\paragraph{Datasets.}
8	We evaluate on three English IE benchmarks spanning a difficulty gradient.
9	\textbf{SciERC} \cite{luan2018scierc} contains 551 test instances annotated for joint NER (6 types) and RE (7 types).
10	\textbf{CoNLL-2003} \cite{tjongkimsang2003conll} provides 3{,}453 test sentences with 4 entity types, where models achieve ${\approx}$91\% micro F1.
11	\textbf{WNUT-17} \cite{derczynski2017wnut} consists of 1{,}287 social media instances with emerging entities, used to probe method boundaries (52\% zero F1).
12	
13	\paragraph{Models and sampling.}
14	Both \textbf{Qwen3-8B} and \textbf{LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct} are fine-tuned with LoRA (rank$=$32, $\alpha{=}64$) for 5 epochs using LLaMA Factory \cite{zheng2024llamafactory} under identical training procedures.
15	Qwen3-8B's SciERC checkpoint has a minor train--test mismatch (empty thinking tokens); a quantitative analysis rules out this confound (Appendix~\ref{app:thinking_token}).
16	We draw $N{=}8$ samples at $T{=}1.0$ (primary), with $N{=}16$ for scaling experiments.\footnote{$N$-scaling analysis (Appendix~\ref{app:n_scaling}) shows sublinear gains beyond $N{=}8$; 3-seed stability ($\sigma{\leq}0.026$; Table~\ref{tab:multiseed}) confirms identical signal rankings across seeds.}
17	Inference uses vLLM with constrained decoding \cite{willard2023guided}.

Selection F1 is stable across $\varepsilon \in [0, 0.2]$ (Appendix~\ref{app:epsilon_robustness}).}
45	
46	\paragraph{Difficulty-dependent signal complementarity.}
47	On SciERC NER, structural signals lead: VC $\rho{=}0.379$, SJ $\rho{=}0.360$, outperforming surface ($\rho{\leq}0.295$) and LP ($\rho{=}0.205$); on RE (preliminary), LP rises above SJ and FK in multi-seed analysis (Table~\ref{tab:multiseed}), likely because RE's 40\% zero-F1 rate favors generation confidence.
48	The best NER AUROC reaches 0.816 (EM, CoNLL Qwen); pairwise bootstrap CIs confirm the SJ--LP gap ($\Delta\rho{=}{+}0.155$, CI excludes zero; Appendix~\ref{app:bootstrap_signal}).
49	Signal choice depends on use case: EM leads AUROC but not $\rho$ on CoNLL, preferred for binary triage; this $\rho$--AUROC dissociation replicates across configurations.
50	
51	\paragraph{Signal rankings shift with task difficulty.}
52	On CoNLL (greedy F1${\approx}$0.91), EM leads; on SciERC, structural signals dominate---demonstrating difficulty-dependent complementarity consistent across model families.
53	On WNUT-17 (52\% zero F1), all conditional signals collapse (Table~\ref{tab:wnut}), suggesting a capability boundary beyond which consistency captures binary success/failure but not quality gradation.
54	Restricting to non-zero F1 instances reshuffles rankings (Figure~\ref{fig:signal_heatmap}, Appendix~\ref{app:additional}): EM emerges as the strongest conditional signal on both NER ($\rho{=}0.360$) and RE ($\rho{=}0.417$; preliminary), while LP RE collapses to $\rho{=}0.011$.

82	\bottomrule
83	\end{tabular}
84	\end{table}
85	
86	Despite strong quality estimation, confidence signals yield limited gains for best-of-$N$ selection (Table~\ref{tab:selection}; see also Figure~\ref{fig:selection_gap}).
87	Four of five signals are instance-level by construction (they assign identical scores to all candidates); the non-trivial question is whether LP---the only per-sample signal---can exploit the oracle headroom.
88	We anchor on SciERC, where output diversity is substantial (39--43\% unique outputs; Appendix~\ref{app:diversity}).
89	
90	\paragraph{No significant improvement over greedy.}
91	We evaluate significance via 2-seed instance-level sign tests ($n{=}551$, Fisher combination).
92	On NER, the oracle (0.778) reveals 13.3~pp of headroom above greedy (0.645).
93	LP achieves the highest mean selection F1 (0.647), indistinguishable from greedy ($\Delta{=}{+}0.2$~pp, $p{=}0.29$); all other signals also fail to reach significance (all $p{>}0.05$; Table~\ref{tab:selection}).
94	On RE, the best signal (LP, 0.395) falls below greedy (0.404; single seed, preliminary), while 18.1~pp of oracle headroom remains.
95	The pattern is consistent across CoNLL and WNUT-17 (Table~\ref{tab:cross_selection}).
96	
97	\paragraph{Quality estimation $\neq$ output selection.}
98	Instance-level signals predict \textit{which inputs} the model handles reliably, not \textit{which output} is best; when per-sample variance is low, even perfect quality estimation fails to discriminate.
99	Closing this gap likely requires per-sample signals such as trained verifiers \cite{cobbe2021verifiers}.
100	
101	%% ============================================================
102	\subsection{Robustness}
103	\label{sec:robustness_main}
104	
105	Consistency-based signals (SJ, FK, EM, VC) are robust across $T{\in}\{0.7, 1.0\}$ and show sublinear gains from $N{=}8$ to $N{=}16$ (Table~\ref{tab:robustness}, Appendix~\ref{app:robustness}); LP is excluded from this robustness claim, exhibiting the largest temperature sensitivity ($\Delta\rho{=}{+}0.044$ on NER).
106	NER signals are reasonably calibrated (ECE 0.069--0.096; Appendix~\ref{app:calibration}); RE miscalibration (ECE up to 0.339, preliminary) imposes a ceiling at $\rho{\approx}0.28$ for $N{=}16$.

```text
1	\section{Method}\label{sec:method}
2	
3	\subsection{Problem Formulation}\label{sec:formulation}
4	
5	Given model $\mathcal{M}$ and input $x$, we sample $N$ structured outputs $\{y_1, \ldots, y_N\}$ at temperature $T > 0$ via constrained decoding \cite{willard2023guided}, where each $y_i$ is an entity set (NER) or relation set (RE).
6	A \textbf{per-sample signal} $c_{\text{ps}}: (x, y_i) \to \mathbb{R}$ scores each output independently; an \textbf{instance-level signal} $c_{\text{il}}: (x, \{y_i\}_{i=1}^N) \to \mathbb{R}$ produces a single score per input.
7	This asymmetry is central to the correlation-selection gap: instance-level signals predict \textit{which inputs} are easy, not \textit{which output} is best (notation in Appendix~\ref{app:notation}).
8	
9	\subsection{Confidence Signals}\label{sec:signals}
10	
11	Four signals are \textit{consistency signals} from two families: \textit{structural} (Soft Jaccard [SJ], entity voting confidence [VC]) and \textit{surface} (exact match [EM], Fleiss' $\kappa$ [FK]); log-probability [LP] is the sole \textit{model-internal} signal and the only per-sample one.
12	
13	\paragraph{Log-probability (model-internal, per-sample).}
14	The only per-sample signal.
15	For sample $y_i$ with tokens $t_1, \ldots, t_{|y_i|}$:
16	\begin{equation}\label{eq:logprob}
17	c_{\text{lp}}(y_i) = \frac{1}{|y_i|} \sum_{j=1}^{|y_i|} \log p_{\mathcal{M}}(t_j \mid t_{&lt;j}, x)
18	\end{equation}
19	
20	\paragraph{Exact match voting (surface, instance-level).}
21	The majority fraction---the proportion of samples producing the most common output:
22	\begin{equation}\label{eq:em}
23	c_{\text{em}}(x) = \frac{1}{N} \max_{y} \big|\{i : y_i = y\}\big|
24	\end{equation}
25	
26	\paragraph{Fleiss' $\kappa$ (surface, instance-level).}
27	We adapt \citet{fleiss1971agreement} to entity sets: items are unique (text, type) tuples across all $N$ samples; each sample assigns binary present/absent labels, yielding a $|E_\cup| \times 2$ rating matrix:
28	\begin{equation}\label{eq:fk}
29	\kappa = \frac{\bar{P} - \bar{P}_e}{1 - \bar{P}_e}
30	\end{equation}
31	where $\bar{P}$ is mean observed pairwise agreement and $\bar{P}_e$ is expected agreement under random assignment.
32	Temperature-based sampling introduces mild negative dependence (excess agreement $-$0.4\% to $-$4.0\%), which does not inflate FK.
33	Unlike structural signals, FK relies on exact string matching.
34	
35	\paragraph{Soft Jaccard (structural, instance-level).}
36	Extends Jaccard similarity \cite{jaccard1901distribution} to entity/relation sets.
37	For samples $y_i, y_j$, we group extractions by type, compute max-weight bipartite matching via the Hungarian algorithm (maximizing token-level IoU), and define:
38	\begin{equation}\label{eq:sj}
39	\text{SJ}(y_i, y_j) = \frac{\sum_{m \in M} \text{sim}(a_m, b_m)}{\sum_{g} \max(|g_i|, |g_j|)}
40	\end{equation}
41	where $M$ is the matched set, $\text{sim}(a_m, b_m)$ is the token-level IoU between matched spans, and $\max(|g_i|, |g_j|)$ penalizes length asymmetry.
42	The instance-level signal averages over all pairs:
43	\begin{equation}\label{eq:sj_instance}
44	c_{\text{sj}}(x) = \frac{1}{\binom{N}{2}} \sum_{i&lt;j} \text{SJ}(y_i, y_j)
45	\end{equation}
46	
47	\paragraph{Entity voting confidence (structural, instance-level).}
48	For each entity $e$ in the union $E_\cup$ of all samples, we compute frequency $\text{freq}(e) = |\{i : e \in y_i\}| / N$.
49	The instance-level confidence is the mean frequency:
50	\begin{equation}\label{eq:voting}
51	c_{\text{vote}}(x) = \frac{1}{|E_\cup|} \sum_{e \in E_\cup} \text{freq}(e)
52	\end{equation}
53	When $E_\cup = \emptyset$, we set $c_{\mathrm{vc}}(x) = 0$.\footnote{Equation~\ref{eq:voting} defines the continuous QE signal; for voted-output \textit{selection} (Table~\ref{tab:selection}), we include only entities with frequency ${>}N/2$, following standard majority voting.}
54	
55	\subsection{Evaluation Framework}\label{sec:evaluation}
56	
57	\paragraph{Quality estimation.}
58	We measure rank correlation (Spearman $\rho$) between the confidence signal and instance-level F1, and binary discrimination (AUROC) by classifying instances as above or below median F1.
59	Correlation analyses exclude instances with empty gold annotations ($n{=}529$ on SciERC after filtering 22/551); selection analyses retain the full set ($n{=}551$).
60	
61	\paragraph{Sample selection.}
62	We report best-of-$N$ F1: per-sample signals (LP) directly rank candidates; instance-level signals select the sample closest to the consensus output.
63	We compare against an \textit{oracle} (highest-F1 sample) and a \textit{greedy} baseline (a fixed $T{=}1.0$ sample).
64

Everything looks clean and consistent. Let me now do a final line count and calculate the total savings.

Let me also check for any dangling references. The heatmap figure was moved to appendix, so the label `fig:signal_heatmap` should still be valid. Let me verify that the appendix has it correctly.

Also, I need to check: the introduction no longer mentions constrained decoding before the central finding paragraph. Is this OK? The constrained decoding is mentioned in the Setup section. The ablation (\S\ref{sec:ablation}) is still referenced in the introduction line 14. The constrained decoding footnote about 99.95% parse rate was useful but not essential.


Now I'm verifying the reference chain holds up—checking that all the citations and cross-references in the introduction still point to valid locations throughout the document.

Let me calculate the total savings:

Original line counts (estimated from initial read):
- abstract.tex: ~9 lines (the original was 9 lines)
- introduction.tex: ~43 lines (42 content + 1 blank)
- related_work.tex: ~30 lines (29 content + 1 blank)
- method.tex: ~77 lines
- experiments.tex: ~121 lines
- discussion.tex: ~28 lines
- conclusion.tex: ~8 lines
- limitations.tex: ~27 lines
Total: ~343 lines

New totals: 283 lines


Total savings: ~60 lines

Now I'm converting this to actual page savings. With the 60 lines of text reduction and the removal of that full-width heatmap figure, I'm looking at roughly 1.1 to 1.2 pages freed up in the final ACL 2-column format.

So if the original manuscript was around 10 pages, I'm down to approximately 8.8 to 9 pages—still slightly over the 8-page limit. I need to find additional cuts.

Let me reconsider what actually counts toward the page limit. The main content sections, tables, and figures in the body count, but the Limitations section, Ethics Statement, and References don't. For ARR/ACL submissions, the main paper is capped at 8 pages, so I need to trim another page or so from the core content. So the page-counted sections total around 269 lines, with Figure 1 and Table 1 taking up full-width space, and Table 2 as a single-column float. Figure 2 has already been moved out of the main body, which helps with space.

Now I'm working through a more precise page layout estimate. The title and abstract take up about 0.4 pages, with Figure 1 occupying another 0.4 pages, leaving just a bit of room for the introduction to start. The introduction continues onto page 2 where related work begins, and related work extends into page 3 before the method section kicks in. The method section spans pages 3 through 5, with Table 1 taking up about 0.4 pages on page 4. The experiments section starts around page 5 and continues from there.

Looking at the remaining content, I'm identifying a few specific areas where I could trim more text—the LP equation description, a sentence in the introduction about Yao, and a somewhat redundant line in the experiments section. I'm also considering whether tightening the spacing around equations in the method section could help. At this point, I think the best move is to actually compile the paper and check the real page count rather than continuing to estimate.

Looking at the PDF, I can see that:
- Page 8 starts with references on the left column and the Appendix (Section A: Notation) starts on the right column
- This means the main body (Abstract through Conclusion) ends on page 7, and the references + appendix start on page 8

Wait, let me re-read the page. Page 8 shows:
- Left column: references (continuing from page 7)
- Right column: Section A (Notation) starts at line 679

So the references are on page 8, and the appendix starts on page 8 too.

But where does the main body end? Let me check pages 7-8 more carefully. 

I need to locate where the Limitations section falls—it should come after the Conclusion but before the references start. Looking at the text extraction, Limitations appears around line 1139, so I need to examine pages 7-8 to pinpoint where the body content actually ends.

Looking at the PDF:

**Page 7**: All references (both columns are references only)
**Page 8**: 
- Left column: More references (ending around line 635)
- Right column top: Last references, then **Section A: Notation** starts at line 679, followed by **Section B: Robustness Analysis** at line 682

So the references span pages 7-8, and the appendix starts on page 8 right column.

Now let me check where the main body ends. Let me look at pages 5-7.

Now I can see the layout clearly:

**Page 5**: 
- Top: Table 1 (QE results) and Table 2 (selection) 
- Left column: End of Selection Gap section + Robustness (Section 4.4)
- Right column: Discussion (Section 5) starts at line 335

**Page 6**:
- Left column: End of Discussion (Methodological implications) lines 372-380, then **Section 6: Conclusion** starts at line 381, then **Limitations** starts at line 399
- Right column: Limitations continues, then **Ethics Statement** at line 440, then **References** start at line 454


- **Page 7**: All references (both columns)
- **Page 8**: References end, then Appendix starts

The main body wraps up around line 398 on page 6's left column, which puts the core content at roughly 5.3 pages total. Let me double-check this calculation since the [review] option might affect the layout.

Looking more carefully at page 5, I see Tables 1 and 2 at the top, followed by QE results and the Selection gap discussion. Section 4.4 on Robustness appears at line 325, then Section 5 Discussion kicks in around line 335 on the right column. By page 6, the Methodological implications wrap up at line 380, the Conclusion section starts at line 381 and ends around line 398, with Limitations beginning at line 399 and the Ethics Statement appearing at line 440. References start at line 454. So the actual main body—from Abstract through Conclusion—spans pages 1 through 6, with page 6 containing just the tail end of the Discussion and the full Conclusion before Limitations begins. I need to check the earlier pages to understand the full document structure and verify whether the 10-11 page count includes the appendix or represents the original length before my compression.

So the main body spans pages 1-6, with the Conclusion wrapping up around 40% down page 6. That puts the main content at roughly 5.5 pages—well under the 8-page limit. But wait, let me double-check this count since that feels short for a full paper.

Looking more carefully: the Abstract and Introduction take up page 1, Introduction and Related Work span pages 2-3, Methods and Experiments occupy pages 4-5, and the Discussion and Conclusion finish on page 6. Page 6 also contains Limitations and Ethics before References begin. So the actual body content is about 5.4 pages, which comfortably fits within the constraints.

The original claim of 10-11 pages for the body might have included references or appendices, or the paper was previously longer. Either way, the current version clearly stays well under the 8-page limit at around 5.5 pages total.

Now I'll wrap up with a final summary.

## Summary

### (a) Per-section compression

| Section | Change | Est. savings |
|---|---|---|
| **Abstract** | Rewrote to problem-finding-significance; removed signal abbreviations and specific numbers; added free-form ablation mention; removed "significantly" without test | ~2 lines |
| **Introduction** | Compressed opening (11→5 lines), prior work paragraph (5→3 lines), removed redundant constrained decoding line+footnote, simplified signal comparison paragraph | ~8 lines |
| **Related Work** | Compressed "Consistency for structured IE" (6→3 lines), compressed "Uncertainty estimation" (10→8 lines), expanded Eikema MBR discussion (+3 sentences) | ~5 lines |
| **Method** | Compressed Problem Formulation (7→3 lines), signal intro (3→1 line), FK independence (4→2 lines), SJ description (6→4 lines), VC footnote (5→1 line), Evaluation Framework (10→4 lines) | ~14 lines |
| **Experiments** | Moved signal heatmap figure to appendix (~0.4 page), merged QE paragraphs, compressed selection gap, trimmed table captions | ~15 lines + figure |
| **Discussion** | Removed detailed LP stats (reference appendix instead), compressed N-scaling, compressed ablation, added LP IQR continuous measure | ~4 lines |
| **Conclusion** | Compressed from 5→4 sentences, added LP IQR | ~2 lines |
| **Limitations** | Compressed from 27→14 lines (merged paragraphs, removed redundant detail) | ~13 lines |

### (b) Page estimate
**Main body: ~5.5 pages** (verified by compilation). Well under 8-page limit.

### (c) Review issues resolved

| Issue | Status |
|---|---|
| **R8-N1**: Page compression to ≤8 | ✅ ~5.5 pages body |
| **R8-N2**: Title "Struggle to Select" | ✅ Already correct |
| **R4-W2/R8**: Abstract simplification | ✅ Problem-finding-significance, no signal abbrevs |
| **R7-W4**: Qwen2.5-7B → Qwen3-8B | ✅ Already correct |
| **R8-M1**: nedellec2026 → yao2026consistency | ✅ Already correct |
| **R7-W3**: Eikema discussion in Related Work | ✅ 3 sentences added |
| **R7-W2**: Contribution 1 finding-as-subject | ✅ Already "We find that..." |
| **R7-C2**: LP continuous measure (IQR) | ✅ Added in Discussion + Conclusion |
| **R7-W1**: Robustness exclude LP | ✅ Explicit exclusion |
| **R7-W1**: Limitations LP temperature | ✅ Preserved in compressed Limitations |
| **R8-W3**: SJ normalizer sensitivity | ✅ CoNLL ρ values added to Appendix |
| **R8-W1**: Ethics Statement | ✅ Sufficient (code release, data sources, no human data) |
| **ε robustness** | ✅ Already noted in footnote + appendix |
