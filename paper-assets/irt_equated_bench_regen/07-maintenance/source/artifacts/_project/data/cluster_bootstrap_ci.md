# SF1: Cluster Bootstrap — Family-level CI for Temporal C%

## Family Distribution

- **Filter**: only families with size >= 3 (among models with cohort ∈ {2023, 2024})
- **Before filter**: 33 families
- **After filter**: 29 families, 1882 models
- **Size distribution**: min=3, median=24, max=547
- **Top 5 families**: mistral (547), llama-3 (315), llama-2 (161), mixtral (120), solar (91)

## Bootstrap Results (B = 1000)

| Metric | Cluster Bootstrap | Model Bootstrap |
|--------|------------------|-----------------|
| Point estimate C% | 31.30% | 31.30% |
| 95% CI | [26.73%, 53.17%] | [29.23%, 37.75%] |
| CI width | 26.44 pp | 8.52 pp |
| Mean | 38.83% | 33.02% |
| SD | 6.79% | 2.19% |

**CI width ratio (cluster / model)**: 3.10×

## Key Observation: Complete Family–Cohort Confounding

Every family falls entirely in one cohort — no family spans both 2023 and 2024.
This means resampling families simultaneously changes the reference/focal composition,
which is the dominant driver of the wide cluster CI (and the upward bias in the
cluster bootstrap mean: 38.83% vs point estimate 31.30%).

## Interpretation

The cluster bootstrap CI is 3.10× wider than the model-level CI.
Two sources contribute:

1. **Within-family response correlation**: models from the same family produce
   similar item-level patterns, reducing the effective sample size.
2. **Family–cohort confounding**: because each family belongs entirely to one
   cohort, resampling families changes the reference/focal ratio, amplifying
   variability in the MH statistics.

Both CIs exclude zero (lower bound 26.73% for cluster, 29.23% for model),
confirming that the C% finding is robust regardless of bootstrap method.
Even under the more conservative cluster bootstrap, at least ~27% of items
show large DIF.
