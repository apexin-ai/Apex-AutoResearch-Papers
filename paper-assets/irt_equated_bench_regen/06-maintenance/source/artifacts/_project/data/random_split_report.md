# Random-Split |Δ_MH| Null Distribution Report

## Setup
- Cohort: 2023 models (N = 1080)
- Items: J = 12508
- Splits: 100 random permutations (each 540 ref vs 540 foc)
- Strata: 5 total-score quantile bins
- Total (item × split) observations: 1,250,800
- Runtime: 2.5s

## Null Distribution Percentiles

| Percentile | |Δ_MH| |
|------------|--------|
| 50th | 0.2956 |
| 90th | 0.7911 |
| 95th | 0.9898 |
| 97.5th | 1.1874 |
| 99th | 1.4504 |
| 99.5th | 1.6536 |
| 99.9th | 2.1998 |

## ETS Threshold Comparison

- Fraction of (item, split) with |Δ_MH| ≥ 1.0 (B threshold): 0.048206 (4.8206%)
- Fraction of (item, split) with |Δ_MH| ≥ 1.5 (C threshold): 0.008480 (0.8480%)
- Items that exceed |Δ_MH| ≥ 1.5 in at least one split: 3717 / 12508 (29.72%)

### ETS C Classification (joint criterion: |Δ_MH| ≥ 1.5 AND p < 0.05)

- Mean null C% per split: 0.6247%
- C% range across splits: [0.0640%, 5.8523%]
- Fraction of (item, split) classified C: 0.006247 (0.6247%)
- Items classified C in at least one split: 3702 / 12508 (29.60%)

## Interpretation

**P95 = 0.9898** (vs ETS B = 1.0): under random splitting, ~5% of item-level |Δ_MH| values approach B-level magnitude purely by chance.

**P99 = 1.4504** (vs ETS C = 1.5): the null 99th percentile nearly reaches the C threshold, meaning ~1% of items can show |Δ_MH| ≥ 1.45 by sampling noise alone.

**Null C% = 0.6247%** (joint criterion: |Δ_MH| ≥ 1.5 AND p < 0.05). The observed temporal C% is ~0.18% (2023→2024 within-year) and ~1.3% (2023 vs 2024 cross-year). The null C% provides the baseline false-positive rate for interpreting these observed rates.

The 99th percentile (1.4504) and 99.9th percentile (2.1998) provide upper bounds on chance-level |Δ_MH| fluctuations.

## Distribution Shape

- Mean |Δ_MH| across all observations: 0.3740
- Median |Δ_MH|: 0.2956
- Std dev: 0.3205
- Skewness: 1.7897
- Max observed: 6.2475

The null distribution is right-skewed with most mass concentrated near zero, consistent with well-behaved random assignment where group differences are due purely to sampling variability.
