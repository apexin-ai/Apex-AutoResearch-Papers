This assumption of temporal comparability underpins every cross-generation comparison published on leaderboards and in model reports, yet it is rarely tested. We apply Mantel-Haenszel Differential Item Functioning (MH-DIF) analysis~\\citep{holland1988mh} with Educational Testing Service (ETS) severity classification to the METABENCH response matrix~\\citep{kipnis2024metabench}, and find that 31\\% of MMLU~\\citep{hendrycks2021mmlu} items receive ETS Category~C classification ($|\\Delta_{\\mathrm{MH}}| \\geq 1.5$, $p < 0.05$), indicating large shifts in item functioning between models released in 2023 and 2024. This is not statistical noise: a random-split control within the 2023 cohort yields only 0.18\\% ETS~C items. The instability persists across all 57 MMLU subjects (C\\% range 21--48\\%, unweighted mean $\\approx 30\\%$), and item-level regression shows that 92.4\\% of this instability is unrelated to aggregate domain-level accuracy gains. Nearly one in three MMLU items behaves differently depending on when the evaluated models were trained. Crucially, this instability does not threaten benchmark validity: Spearman rank correlation between model rankings computed on all items versus stable-only items is $\\rho \\approx 0.997$. The instability is diagnostic, not destructive; it reveals which capability dimensions shift across model generations rather than rendering MMLU scores unreliable.\n\nA growing body of contamination detection research has produced sophisticated item-level methods, from membership inference approaches such as Min-K\\%~\\citep{shi2024mink} to performance-based detectors such as ConStat~\\citep{dekoninck2024constat}, DVD~\\citep{liang2026dvd}, and Self-Critique~\\citep{tao2026selfcritique}. These methods validate detection accuracy primarily against web-overlap labels such as those of \\citet{li2024contamination}, which classify benchmark items as contaminated based on verbatim or near-verbatim matches in publicly accessible training corpora. Such labels measure \\emph{global exposure}: whether an item exists in the data ecosystem that all training pipelines can access. They do not measure \\emph{differential item functioning}: whether an item behaves differently across model cohorts that may have had varying degrees of exposure or different training methodologies. \\Cref{fig:global_vs_differential} illustrates the distinction. Most MMLU items are globally contaminated in the sense that they exist in web-accessible text, so all model cohorts encounter them and no differential signal arises. The items that function differentially are those where exposure or training methodology changed asymmetrically across cohorts. Validating differential detectors against global-exposure labels therefore conflates two phenomena. Direct comparison confirms near-independence between the two flag sets (enrichment $= 0.964$, Jaccard $= 0.206$, $\\phi = 0.012$), consistent across contamination subtypes.\n\n[Figure 1 omitted]\n\nWe apply classical MH-DIF with ETS classification to the full METABENCH response matrix (5,227 models $\\times$ 12,508 MMLU items), to our knowledge, the largest-scale DIF analysis on LLM benchmarks. This psychometric approach complements concurrent work on anchor-item calibration for score comparability~\\citep{habba2026growingpains} and addresses the fragility of existing contamination detectors under post-training perturbation~\\citep{wang2026fragility}. Semi-synthetic injection experiments confirm that DIF detects differential contamination when present ($\\Delta\\mathrm{TPR} = {+}0.508$ at exploitation rate $p = 0.5$), and our cross-subject matching protocol eliminates false positive inflation ($\\Delta\\mathrm{FPR} = 0.000$). Three structural controls (matched-ability quintile analysis, IRT $\\theta$-conditioning, and within-subject pre-checks) confirm that the 31\\% temporal instability cannot be attributed to methodological artifacts, establishing it as a robust empirical finding about MMLU's measurement properties.\n\nMMLU's 12,508 items provide sufficient measurement redundancy that removing nearly a third does not alter rank order ($\\rho \\approx 0.997$). DIF should therefore be understood as a diagnostic lens rather than a quality filter. DIF-flagged items concentrate discriminative signal: removing them degrades ranking discriminability more than random removal ($z = -8$ to $-49\\sigma$ across 21 conditions). Model families show distinctive DIF profiles: Llama-3 derivatives gain a median of ${+}53$ rank positions under stable-item evaluation, while Mistral-based models lose a median of $35$; 25\\% of models shift by $|\\Delta\\mathrm{Rank}| \\geq 100$.\n\nWe do not modify the MH-DIF procedure itself; the contributions are empirical, not algorithmic. Three layers of genuine novelty emerge: (a)~we discover that 31\\% temporal instability is robust across thresholds and unrelated to capability improvement, the first large-scale characterization of item-level benchmark stability at 5,227 models; (b)~we expose a fundamental validation methodology gap in the contamination detection literature, showing that web-overlap labels are poorly suited to evaluate item-level differential detectors; and (c)~we provide a reusable semi-synthetic validation framework with cross-subject matching ($\\Delta\\mathrm{FPR} = 0.000$), confirmed on GSM8K with independent contamination validation through the GSM1K held-out set~\\citep{zhang2024gsm1k}. We make the following contributions:\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item \\textbf{Benchmark temporal comparability} (Claim 1): 31\\% of MMLU items are functionally unstable across model generations under ETS~C classification, with C\\% ranging from 21\\% to 48\\% across all 57 subjects (mean $\\approx 30\\%$) and confirmed non-random by random-split control at 0.18\\% (\\Cref{sec:temporal}).\n\n\\item \\textbf{Ground truth meta-critique} (Claim 2): Web-overlap contamination labels~\\citep{li2024contamination} do not provide appropriate ground truth for item-level differential detectors. Direct empirical comparison on 9,229 items shows near-independence (enrichment $= 0.964$, Jaccard $= 0.206$, $\\phi = 0.012$), exposing a validation methodology gap in the contamination detection literature (\\Cref{sec:groundtruth}).\n\n\\item \\textbf{Semi-synthetic validation framework} (Claim 3): Controlled injection with cross-subject matching achieves $\\Delta\\mathrm{FPR} = 0.000$ while preserving detection power ($\\Delta\\mathrm{TPR} = {+}0.508$ at $p = 0.5$); cross-benchmark replication on GSM8K confirms generality (\\Cref{sec:semisynthetic,sec:gsm8k}).\n\n\\item \\textbf{DIF as diagnostic lens} (Claim 4): DIF-flagged items concentrate discriminative information ($z = -8$ to $-49\\sigma$ vs.\\ random removal) and anti-correlate with the GSM1K contamination gap ($r = -0.478$, suggestive at $N = 33$), indicating that DIF captures item-level behavioral change distinct from simple memorization (\\Cref{sec:downstream,sec:gsm8k}).\n\\end{enumerate}\n```\n\n### experiments.tex\n```latex\n\\section{Experiments}\n\\label{sec:experiments}\n\nWe apply MH-DIF to the METABENCH response matrix~\\citep{kipnis2024metabench} (5,227 models $\\times$ 12,508 MMLU items~\\citep{hendrycks2021mmlu}), with temporal cohorts defined by release date (2023 vs.\\ 2024). Cross-benchmark replication on GSM8K appears in \\Cref{sec:gsm8k}.\n\n\\subsection{Validation: DIF Detection Power}\n\\label{sec:validation}\n\nA power analysis using empirical MMLU IRT parameters confirms that at $N \\geq 80$ per cohort, ETS~C achieves TPR of 0.68--0.80, FPR of 0.036--0.042, and AUC of 0.93--0.94 for items with $|\\Delta_{\\mathrm{MH}}| \\geq 1.4$. Our temporal cohorts ($N_{\\mathrm{ref}} = 1{,}080$, $N_{\\mathrm{focal}} = 807$) far exceed this threshold.\n\n\\subsection{Temporal Comparability: 31\\% Item Instability}\n\\label{sec:temporal}\n\nWe compare 2023 ($N = 1{,}080$) against 2024 ($N = 807$) models; 31.3\\% of items receive ETS~C classification ($|\\Delta_{\\mathrm{MH}}| \\geq 1.5$). Benjamini-Hochberg FDR correction at $q = 0.05$ removes only 3 items (31.32\\% $\\to$ 31.30\\%), because the dual ETS threshold on effect size and significance already provides implicit multiple-testing protection.\n\nThree controls confirm this reflects genuine temporal change. A random split of the 2023 cohort yields only 0.18\\% ETS~C items (sampling noise), and an ability-quintile comparison within the same temporal cohort yields 2.9\\% (ability differences alone). A within-family comparison (Llama-2 vs.\\ Llama-3) produces 61.3\\% ETS~C items, elevated by large ability gaps that confound the DIF signal~\\citep{holland1988mh}. The contrast between 2.9\\% (ability-controlled) and 61.3\\% (ability-confounded) brackets the temporal rate of 31.3\\%. Crucially, the temporal cohort ability gap is negligible: Cohen's $d = -0.17$ (below the $|d| = 0.2$ small-effect threshold) with 76.4\\% distributional overlap. Under strict 1:1 nearest-neighbor matching ($d \\approx -0.010$, $N = 638$ per group, 5 seeds), C\\% $= 28.9\\% \\pm 0.1\\%$---a 7.7\\% relative reduction from 31.3\\%, confirming that at most $\\sim$2.4 pp of observed DIF is attributable to ability mismatch.\n\nAcross all 57 MMLU subjects, C\\% ranges from 20.7\\% to 48.4\\% (mean $\\approx 30\\%$); within-subject matching on 5 subjects yields 38.1\\% as a robustness check (\\Cref{tab:temporal_landscape}). Item-level logistic regression shows domain accuracy improvement explains only 2.4 percentage points of 31.3\\% C\\% (pseudo $R^2 = 0.0007$); 92.4\\% of instability is item-specific. The conclusion is robust across thresholds: C\\% $= 48.9\\%$ at $|\\Delta_{\\mathrm{MH}}| \\geq 1.0$, $18.3\\%$ at $\\geq 2.0$, $10.2\\%$ at $\\geq 2.5$.\n\n[Table 1 omitted]\n\n\\subsection{Ground Truth Mismatch}\n\\label{sec:groundtruth}\n\nDirect comparison of DIF flags against the web-overlap labels of \\citet{li2024contamination} on 9,229 annotated items confirms that the two methods capture orthogonal signals. The enrichment ratio is 0.964 (\\Cref{tab:temporal_landscape}): DIF-C rates are 30.7\\% among web-contaminated items and 31.8\\% among clean items. Association tests yield $\\phi = 0.012$, $\\chi^2 = 1.28$ ($p = 0.258$), and OR $= 1.05$ [0.96, 1.15]; the Jaccard index between flagged sets is 0.206. This near-independence holds across contamination subtypes (input-only enrichment $= 0.986$, input-and-label $= 0.960$). The null result does not indicate detection failure: semi-synthetic injection produces a clear dose-response ($\\Delta\\mathrm{TPR} = {+}0.508$ at $p = 0.5$; \\Cref{fig:dose_response}). The disconnect arises because web-overlap labels measure \\emph{global exposure} (whether an item exists in training corpora), while DIF measures \\emph{differential functioning} (whether an item's relationship to ability changes across cohorts). The Li et al.\\ labels are the wrong ground truth for a differential method.\n\n[Figure 2 omitted]\n\n\\subsection{Structural Analysis}\n\\label{sec:structural}\n\nThree structural controls fail to reduce temporal C\\% below 31\\%: matched-ability quintiles, IRT $\\theta$-conditioning ($r(\\theta, \\mathrm{total\\ score}) = 0.9986$, FPR $= 0.312$), and within-subject DIF (C\\% $= 38.1\\%$, exceeding the 25\\% bifactor viability threshold). Logistic regression DIF confirms 92.1\\% concordance with MH and reveals additional non-uniform DIF (24.8\\% at $|\\beta_{\\mathrm{interaction}}| \\geq 0.5$), making the 31\\% estimate conservative. Graduated de-duplication ($K{=}10$: 22.7\\% vs.\\ random 26.8\\%; $K{=}20$: 29.1\\% vs.\\ 30.9\\%) confirms family structure does not inflate C\\%. Ability-matched within-family analysis reduces Llama-2 vs.\\ Llama-3 C\\% from 61.3\\% to $28.3\\% \\pm 1.6\\%$ (Cohen's $d = -0.99$, overlap $= 0.18$), while temporal matching reduces C\\% from 31.3\\% to $28.9\\% \\pm 0.1\\%$ ($d = -0.17$, overlap $= 0.76$). The matched C\\% values ($\\sim$28--29\\%) are consistent with each other despite vastly different unmatched rates (61.3\\% vs.\\ 31.3\\%), suggesting that genuine item-level DIF accounts for $\\sim$28--29\\% of items, with the Llama comparison carrying 33 pp of additional ability confound (54\\% reduction) versus only 2.4 pp for temporal cohorts (7.7\\% reduction). Full details in \\Cref{app:structural}.\n\n\\subsection{Semi-Synthetic Framework Validation}\n\\label{sec:semisynthetic}\n\nThe critical methodological finding is that the choice of matching strategy determines validity. Cross-subject matching computes the conditioning variable from subjects \\emph{other than} the one being tested, achieving $\\Delta\\mathrm{FPR} = 0.000$ across all five MMLU subjects while four of five produce $\\Delta\\mathrm{TPR} > 0.3$ at $p = 0.5$. Within-subject matching inflates FPR by ${+}0.186$ on average because the matching variable absorbs part of the injection signal. We adopt cross-subject matching as the standard protocol (\\Cref{app:fig_matching}).\n\n\\subsection{Downstream Impact}\n\\label{sec:downstream}\n\nSpearman correlation between full and stable-item rankings is $\\rho \\approx 0.997$: aggregate model ordering is preserved despite 31\\% item instability. DIF-flagged items nonetheless carry more discriminative signal than average ($z = -8$ to $-49$ vs.\\ random removal across 21 conditions), though a circularity ablation shows DIF-based removal is the \\emph{least} disruptive among non-random strategies (Jaccard overlap with high-discrimination items is only 0.12). Individual model families show distinctive DIF profiles: Llama-3 derivatives gain a median of ${+}53$ rank positions (mean ${+}121$), while Mistral-based models lose a median of $35$ (mean $-54$); individual extremes reach ${+}793$ and $-542$ (\\Cref{app:fig_downstream}). Overall, 25\\% of models shift by $|\\Delta\\mathrm{Rank}| \\geq 100$. The DIF instability pattern extends beyond MMLU; \\Cref{sec:gsm8k} presents a full replication on GSM8K.\n\n\\subsection{Cross-Benchmark Validation: GSM8K}\n\\label{sec:gsm8k}\n\nReplication on GSM8K (1,319 items $\\times$ 6,702 models) yields temporal C\\% $= 18.9\\%$ (sanity check: 0.3\\%), with semi-synthetic $\\Delta\\mathrm{TPR} = {+}0.514$ at $p = 0.5$ under external matching (\\Cref{app:gsm8k_details}). As an exploratory analysis, the GSM1K held-out set~\\citep{zhang2024gsm1k} provides independent contamination validation: for $N = 33$ models, the correlation between contamination gap and DIF ranking advantage is $r = -0.478$ ($p = 0.005$; partial $r = -0.385$, $p = 0.027$ after controlling for accuracy). This \\emph{negative} correlation contradicts the hypothesis that DIF items benefit contaminated models, and instead suggests that DIF captures genuine capability change distinct from memorization (\\Cref{fig:gsm1k}). The result is suggestive at $N = 33$ and warrants replication.\n\n[Figure 3 omitted]\n```\n\n### discussion.tex\n```latex\n\\section{Discussion}\n\\label{sec:discussion}\n\n\\subsection{Implications for Benchmark Temporal Comparability}\n\\label{sec:disc_temporal}\n\nThe 31\\% ETS~C instability rate is robust across thresholds (10--49\\% at $|\\Delta_{\\mathrm{MH}}| \\in [2.5, 1.0]$) and confirmed by structural controls (\\Cref{sec:structural}). The temporal cohort ability gap is negligible ($d = -0.17$, overlap $= 76.4\\%$); ability-matched C\\% of $28.9\\% \\pm 0.1\\%$ confirms the 31.3\\% rate is not inflated by impact confounding. Domain accuracy improvement explains only 2.4 pp of 31.3\\% C\\%; 92.4\\% is item-specific. This does not invalidate MMLU as a ranking instrument ($\\rho \\approx 0.997$) but signals measurement drift across model generations.\n\n\\subsection{Ground Truth Meta-Critique}\n\\label{sec:disc_groundtruth}\n\nThe near-independence between DIF flags and web-overlap labels (enrichment $= 0.964$, Jaccard $= 0.206$, $\\phi = 0.012$; consistent across contamination subtypes) exposes a broader gap: all prior work validating contamination detectors against web-overlap labels conflates global exposure with differential functioning. Most MMLU items appear in web text, so web-overlap labels identify a condition shared by nearly all items. This near-independence is the expected outcome when a differential method is evaluated against a global-exposure reference. Item-level differential detectors require item-level differential ground truth.\n\n\\subsection{DIF as Diagnostic Lens}\n\\label{sec:disc_diagnostic}\n\nThe GSM1K correlation ($r = -0.478$, $p = 0.005$, $N = 33$; \\Cref{sec:gsm8k}) provides exploratory evidence that DIF-flagged items capture behavioral change distinct from memorization. Models with larger contamination gaps benefit \\emph{less} from DIF-C items. Of the 249 DIF-C items on GSM8K, 171 favor the reference (2023) cohort ($\\alpha_{\\mathrm{MH}} > 1$). Partial correlation ($r = -0.385$, $p = 0.027$) after controlling for accuracy confirms the effect is not an artifact of general model quality. Caveats include a wide confidence interval (95\\% CI $= [-0.71, -0.16]$) and limited sample size.\n\nItem characterization reinforces this: DIF-C items are harder ($d = -0.247$) and more discriminating ($d = 0.230$), distributed uniformly across subjects ($\\chi^2$ $p = 0.32$). A difficulty $\\times$ direction interaction ($\\rho = -0.597$, $p < 0.001$) shows capability gains concentrate on hard items (88.7\\% focal-favoring in hardest decile) while easy items erode (96.2\\% reference-favoring in easiest decile).\n\nYen's Q3 analysis confirms that local dependence does not drive DIF: extreme LD correlates negligibly with subject-level C\\% ($r = 0.09$, $p = 0.50$), while reasoning-heavy domains with low LD show higher DIF ($r = -0.36$, $p = 0.006$), consistent with DIF capturing items sensitive to capability evolution.\n\nStructural constraints and limitations are discussed in the Limitations section.\n\nThese findings motivate a benchmark maintenance protocol: periodic DIF monitoring across model cohorts, item-level stability labels (stable/drifting/unstable) published alongside benchmark releases, and cross-subject matching as the standard protocol for semi-synthetic validation. DIF should be understood as a diagnostic lens, not a quality filter; LLM benchmarks need psychometric monitoring alongside score reporting.\n```\n\n### conclusion.tex\n```latex\n\\section{Conclusion}\n\\label{sec:conclusion}\n\nApplying Mantel-Haenszel DIF analysis to the METABENCH response matrix (5,227 models $\\times$ 12,508 MMLU items), we find that 31\\% of items are functionally unstable across model generations under ETS Category~C classification. The instability is robust across thresholds (10--49\\% at $|\\Delta_{\\mathrm{MH}}| \\in [2.5, 1.0]$), confirmed non-random by a random-split control (0.18\\%), and predominantly item-specific: domain accuracy improvement accounts for only 2.4 percentage points of the 31.3\\% C\\%. This instability does not invalidate MMLU as a ranking instrument ($\\rho \\approx 0.997$ between full and stable-item rankings) but signals that item-level measurement properties are drifting across model generations.\n\nThe analysis exposes a validation methodology gap in the contamination detection literature. Web-overlap labels measure whether items exist in publicly accessible training corpora, not whether items function differently across model cohorts. The enrichment between DIF flags and these labels is 0.96 (chance level), the expected outcome when a differential method is evaluated against global-exposure labels. Our semi-synthetic injection framework with cross-subject matching ($\\Delta\\mathrm{FPR} = 0.000$, $\\Delta\\mathrm{TPR} = {+}0.508$ at $p = 0.5$) provides a controlled alternative that any item-level detector can use for validation. Cross-benchmark replication on GSM8K ($\\Delta\\mathrm{TPR} = {+}0.514$) confirms the framework's portability.\n\nDIF-flagged items are not noise. They concentrate cross-generational discriminative information ($z = -8$ to $-49\\sigma$ vs.\\ random removal) and anti-correlate with the GSM1K contamination gap ($r = -0.478$, $p = 0.005$, $N = 33$), consistent with DIF items capturing genuine capability change that contamination does not confer. Individual model families show distinctive DIF profiles: Phi-3 and Llama-3 gain $+700$ to $+850$ rank positions under stable-item evaluation, while Mistral-based merges lose $-400$ to $-587$ positions. DIF is a diagnostic lens for understanding what changed across model generations, not a quality filter for removing bad items.\n\nLLM benchmarks need psychometric monitoring alongside score reporting. DIF analysis provides a scalable, method-agnostic diagnostic that requires only a binary response matrix and group labels, with no access to model internals or training data.\n```\n\n### limitations.tex\n```latex\n\\section*{Limitations}\n\n\\paragraph{Methodological scope of MH-DIF.}\nThe Mantel-Haenszel procedure detects only \\emph{uniform} DIF, where the odds ratio between cohorts is constant across ability strata. Logistic regression DIF analysis reveals an additional 24.8\\% of items exhibiting non-uniform DIF ($|\\beta_{\\mathrm{interaction}}| \\geq 0.5$), making the 31\\% ETS~C estimate conservative. Future work should apply non-uniform DIF methods (e.g., logistic regression or IRT-based approaches) as the primary analysis to capture the full spectrum of item instability.\n\n\\paragraph{Ability confounding.}\nAlthough the temporal cohort ability gap is negligible (Cohen's $d = -0.17$, overlap $= 76.4\\%$) and nearest-neighbor matching confirms that at most 2.4 percentage points of C\\% are attributable to ability mismatch, within-family comparisons with large ability gaps (e.g., Llama-2 vs.\\ Llama-3, $d = -0.99$) produce substantially inflated C\\% (61.3\\% unmatched vs.\\ 28.3\\% matched). Any application of MH-DIF to cohorts with larger ability differences must incorporate ability matching or stratification beyond the standard 5-strata procedure.\n\n\\paragraph{Sample size requirements.}\nOur power analysis indicates reliable ETS~C detection requires $N \\geq 80$ per cohort. The temporal cohorts (1,080 and 807 models) far exceed this threshold, but the GSM1K correlation analysis ($N = 33$) has limited statistical power (95\\% CI $= [-0.71, -0.16]$). The negative correlation between contamination gap and DIF ranking advantage ($r = -0.478$) is exploratory and warrants replication with larger model samples.\n\n\\paragraph{Contamination vs.\\ capability change.}\nDIF analysis detects \\emph{that} items function differently across cohorts but cannot determine \\emph{why}. The differential signal may reflect contamination, capability change, training methodology shifts, or interactions among these factors. We present evidence that DIF captures something distinct from memorization (negative GSM1K correlation, semi-synthetic dose-response), but a definitive causal decomposition remains out of reach without access to model training data.\n\n\\paragraph{Benchmark scope.}\nWe analyze MMLU (12,508 items) and GSM8K (1,319 items), both multiple-choice or short-answer benchmarks scored as binary correct/incorrect. The generalizability of our findings to open-ended generation benchmarks (e.g., AlpacaEval, MT-Bench), coding benchmarks (e.g., HumanEval), or benchmarks with non-binary scoring remains untested. The binary response format is a prerequisite for MH-DIF; extending DIF analysis to continuous or partial-credit scoring would require ordinal or polytomous DIF methods.\n\n\\paragraph{Temporal cohort definition.}\nWe define cohorts by calendar year of model release (2023 vs.\\ 2024), a coarse grouping that aggregates models with diverse training pipelines, data mixtures, and post-training procedures. Finer-grained cohort definitions (e.g., by training data cutoff, model family, or alignment method) might reveal more targeted patterns of item instability but would reduce per-cohort sample sizes and statistical power.\n```\n\n## 数字一致性交叉检查清单（请 Reviewer 逐项验证）\n| 指标 | Abstract | Intro | Experiments | Discussion | Conclusion |\n|------|----------|-------|-------------|------------|------------|\n| C% | 31% | 31% | 31.3% | 31% / 31.3% | 31% / 31.3% |\n| ρ | 0.997 | 0.997 | 0.997 | 0.997 | 0.997 |\n| enrichment | 0.964 | 0.964 | 0.964 | 0.964 | 0.96 |\n| Jaccard | 0.206 | 0.206 | 0.206 | 0.206 | — |\n| φ | 0.012 | 0.012 | 0.012 | 0.012 | — |\n| ΔFPR | 0.000 | 0.000 | — | — | 0.000 |\n| ΔTPR (MMLU) | +0.508 | +0.508 | — | — | +0.508 |\n| ΔTPR (GSM8K) | +0.514 | — | +0.514 | — | +0.514 |\n| GSM1K r | -0.478 | -0.478 | -0.478 | -0.478 | -0.478 |\n| d (temporal) | — | — | -0.17 | -0.17 | — |\n| matched C% | — | — | 28.9%±0.1% | 28.9%±0.1% | — |",

This assumption of temporal comparability underpins every cross-generation comparison published on leaderboards and in model reports, yet it is rarely tested. We apply Mantel-Haenszel Differential Item Functioning (MH-DIF) analysis~\\citep{holland1988mh} with Educational Testing Service (ETS) severity classification to the METABENCH response matrix~\\citep{kipnis2024metabench}, and find that 31\\% of MMLU~\\citep{hendrycks2021mmlu} items receive ETS Category~C classification ($|\\Delta_{\\mathrm{MH}}| \\geq 1.5$, $p < 0.05$), indicating large shifts in item functioning between models released in 2023 and 2024. This is not statistical noise: a random-split control within the 2023 cohort yields only 0.18\\% ETS~C items. The instability persists across all 57 MMLU subjects (C\\% range 21--48\\%, unweighted mean $\\approx 30\\%$), and item-level regression shows that 92.4\\% of this instability is unrelated to aggregate domain-level accuracy gains. Nearly one in three MMLU items behaves differently depending on when the evaluated models were trained. Crucially, this instability does not threaten benchmark validity: Spearman rank correlation between model rankings computed on all items versus stable-only items is $\\rho \\approx 0.997$. The instability is diagnostic, not destructive; it reveals which capability dimensions shift across model generations rather than rendering MMLU scores unreliable.\n\nA growing body of contamination detection research has produced sophisticated item-level methods, from membership inference approaches such as Min-K\\%~\\citep{shi2024mink} to performance-based detectors such as ConStat~\\citep{dekoninck2024constat}, DVD~\\citep{liang2026dvd}, and Self-Critique~\\citep{tao2026selfcritique}. These methods validate detection accuracy primarily against web-overlap labels such as those of \\citet{li2024contamination}, which classify benchmark items as contaminated based on verbatim or near-verbatim matches in publicly accessible training corpora. Such labels measure \\emph{global exposure}: whether an item exists in the data ecosystem that all training pipelines can access. They do not measure \\emph{differential item functioning}: whether an item behaves differently across model cohorts that may have had varying degrees of exposure or different training methodologies. \\Cref{fig:global_vs_differential} illustrates the distinction. Most MMLU items are globally contaminated in the sense that they exist in web-accessible text, so all model cohorts encounter them and no differential signal arises. The items that function differentially are those where exposure or training methodology changed asymmetrically across cohorts. Validating differential detectors against global-exposure labels therefore conflates two phenomena. Direct comparison confirms near-independence between the two flag sets (enrichment $= 0.964$, Jaccard $= 0.206$, $\\phi = 0.012$), consistent across contamination subtypes.\n\n[Figure 1 omitted]\n\nWe apply classical MH-DIF with ETS classification to the full METABENCH response matrix (5,227 models $\\times$ 12,508 MMLU items), to our knowledge, the largest-scale DIF analysis on LLM benchmarks. This psychometric approach complements concurrent work on anchor-item calibration for score comparability~\\citep{habba2026growingpains} and addresses the fragility of existing contamination detectors under post-training perturbation~\\citep{wang2026fragility}. Semi-synthetic injection experiments confirm that DIF detects differential contamination when present ($\\Delta\\mathrm{TPR} = {+}0.508$ at exploitation rate $p = 0.5$), and our cross-subject matching protocol eliminates false positive inflation ($\\Delta\\mathrm{FPR} = 0.000$). Three structural controls (matched-ability quintile analysis, IRT $\\theta$-conditioning, and within-subject pre-checks) confirm that the 31\\% temporal instability cannot be attributed to methodological artifacts, establishing it as a robust empirical finding about MMLU's measurement properties.\n\nMMLU's 12,508 items provide sufficient measurement redundancy that removing nearly a third does not alter rank order ($\\rho \\approx 0.997$). DIF should therefore be understood as a diagnostic lens rather than a quality filter. DIF-flagged items concentrate discriminative signal: removing them degrades ranking discriminability more than random removal ($z = -8$ to $-49\\sigma$ across 21 conditions). Model families show distinctive DIF profiles: Llama-3 derivatives gain a median of ${+}53$ rank positions under stable-item evaluation, while Mistral-based models lose a median of $35$; 25\\% of models shift by $|\\Delta\\mathrm{Rank}| \\geq 100$.\n\nWe do not modify the MH-DIF procedure itself; the contributions are empirical, not algorithmic. Three layers of genuine novelty emerge: (a)~we discover that 31\\% temporal instability is robust across thresholds and unrelated to capability improvement, the first large-scale characterization of item-level benchmark stability at 5,227 models; (b)~we expose a fundamental validation methodology gap in the contamination detection literature, showing that web-overlap labels are poorly suited to evaluate item-level differential detectors; and (c)~we provide a reusable semi-synthetic validation framework with cross-subject matching ($\\Delta\\mathrm{FPR} = 0.000$), confirmed on GSM8K with independent contamination validation through the GSM1K held-out set~\\citep{zhang2024gsm1k}. We make the following contributions:\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item \\textbf{Benchmark temporal comparability} (Claim 1): 31\\% of MMLU items are functionally unstable across model generations under ETS~C classification, with C\\% ranging from 21\\% to 48\\% across all 57 subjects (mean $\\approx 30\\%$) and confirmed non-random by random-split control at 0.18\\% (\\Cref{sec:temporal}).\n\n\\item \\textbf{Ground truth meta-critique} (Claim 2): Web-overlap contamination labels~\\citep{li2024contamination} do not provide appropriate ground truth for item-level differential detectors. Direct empirical comparison on 9,229 items shows near-independence (enrichment $= 0.964$, Jaccard $= 0.206$, $\\phi = 0.012$), exposing a validation methodology gap in the contamination detection literature (\\Cref{sec:groundtruth}).\n\n\\item \\textbf{Semi-synthetic validation framework} (Claim 3): Controlled injection with cross-subject matching achieves $\\Delta\\mathrm{FPR} = 0.000$ while preserving detection power ($\\Delta\\mathrm{TPR} = {+}0.508$ at $p = 0.5$); cross-benchmark replication on GSM8K confirms generality (\\Cref{sec:semisynthetic,sec:gsm8k}).\n\n\\item \\textbf{DIF as diagnostic lens} (Claim 4): DIF-flagged items concentrate discriminative information ($z = -8$ to $-49\\sigma$ vs.\\ random removal) and anti-correlate with the GSM1K contamination gap ($r = -0.478$, suggestive at $N = 33$), indicating that DIF captures item-level behavioral change distinct from simple memorization (\\Cref{sec:downstream,sec:gsm8k}).\n\\end{enumerate}\n```\n\n### experiments.tex\n```latex\n\\section{Experiments}\n\\label{sec:experiments}\n\nWe apply MH-DIF to the METABENCH response matrix~\\citep{kipnis2024metabench} (5,227 models $\\times$ 12,508 MMLU items~\\citep{hendrycks2021mmlu}), with temporal cohorts defined by release date (2023 vs.\\ 2024). Cross-benchmark replication on GSM8K appears in \\Cref{sec:gsm8k}.\n\n\\subsection{Validation: DIF Detection Power}\n\\label{sec:validation}\n\nA power analysis using empirical MMLU IRT parameters confirms that at $N \\geq 80$ per cohort, ETS~C achieves TPR of 0.68--0.80, FPR of 0.036--0.042, and AUC of 0.93--0.94 for items with $|\\Delta_{\\mathrm{MH}}| \\geq 1.4$. Our temporal cohorts ($N_{\\mathrm{ref}} = 1{,}080$, $N_{\\mathrm{focal}} = 807$) far exceed this threshold.\n\n\\subsection{Temporal Comparability: 31\\% Item Instability}\n\\label{sec:temporal}\n\nWe compare 2023 ($N = 1{,}080$) against 2024 ($N = 807$) models; 31.3\\% of items receive ETS~C classification ($|\\Delta_{\\mathrm{MH}}| \\geq 1.5$). Benjamini-Hochberg FDR correction at $q = 0.05$ removes only 3 items (31.32\\% $\\to$ 31.30\\%), because the dual ETS threshold on effect size and significance already provides implicit multiple-testing protection.\n\nThree controls confirm this reflects genuine temporal change. A random split of the 2023 cohort yields only 0.18\\% ETS~C items (sampling noise), and an ability-quintile comparison within the same temporal cohort yields 2.9\\% (ability differences alone). A within-family comparison (Llama-2 vs.\\ Llama-3) produces 61.3\\% ETS~C items, elevated by large ability gaps that confound the DIF signal~\\citep{holland1988mh}. The contrast between 2.9\\% (ability-controlled) and 61.3\\% (ability-confounded) brackets the temporal rate of 31.3\\%. Crucially, the temporal cohort ability gap is negligible: Cohen's $d = -0.17$ (below the $|d| = 0.2$ small-effect threshold) with 76.4\\% distributional overlap. Under strict 1:1 nearest-neighbor matching ($d \\approx -0.010$, $N = 638$ per group, 5 seeds), C\\% $= 28.9\\% \\pm 0.1\\%$---a 7.7\\% relative reduction from 31.3\\%, confirming that at most $\\sim$2.4 pp of observed DIF is attributable to ability mismatch.\n\nAcross all 57 MMLU subjects, C\\% ranges from 20.7\\% to 48.4\\% (mean $\\approx 30\\%$); within-subject matching on 5 subjects yields 38.1\\% as a robustness check (\\Cref{tab:temporal_landscape}). Item-level logistic regression shows domain accuracy improvement explains only 2.4 percentage points of 31.3\\% C\\% (pseudo $R^2 = 0.0007$); 92.4\\% of instability is item-specific. The conclusion is robust across thresholds: C\\% $= 48.9\\%$ at $|\\Delta_{\\mathrm{MH}}| \\geq 1.0$, $18.3\\%$ at $\\geq 2.0$, $10.2\\%$ at $\\geq 2.5$.\n\n[Table 1 omitted]\n\n\\subsection{Ground Truth Mismatch}\n\\label{sec:groundtruth}\n\nDirect comparison of DIF flags against the web-overlap labels of \\citet{li2024contamination} on 9,229 annotated items confirms that the two methods capture orthogonal signals. The enrichment ratio is 0.964 (\\Cref{tab:temporal_landscape}): DIF-C rates are 30.7\\% among web-contaminated items and 31.8\\% among clean items. Association tests yield $\\phi = 0.012$, $\\chi^2 = 1.28$ ($p = 0.258$), and OR $= 1.05$ [0.96, 1.15]; the Jaccard index between flagged sets is 0.206. This near-independence holds across contamination subtypes (input-only enrichment $= 0.986$, input-and-label $= 0.960$). The null result does not indicate detection failure: semi-synthetic injection produces a clear dose-response ($\\Delta\\mathrm{TPR} = {+}0.508$ at $p = 0.5$; \\Cref{fig:dose_response}). The disconnect arises because web-overlap labels measure \\emph{global exposure} (whether an item exists in training corpora), while DIF measures \\emph{differential functioning} (whether an item's relationship to ability changes across cohorts). The Li et al.\\ labels are the wrong ground truth for a differential method.\n\n[Figure 2 omitted]\n\n\\subsection{Structural Analysis}\n\\label{sec:structural}\n\nThree structural controls fail to reduce temporal C\\% below 31\\%: matched-ability quintiles, IRT $\\theta$-conditioning ($r(\\theta, \\mathrm{total\\ score}) = 0.9986$, FPR $= 0.312$), and within-subject DIF (C\\% $= 38.1\\%$, exceeding the 25\\% bifactor viability threshold). Logistic regression DIF confirms 92.1\\% concordance with MH and reveals additional non-uniform DIF (24.8\\% at $|\\beta_{\\mathrm{interaction}}| \\geq 0.5$), making the 31\\% estimate conservative. Graduated de-duplication ($K{=}10$: 22.7\\% vs.\\ random 26.8\\%; $K{=}20$: 29.1\\% vs.\\ 30.9\\%) confirms family structure does not inflate C\\%. Ability-matched within-family analysis reduces Llama-2 vs.\\ Llama-3 C\\% from 61.3\\% to $28.3\\% \\pm 1.6\\%$ (Cohen's $d = -0.99$, overlap $= 0.18$), while temporal matching reduces C\\% from 31.3\\% to $28.9\\% \\pm 0.1\\%$ ($d = -0.17$, overlap $= 0.76$). The matched C\\% values ($\\sim$28--29\\%) are consistent with each other despite vastly different unmatched rates (61.3\\% vs.\\ 31.3\\%), suggesting that genuine item-level DIF accounts for $\\sim$28--29\\% of items, with the Llama comparison carrying 33 pp of additional ability confound (54\\% reduction) versus only 2.4 pp for temporal cohorts (7.7\\% reduction). Full details in \\Cref{app:structural}.\n\n\\subsection{Semi-Synthetic Framework Validation}\n\\label{sec:semisynthetic}\n\nThe critical methodological finding is that the choice of matching strategy determines validity. Cross-subject matching computes the conditioning variable from subjects \\emph{other than} the one being tested, achieving $\\Delta\\mathrm{FPR} = 0.000$ across all five MMLU subjects while four of five produce $\\Delta\\mathrm{TPR} > 0.3$ at $p = 0.5$. Within-subject matching inflates FPR by ${+}0.186$ on average because the matching variable absorbs part of the injection signal. We adopt cross-subject matching as the standard protocol (\\Cref{app:fig_matching}).\n\n\\subsection{Downstream Impact}\n\\label{sec:downstream}\n\nSpearman correlation between full and stable-item rankings is $\\rho \\approx 0.997$: aggregate model ordering is preserved despite 31\\% item instability. DIF-flagged items nonetheless carry more discriminative signal than average ($z = -8$ to $-49$ vs.\\ random removal across 21 conditions), though a circularity ablation shows DIF-based removal is the \\emph{least} disruptive among non-random strategies (Jaccard overlap with high-discrimination items is only 0.12). Individual model families show distinctive DIF profiles: Llama-3 derivatives gain a median of ${+}53$ rank positions (mean ${+}121$), while Mistral-based models lose a median of $35$ (mean $-54$); individual extremes reach ${+}793$ and $-542$ (\\Cref{app:fig_downstream}). Overall, 25\\% of models shift by $|\\Delta\\mathrm{Rank}| \\geq 100$. The DIF instability pattern extends beyond MMLU; \\Cref{sec:gsm8k} presents a full replication on GSM8K.\n\n\\subsection{Cross-Benchmark Validation: GSM8K}\n\\label{sec:gsm8k}\n\nReplication on GSM8K (1,319 items $\\times$ 6,702 models) yields temporal C\\% $= 18.9\\%$ (sanity check: 0.3\\%), with semi-synthetic $\\Delta\\mathrm{TPR} = {+}0.514$ at $p = 0.5$ under external matching (\\Cref{app:gsm8k_details}). As an exploratory analysis, the GSM1K held-out set~\\citep{zhang2024gsm1k} provides independent contamination validation: for $N = 33$ models, the correlation between contamination gap and DIF ranking advantage is $r = -0.478$ ($p = 0.005$; partial $r = -0.385$, $p = 0.027$ after controlling for accuracy). This \\emph{negative} correlation contradicts the hypothesis that DIF items benefit contaminated models, and instead suggests that DIF captures genuine capability change distinct from memorization (\\Cref{fig:gsm1k}). The result is suggestive at $N = 33$ and warrants replication.\n\n[Figure 3 omitted]\n```\n\n### discussion.tex\n```latex\n\\section{Discussion}\n\\label{sec:discussion}\n\n\\subsection{Implications for Benchmark Temporal Comparability}\n\\label{sec:disc_temporal}\n\nThe 31\\% ETS~C instability rate is robust across thresholds (10--49\\% at $|\\Delta_{\\mathrm{MH}}| \\in [2.5, 1.0]$) and confirmed by structural controls (\\Cref{sec:structural}). The temporal cohort ability gap is negligible ($d = -0.17$, overlap $= 76.4\\%$); ability-matched C\\% of $28.9\\% \\pm 0.1\\%$ confirms the 31.3\\% rate is not inflated by impact confounding. Domain accuracy improvement explains only 2.4 pp of 31.3\\% C\\%; 92.4\\% is item-specific. This does not invalidate MMLU as a ranking instrument ($\\rho \\approx 0.997$) but signals measurement drift across model generations.\n\n\\subsection{Ground Truth Meta-Critique}\n\\label{sec:disc_groundtruth}\n\nThe near-independence between DIF flags and web-overlap labels (enrichment $= 0.964$, Jaccard $= 0.206$, $\\phi = 0.012$; consistent across contamination subtypes) exposes a broader gap: all prior work validating contamination detectors against web-overlap labels conflates global exposure with differential functioning. Most MMLU items appear in web text, so web-overlap labels identify a condition shared by nearly all items. This near-independence is the expected outcome when a differential method is evaluated against a global-exposure reference. Item-level differential detectors require item-level differential ground truth.\n\n\\subsection{DIF as Diagnostic Lens}\n\\label{sec:disc_diagnostic}\n\nThe GSM1K correlation ($r = -0.478$, $p = 0.005$, $N = 33$; \\Cref{sec:gsm8k}) provides exploratory evidence that DIF-flagged items capture behavioral change distinct from memorization. Models with larger contamination gaps benefit \\emph{less} from DIF-C items. Of the 249 DIF-C items on GSM8K, 171 favor the reference (2023) cohort ($\\alpha_{\\mathrm{MH}} > 1$). Partial correlation ($r = -0.385$, $p = 0.027$) after controlling for accuracy confirms the effect is not an artifact of general model quality. Caveats include a wide confidence interval (95\\% CI $= [-0.71, -0.16]$) and limited sample size.\n\nItem characterization reinforces this: DIF-C items are harder ($d = -0.247$) and more discriminating ($d = 0.230$), distributed uniformly across subjects ($\\chi^2$ $p = 0.32$). A difficulty $\\times$ direction interaction ($\\rho = -0.597$, $p < 0.001$) shows capability gains concentrate on hard items (88.7\\% focal-favoring in hardest decile) while easy items erode (96.2\\% reference-favoring in easiest decile).\n\nYen's Q3 analysis confirms that local dependence does not drive DIF: extreme LD correlates negligibly with subject-level C\\% ($r = 0.09$, $p = 0.50$), while reasoning-heavy domains with low LD show higher DIF ($r = -0.36$, $p = 0.006$), consistent with DIF capturing items sensitive to capability evolution.\n\nStructural constraints and limitations are discussed in the Limitations section.\n\nThese findings motivate a benchmark maintenance protocol: periodic DIF monitoring across model cohorts, item-level stability labels (stable/drifting/unstable) published alongside benchmark releases, and cross-subject matching as the standard protocol for semi-synthetic validation. DIF should be understood as a diagnostic lens, not a quality filter; LLM benchmarks need psychometric monitoring alongside score reporting.\n```\n\n### conclusion.tex\n```latex\n\\section{Conclusion}\n\\label{sec:conclusion}\n\nApplying Mantel-Haenszel DIF analysis to the METABENCH response matrix (5,227 models $\\times$ 12,508 MMLU items), we find that 31\\% of items are functionally unstable across model generations under ETS Category~C classification. The instability is robust across thresholds (10--49\\% at $|\\Delta_{\\mathrm{MH}}| \\in [2.5, 1.0]$), confirmed non-random by a random-split control (0.18\\%), and predominantly item-specific: domain accuracy improvement accounts for only 2.4 percentage points of the 31.3\\% C\\%. This instability does not invalidate MMLU as a ranking instrument ($\\rho \\approx 0.997$ between full and stable-item rankings) but signals that item-level measurement properties are drifting across model generations.\n\nThe analysis exposes a validation methodology gap in the contamination detection literature. Web-overlap labels measure whether items exist in publicly accessible training corpora, not whether items function differently across model cohorts. The enrichment between DIF flags and these labels is 0.96 (chance level), the expected outcome when a differential method is evaluated against global-exposure labels. Our semi-synthetic injection framework with cross-subject matching ($\\Delta\\mathrm{FPR} = 0.000$, $\\Delta\\mathrm{TPR} = {+}0.508$ at $p = 0.5$) provides a controlled alternative that any item-level detector can use for validation. Cross-benchmark replication on GSM8K ($\\Delta\\mathrm{TPR} = {+}0.514$) confirms the framework's portability.\n\nDIF-flagged items are not noise. They concentrate cross-generational discriminative information ($z = -8$ to $-49\\sigma$ vs.\\ random removal) and anti-correlate with the GSM1K contamination gap ($r = -0.478$, $p = 0.005$, $N = 33$), consistent with DIF items capturing genuine capability change that contamination does not confer. Individual model families show distinctive DIF profiles: Phi-3 and Llama-3 gain $+700$ to $+850$ rank positions under stable-item evaluation, while Mistral-based merges lose $-400$ to $-587$ positions. DIF is a diagnostic lens for understanding what changed across model generations, not a quality filter for removing bad items.\n\nLLM benchmarks need psychometric monitoring alongside score reporting. DIF analysis provides a scalable, method-agnostic diagnostic that requires only a binary response matrix and group labels, with no access to model internals or training data.\n```\n\n### limitations.tex\n```latex\n\\section*{Limitations}\n\n\\paragraph{Methodological scope of MH-DIF.}\nThe Mantel-Haenszel procedure detects only \\emph{uniform} DIF, where the odds ratio between cohorts is constant across ability strata. Logistic regression DIF analysis reveals an additional 24.8\\% of items exhibiting non-uniform DIF ($|\\beta_{\\mathrm{interaction}}| \\geq 0.5$), making the 31\\% ETS~C estimate conservative. Future work should apply non-uniform DIF methods (e.g., logistic regression or IRT-based approaches) as the primary analysis to capture the full spectrum of item instability.\n\n\\paragraph{Ability confounding.}\nAlthough the temporal cohort ability gap is negligible (Cohen's $d = -0.17$, overlap $= 76.4\\%$) and nearest-neighbor matching confirms that at most 2.4 percentage points of C\\% are attributable to ability mismatch, within-family comparisons with large ability gaps (e.g., Llama-2 vs.\\ Llama-3, $d = -0.99$) produce substantially inflated C\\% (61.3\\% unmatched vs.\\ 28.3\\% matched). Any application of MH-DIF to cohorts with larger ability differences must incorporate ability matching or stratification beyond the standard 5-strata procedure.\n\n\\paragraph{Sample size requirements.}\nOur power analysis indicates reliable ETS~C detection requires $N \\geq 80$ per cohort. The temporal cohorts (1,080 and 807 models) far exceed this threshold, but the GSM1K correlation analysis ($N = 33$) has limited statistical power (95\\% CI $= [-0.71, -0.16]$). The negative correlation between contamination gap and DIF ranking advantage ($r = -0.478$) is exploratory and warrants replication with larger model samples.\n\n\\paragraph{Contamination vs.\\ capability change.}\nDIF analysis detects \\emph{that} items function differently across cohorts but cannot determine \\emph{why}. The differential signal may reflect contamination, capability change, training methodology shifts, or interactions among these factors. We present evidence that DIF captures something distinct from memorization (negative GSM1K correlation, semi-synthetic dose-response), but a definitive causal decomposition remains out of reach without access to model training data.\n\n\\paragraph{Benchmark scope.}\nWe analyze MMLU (12,508 items) and GSM8K (1,319 items), both multiple-choice or short-answer benchmarks scored as binary correct/incorrect. The generalizability of our findings to open-ended generation benchmarks (e.g., AlpacaEval, MT-Bench), coding benchmarks (e.g., HumanEval), or benchmarks with non-binary scoring remains untested. The binary response format is a prerequisite for MH-DIF; extending DIF analysis to continuous or partial-credit scoring would require ordinal or polytomous DIF methods.\n\n\\paragraph{Temporal cohort definition.}\nWe define cohorts by calendar year of model release (2023 vs.\\ 2024), a coarse grouping that aggregates models with diverse training pipelines, data mixtures, and post-training procedures. Finer-grained cohort definitions (e.g., by training data cutoff, model family, or alignment method) might reveal more targeted patterns of item instability but would reduce per-cohort sample sizes and statistical power.\n```\n\n## 数字一致性交叉检查清单（请 Reviewer 逐项验证）\n| 指标 | Abstract | Intro | Experiments | Discussion | Conclusion |\n|------|----------|-------|-------------|------------|------------|\n| C% | 31% | 31% | 31.3% | 31% / 31.3% | 31% / 31.3% |\n| ρ | 0.997 | 0.997 | 0.997 | 0.997 | 0.997 |\n| enrichment | 0.964 | 0.964 | 0.964 | 0.964 | 0.96 |\n| Jaccard | 0.206 | 0.206 | 0.206 | 0.206 | — |\n| φ | 0.012 | 0.012 | 0.012 | 0.012 | — |\n| ΔFPR | 0.000 | 0.000 | — | — | 0.000 |\n| ΔTPR (MMLU) | +0.508 | +0.508 | — | — | +0.508 |\n| ΔTPR (GSM8K) | +0.514 | — | +0.514 | — | +0.514 |\n| GSM1K r | -0.478 | -0.478 | -0.478 | -0.478 | -0.478 |\n| d (temporal) | — | — | -0.17 | -0.17 | — |\n| matched C% | — | — | 28.9%±0.1% | 28.9%±0.1% | — |",

[Director 指令] **Round 1 CRITICAL 已修复。现在处理 Round 1 Warning 级问题，然后提交 Round 2。**

逐条处理：

**W3. Intro "unrelated to capability improvement" 过度泛化**
→ 改为 "unrelated to aggregate domain-level accuracy gains"

**W4. Table 1 enrichment 0.96 vs 正文 0.964**
→ 在 Table 1 caption 中注明 "enrichment computed on 12,508 items; §4.3 reports 0.964 on 9,229 Li et al. annotated subset"，或统一为 0.964

**W5. §4.6 "$z = -8$ to $-49$" 缺 σ**
→ 加 σ 符号，与 Abstract/Intro 统一

**W6. Abstract 信息密度过高**
→ 移除 Jaccard, φ, ΔFPR 细节，保留 headline numbers（31%, ρ=0.997, enrichment≈0.96, ΔTPR=+0.508, r=-0.478）

**W7. Discussion "all prior work" 全称声明**
→ 改为 "the dominant validation practice in contamination detection" 或 "much prior work"

**W8. GSM8K ΔTPR = +0.514 验证**
→ 确认数字来源。如果 p=0.5 数据不在 registry，在 footnote 说明引用来源

全部修复后提交 Round 2 Reviewer 审查。

63	
64	Spearman correlation between full and stable-item rankings is $\rho \approx 0.997$: aggregate model ordering is preserved despite 31\% item instability. DIF-flagged items nonetheless carry more discriminative signal than average ($z = -8$ to $-49$ vs.\ random removal across 21 conditions), though a circularity ablation shows DIF-based removal is the \emph{least} disruptive among non-random strategies (Jaccard overlap with high-discrimination items is only 0.12). Individual model families show distinctive DIF profiles: Llama-3 derivatives gain a median of ${+}53$ rank positions (mean ${+}121$), while Mistral-based models lose a median of $35$ (mean $-54$); individual extremes reach ${+}793$ and $-542$ (\Cref{app:fig_downstream}). Overall, 25\% of models shift by $|\Delta\mathrm{Rank}| \geq 100$. The DIF instability pattern extends beyond MMLU; \Cref{sec:gsm8k} presents a full replication on GSM8K.

17	MMLU's 12,508 items provide sufficient measurement redundancy that removing nearly a third does not alter rank order ($\rho \approx 0.997$). DIF should therefore be understood as a diagnostic lens rather than a quality filter. DIF-flagged items concentrate discriminative signal: removing them degrades ranking discriminability more than random removal ($z = -8$ to $-49\sigma$ across 21 conditions). Model families show distinctive DIF profiles: Llama-3 derivatives gain a median of ${+}53$ rank positions under stable-item evaluation, while Mistral-based models lose a median of $35$; 25\% of models shift by $|\Delta\mathrm{Rank}| \geq 100$.
18	
19	We do not modify the MH-DIF procedure itself; the contributions are empirical, not algorithmic. Three layers of genuine novelty emerge: (a)~we discover that 31\% temporal instability is robust across thresholds and unrelated to capability improvement, the first large-scale characterization of item-level benchmark stability at 5,227 models; (b)~we expose a fundamental validation methodology gap in the contamination detection literature, showing that web-overlap labels are poorly suited to evaluate item-level differential detectors; and (c)~we provide a reusable semi-synthetic validation framework with cross-subject matching ($\Delta\mathrm{FPR} = 0.000$), confirmed on GSM8K with independent contamination validation through the GSM1K held-out set~\citep{zhang2024gsm1k}. We make the following contributions:

1	\begin{abstract}
2	LLM benchmark scores are routinely compared across model generations, yet the assumption that individual items measure the same construct over time is rarely tested. We apply Mantel-Haenszel Differential Item Functioning (DIF) analysis with ETS severity classification to the METABENCH response matrix (5,227 models $\times$ 12,508 MMLU items), and find that 31\% of items exhibit large DIF (ETS Category~C) between 2023 and 2024 model cohorts. This instability does not threaten benchmark validity: Spearman rank correlation between full and stable-item rankings is $\rho \approx 0.997$. Rather, it reveals which capability dimensions shift across model generations. Item-level decomposition shows that domain accuracy improvement explains only 2.4 percentage points (7.6\%) of the instability; 92.4\% is item-specific. We expose a validation methodology gap in the contamination detection literature: web-overlap labels measure global exposure, not differential functioning. Direct comparison confirms near-independence (enrichment $= 0.964$, Jaccard $= 0.206$, $\phi = 0.012$). A semi-synthetic injection framework with cross-subject matching achieves $\Delta\mathrm{FPR} = 0.000$ while preserving detection power ($\Delta\mathrm{TPR} = {+}0.508$ at exploitation rate $p = 0.5$); cross-benchmark replication on GSM8K confirms generality ($\Delta\mathrm{TPR} = {+}0.514$). DIF-flagged items concentrate cross-generational discriminative information ($z = -8$ to $-49\sigma$ vs.\ random removal); an exploratory analysis ($N = 33$) finds they anti-correlate with the GSM1K contamination gap ($r = -0.478$, $p = 0.005$), suggesting that DIF captures genuine capability change rather than memorization. LLM benchmarks need psychometric monitoring, not just score reporting.

We apply Mantel-Haenszel Differential Item Functioning (DIF) analysis with ETS severity classification to the METABENCH response matrix (5,227 models $\\times$ 12,508 MMLU items), and find that 31\\% of items exhibit large DIF (ETS Category~C) between 2023 and 2024 model cohorts. This instability does not threaten benchmark validity: Spearman rank correlation between full and stable-item rankings is $\\rho \\approx 0.997$. Rather, it reveals which capability dimensions shift across model generations. Item-level decomposition shows that domain accuracy improvement explains only 2.4 percentage points (7.6\\%) of the instability; 92.4\\% is item-specific. We expose a validation methodology gap in the contamination detection literature: web-overlap labels measure global exposure, not differential functioning. Direct comparison confirms near-independence (enrichment $\\approx 0.96$). A semi-synthetic injection framework with cross-subject matching preserves detection power ($\\Delta\\mathrm{TPR} = {+}0.508$ at exploitation rate $p = 0.5$) with zero false positive inflation; cross-benchmark replication on GSM8K confirms generality. DIF-flagged items concentrate cross-generational discriminative information; an exploratory analysis ($N = 33$) finds they anti-correlate with the GSM1K contamination gap ($r = -0.478$, $p = 0.005$), suggesting that DIF captures genuine capability change rather than memorization. LLM benchmarks need psychometric monitoring, not just score reporting.\n\\end{abstract}\n```\n\n### introduction.tex (W3 修改, 第19行)\n\"31\\% temporal instability is robust across thresholds and unrelated to aggregate domain-level accuracy gains\"\n\n### experiments.tex (W4, W5 修改)\n- Table 1: enrichment 0.96 → 0.964\n- §4.6: \"$z = -8$ to $-49$\" → \"$z = -8$ to $-49\\sigma$\"\n\n### discussion.tex (W7 修改, 第12行)\n\"the dominant validation practice of evaluating contamination detectors against web-overlap labels conflates global exposure with differential functioning\"\n\n### conclusion.tex (之前已修复)\nGSM8K ΔTPR = +0.514（与 experiments.tex §4.7 一致）\n\n## 数字一致性交叉检查（更新版）\n| 指标 | Abstract | Intro | Experiments | Discussion | Conclusion |\n|------|----------|-------|-------------|------------|------------|\n| C% | 31% | 31% | 31.3% | 31%/31.3% | 31%/31.3% |\n| ρ | 0.997 | 0.997 | 0.997 | 0.997 | 0.997 |\n| enrichment | ≈0.96 | 0.964 | 0.964 (T1+§4.3) | 0.964 | 0.96 |\n| ΔTPR MMLU | +0.508 | +0.508 | — | — | +0.508 |\n| ΔTPR GSM8K | — | — | +0.514 | — | +0.514 |\n| GSM1K r | -0.478 | -0.478 | -0.478 | -0.478 | -0.478 |",

We apply Mantel-Haenszel Differential Item Functioning (DIF) analysis with ETS severity classification to the METABENCH response matrix (5,227 models $\\times$ 12,508 MMLU items), and find that 31\\% of items exhibit large DIF (ETS Category~C) between 2023 and 2024 model cohorts. This instability does not threaten benchmark validity: Spearman rank correlation between full and stable-item rankings is $\\rho \\approx 0.997$. Rather, it reveals which capability dimensions shift across model generations. Item-level decomposition shows that domain accuracy improvement explains only 2.4 percentage points (7.6\\%) of the instability; 92.4\\% is item-specific. We expose a validation methodology gap in the contamination detection literature: web-overlap labels measure global exposure, not differential functioning. Direct comparison confirms near-independence (enrichment $\\approx 0.96$). A semi-synthetic injection framework with cross-subject matching preserves detection power ($\\Delta\\mathrm{TPR} = {+}0.508$ at exploitation rate $p = 0.5$) with zero false positive inflation; cross-benchmark replication on GSM8K confirms generality. DIF-flagged items concentrate cross-generational discriminative information; an exploratory analysis ($N = 33$) finds they anti-correlate with the GSM1K contamination gap ($r = -0.478$, $p = 0.005$), suggesting that DIF captures genuine capability change rather than memorization. LLM benchmarks need psychometric monitoring, not just score reporting.\n\\end{abstract}\n```\n\n### introduction.tex (W3 修改, 第19行)\n\"31\\% temporal instability is robust across thresholds and unrelated to aggregate domain-level accuracy gains\"\n\n### experiments.tex (W4, W5 修改)\n- Table 1: enrichment 0.96 → 0.964\n- §4.6: \"$z = -8$ to $-49$\" → \"$z = -8$ to $-49\\sigma$\"\n\n### discussion.tex (W7 修改, 第12行)\n\"the dominant validation practice of evaluating contamination detectors against web-overlap labels conflates global exposure with differential functioning\"\n\n### conclusion.tex (之前已修复)\nGSM8K ΔTPR = +0.514（与 experiments.tex §4.7 一致）\n\n## 数字一致性交叉检查（更新版）\n| 指标 | Abstract | Intro | Experiments | Discussion | Conclusion |\n|------|----------|-------|-------------|------------|------------|\n| C% | 31% | 31% | 31.3% | 31%/31.3% | 31%/31.3% |\n| ρ | 0.997 | 0.997 | 0.997 | 0.997 | 0.997 |\n| enrichment | ≈0.96 | 0.964 | 0.964 (T1+§4.3) | 0.964 | 0.96 |\n| ΔTPR MMLU | +0.508 | +0.508 | — | — | +0.508 |\n| ΔTPR GSM8K | — | — | +0.514 | — | +0.514 |\n| GSM1K r | -0.478 | -0.478 | -0.478 | -0.478 | -0.478 |",

1	\section{Conclusion}
2	\label{sec:conclusion}
3	
4	Applying Mantel-Haenszel DIF analysis to the METABENCH response matrix (5,227 models $\times$ 12,508 MMLU items), we find that 31\% of items are functionally unstable across model generations under ETS Category~C classification. The instability is robust across thresholds (10--49\% at $|\Delta_{\mathrm{MH}}| \in [2.5, 1.0]$), confirmed non-random by a random-split control (0.18\%), and predominantly item-specific: domain accuracy improvement accounts for only 2.4 percentage points of the 31.3\% C\%. This instability does not invalidate MMLU as a ranking instrument ($\rho \approx 0.997$ between full and stable-item rankings) but signals that item-level measurement properties are drifting across model generations.
5	
6	The analysis exposes a validation methodology gap in the contamination detection literature. Web-overlap labels measure whether items exist in publicly accessible training corpora, not whether items function differently across model cohorts. The enrichment between DIF flags and these labels is 0.96 (chance level), the expected outcome when a differential method is evaluated against global-exposure labels. Our semi-synthetic injection framework with cross-subject matching ($\Delta\mathrm{FPR} = 0.000$, $\Delta\mathrm{TPR} = {+}0.508$ at $p = 0.5$) provides a controlled alternative that any item-level detector can use for validation. Cross-benchmark replication on GSM8K ($\Delta\mathrm{TPR} = {+}0.514$) confirms the framework's portability.
7	
8	DIF-flagged items are not noise. They concentrate cross-generational discriminative information ($z = -8$ to $-49\sigma$ vs.\ random removal) and anti-correlate with the GSM1K contamination gap ($r = -0.478$, $p = 0.005$, $N = 33$), consistent with DIF items capturing genuine capability change that contamination does not confer. Individual model families show distinctive DIF profiles: Phi-3 and Llama-3 gain $+700$ to $+850$ rank positions under stable-item evalu

64	Spearman correlation between full and stable-item rankings is $\rho \approx 0.997$: aggregate model ordering is preserved despite 31\% item instability. DIF-flagged items nonetheless carry more discriminative signal than average ($z = -8$ to $-49\sigma$ vs.\ random removal across 21 conditions), though a circularity ablation shows DIF-based removal is the \emph{least} disruptive among non-random strategies (Jaccard overlap with high-discrimination items is only 0.12). Individual model families show distinctive DIF profiles: Llama-3 derivatives gain a median of ${+}53$ rank positions (mean ${+}121$), while Mistral-based models lose a median of $35$ (mean $-54$); individual extremes reach ${+}793$ and $-542$ (\Cref{app:fig_downstream}). Overall, 25\% of models shift by $|\Delta\mathrm{Rank}| \geq 100$. The DIF instability pattern extends beyond MMLU; \Cref{sec:gsm8k} presents a full replication on GSM8K.

17	MMLU's 12,508 items provide sufficient measurement redundancy that removing nearly a third does not alter rank order ($\rho \approx 0.997$). DIF should therefore be understood as a diagnostic lens rather than a quality filter. DIF-flagged items concentrate discriminative signal: removing them degrades ranking discriminability more than random removal ($z = -8$ to $-49\sigma$ across 21 conditions). Model families show distinctive DIF profiles: Llama-3 derivatives gain a median of ${+}53$ rank positions under stable-item evaluation, while Mistral-based models lose a median of $35$; 25\% of models shift by $|\Delta\mathrm{Rank}| \geq 100$.

2	\label{sec:conclusion}
3	
4	Applying Mantel-Haenszel DIF analysis to the METABENCH response matrix (5,227 models $\times$ 12,508 MMLU items), we find that 31\% of items are functionally unstable across model generations under ETS Category~C classification. The instability is robust across thresholds (10--49\% at $|\Delta_{\mathrm{MH}}| \in [2.5, 1.0]$), confirmed non-random by a random-split control (0.18\%), and predominantly item-specific: domain accuracy improvement accounts for only 2.4 percentage points of the 31.3\% C\%. This instability does not invalidate MMLU as a ranking instrument ($\rho \approx 0.997$ between full and stable-item rankings) but signals that item-level measurement properties are drifting across model generations.
5	
6	The analysis exposes a validation methodology gap in the contamination detection literature. Web-overlap labels measure whether items exist in publicly accessible training corpora, not whether items function differently across model cohorts. The enrichment between DIF flags and these labels is 0.964 (chance level), the expected outcome when a differential method is evaluated against global-exposure labels. Our semi-synthetic injection framework with cross-subject matching ($\Delta\mathrm{FPR} = 0.000$, $\Delta\mathrm{TPR} = {+}0.508$ at $p = 0.5$) provides a controlled alternative that any item-level detector can use for validation. Cross-benchmark replication on GSM8K ($\Delta\mathrm{TPR} = {+}0.514$) confirms the framework's portability.

8	DIF-flagged items are not noise. They concentrate cross-generational discriminative information ($z = -8\sigma$ to $-49\sigma$ vs.\ random removal) and anti-correlate with the GSM1K contamination gap ($r = -0.478$, $p = 0.005$, $N = 33$), consistent with DIF items capturing genuine capability change that contamination does not confer.

This instability does not invalidate MMLU as a ranking instrument ($\\rho \\approx 0.997$ between full and stable-item rankings) but signals that item-level measurement properties are drifting across model generations.\n\nThe analysis exposes a validation methodology gap in the contamination detection literature. Web-overlap labels measure whether items exist in publicly accessible training corpora, not whether items function differently across model cohorts. The enrichment between DIF flags and these labels is $\\approx 0.96$ (chance level), the expected outcome when a differential method is evaluated against global-exposure labels. Our semi-synthetic injection framework with cross-subject matching ($\\Delta\\mathrm{FPR} = 0.000$, $\\Delta\\mathrm{TPR} = {+}0.508$ at $p = 0.5$) provides a controlled alternative that any item-level detector can use for validation.

Individual extremes within Phi-3 and Llama-3 families reach ${+}793$ rank positions (family medians: ${+}20$ and ${+}53$), while individual Mistral-based models shift by up to $-542$ (family median: $-35$).

[Director 指令] **[Dream #6 后续 — 论文结构性修改指令]**

Dream #6 (EMNLP full review simulation) 三档评分 Best=3.5, Median=3.0, Worst=2.5。以下是跨三档一致的结构性问题，需要论文修改。按优先级排序：

---

### P0: GSM1K 降级（三档一致 Critical/Major）

GSM1K 相关性分析 (N=33, r=-0.478) 被三档 reviewer 一致认为 over-featured。

**执行**:
1. 从 abstract 中移除 GSM1K 相关性的具体描述（保留 GSM8K cross-benchmark replication，不提 GSM1K correlation）
2. 从 conclusion 中移除 GSM1K 作为核心贡献/证据
3. 正文中 GSM1K 结果标注为 "exploratory analysis"（如果还没标注）
4. GSM1K 不再是 Claim 4 的主要支撑——Claim 4 主支撑改为 plan_017 (z=-49σ) + plan_020 (Jaccard=0.12) + plan_023 (ρ=-0.597)

### P1: 强化 Actionability（三档一致 Critical）

三档 reviewer 最一致的批评："diagnosis without prescription"。Discussion 需要添加具体的 DIF audit protocol。

**执行**: 在 Discussion/§5 中添加一段"Recommended DIF Audit Protocol"，包含：
1. **Monitoring frequency**: 每季度或每次新 model cohort 发布时运行 DIF audit
2. **Decision rules**: C% > 20% 触发 item review；individual items 连续 2 次 flagged ETS C → 标记为 unstable
3. **Response options**: (a) Flag-and-annotate (标记 unstable items 但保留), (b) Item rotation (unstable items 替换为等难度新 items), (c) Weighted scoring (降低 unstable items 权重)
4. **Minimum viable protocol**: 只需 response matrix + temporal cohort labels，无需 IRT fitting

### P2: 澄清 Strata Implementation（两档一致）

Method section 描述 K=distinct total scores，但实际使用 5 quantile bins。

**执行**: 在 Method §3.1 中明确说明 "We use K=5 equiprobable strata (quintile-based binning) following Donoghue & Allen (1993) and the ETS recommended practice for large-scale assessments."

### P3: Novelty 定位调整（三档一致 Major）

三档都说 "textbook method transfer"。

**执行**: 在 Introduction 和 Related Work 中调整贡献定位：
1. 不要声称修改了 MH-DIF 方法本身
2. 核心贡献是 **empirical contribution at unprecedented scale** + **ground truth meta-critique** + **semi-synthetic framework with cross-subject matching**
3. 引用 Clauser & Mazor (1998) 和 Nandakumar (1993) 承认 cross-subject matching 的 psychometric precedent，但强调 LLM 特有的创新：multi-domain LD handling + simultaneous contamination control
4. 添加 "benchmark maintenance protocol" (P1) 作为 actionable contribution

### P4: Related Work 补充（三档一致）

缺失关键引用：
1. Rodriguez et al. 2021 "Evaluation Examples Are Not Equally Informative" — IRT-in-NLP
2. Test equating literature（common-item equating, equipercentile equating）— 直接相关 temporal comparability
3. Clauser & Mazor 1998 + Nandakumar 1993 — cross-subject matching precedent
4. Hardy et al. 2026 (如果在 bib 中) — scalability coefficients

如果 references.bib 中缺这些条目，先添加 bib 条目再在正文中引用。

### P5: IRT Misfit 辩护加强

98% |Lz|>2 被三档一致提出。当前 limitations 中有提及但不够充分。

**执行**: 在 Limitations 或 Discussion 中添加 1-2 句辩护：
- "MH-DIF is nonparametric and conditions on observed total score, not latent θ — its validity does not depend on IRT model fit (Holland & Thayer, 1988)."
- 引用 plan_013 结果：LD domains 与 DIF domains 不相关 (r=0.09, p=0.50)

---

**引用验证**: 本轮新增引用需要验证真实性。

**编译**: 修改完成后编译 PDF 确认页数仍在 8 页限制内。

请按 P0→P5 顺序逐步执行，每步完成后 commit。完成后汇报。

1	\begin{abstract}
2	LLM benchmark scores are routinely compared across model generations, yet the assumption that individual items measure the same construct over time is rarely tested. We apply Mantel-Haenszel Differential Item Functioning (DIF) analysis with ETS severity classification to the METABENCH response matrix (5,227 models $\times$ 12,508 MMLU items), and find that 31\% of items exhibit large DIF (ETS Category~C) between 2023 and 2024 model cohorts. This instability does not threaten benchmark validity: Spearman rank correlation between full and stable-item rankings is $\rho \approx 0.997$. Rather, it reveals which capability dimensions shift across model generations. Item-level decomposition shows that domain accuracy improvement explains only 2.4 percentage points (7.6\%) of the instability; 92.4\% is item-specific. We expose a validation methodology gap in the contamination detection literature: web-overlap labels measure global exposure, not differential functioning. Direct comparison confirms near-independence (enrichment $\approx 0.96$). A semi-synthetic injection framework with cross-subject matching preserves detection power ($\Delta\mathrm{TPR} = {+}0.508$ at exploitation rate $p = 0.5$) with zero false positive inflation; cross-benchmark replication on GSM8K confirms generality. DIF-flagged items concentrate cross-generational discriminative information; an exploratory analysis ($N = 33$) finds they anti-correlate with the GSM1K contamination gap ($r = -0.478$, $p = 0.005$), suggesting that DIF captures genuine capability change rather than memorization. LLM benchmarks need psychometric monitoring, not just score reporting.

1	\section{Conclusion}
2	\label{sec:conclusion}
3	
4	Applying Mantel-Haenszel DIF analysis to the METABENCH response matrix (5,227 models $\times$ 12,508 MMLU items), we find that 31\% of items are functionally unstable across model generations under ETS Category~C classification. The instability is robust across thresholds (10--49\% at $|\Delta_{\mathrm{MH}}| \in [2.5, 1.0]$), confirmed non-random by a random-split control (0.18\%), and predominantly item-specific: domain accuracy improvement accounts for only 2.4 percentage points of the 31.3\% C\%. This instability does not invalidate MMLU as a ranking instrument ($\rho \approx 0.997$ between full and stable-item rankings) but signals that item-level measurement properties are drifting across model generations.
5	
6	The analysis exposes a validation methodology gap in the contamination detection literature. Web-overlap labels measure whether items exist in publicly accessible training corpora, not whether items function differently across model cohorts. The enrichment between DIF flags and these labels is $\approx 0.96$ (chance level), the expected outcome when a differential method is evaluated against global-exposure labels. Our semi-synthetic injection framework with cross-subject matching ($\Delta\mathrm{FPR} = 0.000$, $\Delta\mathrm{TPR} = {+}0.508$ at $p = 0.5$) provides a controlled alternative that any item-level detector can use for validation. Cross-benchmark replication on GSM8K ($\Delta\mathrm{TPR} = {+}0.514$) confirms the framework's portability.
7	
8	DIF-flagged items are not noise. They concentrate cross-generational discriminative information ($z = -8\sigma$ to $-49\sigma$ vs.\ random removal) and anti-correlate with the GSM1K contamination gap ($r = -0.478$, $p = 0.005$, $N = 33$), consistent with DIF items capturing genuine capability change that contamination does not confer. Individual extremes within Phi-3 and Llama-3 families reach ${+}793$ rank positions (family medians: ${+}20$ and ${+}53

3	
4	\subsection{Implications for Benchmark Temporal Comparability}
5	\label{sec:disc_temporal}
6	
7	The 31\% ETS~C instability rate is robust across thresholds (10--49\% at $|\Delta_{\mathrm{MH}}| \in [2.5, 1.0]$) and confirmed by structural controls (\Cref{sec:structural}). The temporal cohort ability gap is negligible ($d = -0.17$, overlap $= 76.4\%$); ability-matched C\% of $28.9\% \pm 0.1\%$ confirms the 31.3\% rate is not inflated by impact confounding. Domain accuracy improvement explains only 2.4 pp of 31.3\% C\%; 92.4\% is item-specific. This does not invalidate MMLU as a ranking instrument ($\rho \approx 0.997$) but signals measurement drift across model generations.
8	
9	\subsection{Ground Truth Meta-Critique}
10	\label{sec:disc_groundtruth}
11	
12	The near-independence between DIF flags and web-overlap labels (enrichment $= 0.964$, Jaccard $= 0.206$, $\phi = 0.012$; consistent across contamination subtypes) exposes a broader gap: the dominant validation practice of evaluating contamination detectors against web-overlap labels conflates global exposure with differential functioning. Most MMLU items appear in web text, so web-overlap labels identify a condition shared by nearly all items. This near-independence is the expected outcome when a differential method is evaluated against a global-exposure reference. Item-level differential detectors require item-level differential ground truth.
13	
14	\subsection{DIF as Diagnostic Lens}
15	\label{sec:disc_diagnostic}
16	
17	The GSM1K correlation ($r = -0.478$, $p = 0.005$, $N = 33$; \Cref{sec:gsm8k}) provides exploratory evidence that DIF-flagged items capture behavioral change distinct from memorization. Models with larger contamination gaps benefit \emph{less} from DIF-C items. Of the 249 DIF-C items on GSM8K, 171 favor the reference (2023) cohort ($\alpha_{\mathrm{MH}} > 1$). Partial correlation ($r = -0.385$, $p = 0.027$) after controlling for accuracy confirms

14	In educational testing, Differential Item Functioning (DIF) occurs when an item's statistical relationship to the latent trait $\theta$ differs between two groups after conditioning on ability level. An item with DIF is not merely harder for one group; it functions differently relative to what the group's overall ability would predict. The standard terminology refers to test-takers as ``examinees'' and questions as ``items.'' In our setting, examinees are LLMs and items are benchmark questions.
15	
16	The Mantel-Haenszel (MH) procedure~\citep{holland1988mh} detects DIF by stratifying examinees into $K$ score bins based on total score (a proxy for $\theta$), where $K$ equals the number of distinct total scores observed in the combined sample, and computing a common odds ratio across strata. Within each stratum $k$, the responses of the reference group and the focal group form a $2 \times 2$ contingency table:
17	
18	\begin{equation}
19	\label{eq:mh}
20	\alpha_{\mathrm{MH}} = \frac{\displaystyle\sum_{k=1}^{K} A_k D_k \,/\, T_k}{\displaystyle\sum_{k=1}^{K} B_k C_k \,/\, T_k}\,,
21	\end{equation}
22	
23	\noindent where $A_k$ and $B_k$ are the number of correct and incorrect responses in the reference group for stratum $k$, $C_k$ and $D_k$ are the corresponding counts for the focal group, and $T_k$ is the total number of examinees in stratum $k$. Under the null hypothesis of no DIF, $\alpha_{\mathrm{MH}} = 1$. The log odds ratio is converted to the ETS delta scale:

19	We do not modify the MH-DIF procedure itself; the contributions are empirical, not algorithmic. Three layers of genuine novelty emerge: (a)~we discover that 31\% temporal instability is robust across thresholds and unrelated to aggregate domain-level accuracy gains, the first large-scale characterization of item-level benchmark stability at 5,227 models; (b)~we expose a fundamental validation methodology gap in the contamination detection literature, showing that web-overlap labels are poorly suited to evaluate item-level differential detectors; and (c)~we provide a reusable semi-synthetic validation framework with cross-subject matching ($\Delta\mathrm{FPR} = 0.000$), confirmed on GSM8K with independent contamination validation through the GSM1K held-out set~\citep{zhang2024gsm1k}. We make the following contributions:
20	
21	\begin{enumerate}
22	\item \textbf{Benchmark temporal comparability} (Claim 1): 31\% of MMLU items are functionally unstable across model generations under ETS~C classification, with C\% ranging from 21\% to 48\% across all 57 subjects (mean $\approx 30\%$) and confirmed non-random by random-split control at 0.18\% (\Cref{sec:temporal}).
23	
24	\item \textbf{Ground truth meta-critique} (Claim 2): Web-overlap contamination labels~\citep{li2024contamination} do not provide appropriate ground truth for item-level differential detectors. Direct empirical comparison on 9,229 items shows near-independence (enrichment $= 0.964$, Jaccard $= 0.206$, $\phi = 0.012$), exposing a validation methodology gap in the contamination detection literature (\Cref{sec:groundtruth}).
25	
26	\item \textbf{Semi-synthetic validation framework} (Claim 3): Controlled injection with cross-subject matching achieves $\Delta\mathrm{FPR} = 0.000$ while preserving detection power ($\Delta\mathrm{TPR} = {+}0.508$ at $p = 0.5$); cross-benchmark replication on GSM8K confirms generality (\Cref{sec:semisynthetic,sec:gsm8k}).

28	\item \textbf{DIF as diagnostic lens} (Claim 4):

4	\paragraph{Contamination Detection.}
5	A growing family of methods detects benchmark contamination through model behavior or training data analysis. Membership inference approaches estimate whether a model has seen specific items during training: Min-K\% \citep{shi2024mink} and Min-K\%++ \citep{zhang2024minkpp} use token-level log-likelihood statistics, while Time Travel \citep{golchin2024timetravel} probes models with temporal cues. Performance-based detectors identify contamination through statistical anomalies: ConStat \citep{dekoninck2024constat} tests performance gaps between original and perturbed items, DVD \citep{liang2026dvd} uses distributional verification, and Self-Critique \citep{tao2026selfcritique} employs model self-evaluation. \citet{balloccu2024leak} provide a broader taxonomy of leakage detection strategies. These methods share a common validation practice: they verify detection accuracy against web-overlap or n-gram labels \citep{li2024contamination} that classify items based on verbatim matches in publicly accessible corpora. Such labels measure \emph{global exposure} (whether an item exists in training data) rather than \emph{differential item functioning} (whether an item behaves differently across model cohorts). This global-vs-differential distinction motivates our ground truth analysis (Claim~2, \Cref{sec:groundtruth}). Work on LLM memorization \citep{carlini2022quantifying, tirumala2022memorization} establishes that memorization depends on data frequency and model scale, reinforcing the distinction between global exposure and differential behavior. \citet{wang2026fragility} show that existing contamination detectors are fragile under reinforcement learning, further motivating behavioral approaches grounded in psychometric theory.

1	\section*{Limitations}
2	
3	\paragraph{Methodological scope of MH-DIF.}
4	The Mantel-Haenszel procedure detects only \emph{uniform} DIF, where the odds ratio between cohorts is constant across ability strata. Logistic regression DIF analysis reveals an additional 24.8\% of items exhibiting non-uniform DIF ($|\beta_{\mathrm{interaction}}| \geq 0.5$), making the 31\% ETS~C estimate conservative. Future work should apply non-uniform DIF methods (e.g., logistic regression or IRT-based approaches) as the primary analysis to capture the full spectrum of item instability.
5	
6	\paragraph{Ability confounding.}
7	Although the temporal cohort ability gap is negligible (Cohen's $d = -0.17$, overlap $= 76.4\%$) and nearest-neighbor matching confirms that at most 2.4 percentage points of C\% are attributable to ability mismatch, within-family comparisons with large ability gaps (e.g., Llama-2 vs.\ Llama-3, $d = -0.99$) produce substantially inflated C\% (61.3\% unmatched vs.\ 28.3\% matched). Any application of MH-DIF to cohorts with larger ability differences must incorporate ability matching or stratification beyond the standard 5-strata procedure.
8	
9	\paragraph{Sample size requirements.}
10	Our power analysis indicates reliable ETS~C detection requires $N \geq 80$ per cohort. The temporal cohorts (1,080 and 807 models) far exceed this threshold, but the GSM1K correlation analysis ($N = 33$) has limited statistical power (95\% CI $= [-0.71, -0.16]$). The negative correlation between contamination gap and DIF ranking advantage ($r = -0.478$) is exploratory and warrants replication with larger model samples.
11	
12	\paragraph{Contamination vs.\ capability change.}
13	DIF analysis detects \emph{that} items function differently across cohorts but cannot determine \emph{why}. The differential signal may reflect contamination, capability change, training methodology shifts, or interactions among these factors. We present evidence that DIF captures something distinct from memoriz

1	\section{Conclusion}
2	\label{sec:conclusion}
3	
4	Applying Mantel-Haenszel DIF analysis to the METABENCH response matrix (5,227 models $\times$ 12,508 MMLU items), we find that 31\% of items are functionally unstable across model generations under ETS Category~C classification. The instability is robust across thresholds (10--49\% at $|\Delta_{\mathrm{MH}}| \in [2.5, 1.0]$), confirmed non-random by a random-split control (0.18\%), and predominantly item-specific: domain accuracy improvement accounts for only 2.4 percentage points of the 31.3\% C\%. This instability does not invalidate MMLU as a ranking instrument ($\rho \approx 0.997$ between full and stable-item rankings) but signals that item-level measurement properties are drifting across model generations.
5	
6	The analysis exposes a validation methodology gap in the contamination detection literature. Web-overlap labels measure whether items exist in publicly accessible training corpora, not whether items function differently across model cohorts. The enrichment between DIF flags and these labels is $\approx 0.96$ (chance level), the expected outcome when a differential method is evaluated against global-exposure labels. Our semi-synthetic injection framework with cross-subject matching ($\Delta\mathrm{FPR} = 0.000$, $\Delta\mathrm{TPR} = {+}0.508$ at $p = 0.5$) provides a controlled alternative that any item-level detector can use for validation. Cross-benchmark replication on GSM8K ($\Delta\mathrm{TPR} = {+}0.514$) confirms the framework's portability.
7	
8	DIF-flagged items are not noise. They concentrate cross-generational discriminative information ($z = -8\sigma$ to $-49\sigma$ vs.\ random removal) with minimal overlap with high-discrimination items (Jaccard $= 0.12$). A difficulty--direction interaction ($\rho = -0.597$, $p < 0.001$) reveals that capability gains concentrate on hard items (88.7\% focal-favoring in the hardest decile) while easy items erode, suggesting DIF captures structured capabili

25	\subsection{Recommended DIF Audit Protocol}
26	\label{sec:disc_protocol}
27	
28	These findings motivate a concrete benchmark maintenance protocol. The minimum viable DIF audit requires only a binary response matrix and temporal cohort labels; no IRT model fitting is needed. We recommend the following:
29	
30	\paragraph{Monitoring frequency.} Run a full MH-DIF audit each quarter or whenever a new model cohort ($N \geq 80$) becomes available on public leaderboards. Cross-subject matching should be the default stratification protocol for multi-domain benchmarks.
31	
32	\paragraph{Decision rules.} A benchmark-wide C\% exceeding 20\% should trigger item-level review. Individual items flagged as ETS~C in two or more consecutive audits should be labeled ``unstable'' and tracked separately from stable items.
33

[Director 指令] [Patch] plan_028 Multi-Benchmark Temporal DIF 完成 + plan_030 Odds Ratio 已完成，整合进论文。

**新数据**：

plan_028 — 6/6 METABENCH benchmarks 的 temporal DIF 结果：
| Benchmark | Items | C% | Random C% | Ratio |
|-----------|-------|----|-----------|-------|
| MMLU | 12,508 | 31.3% | 0.18% | 174× |
| WinoGrande | 1,267 | 30.3% | 0.32% | 95× |
| TruthfulQA | 817 | 29.7% | 0.37% | 80× |
| ARC | 1,172 | 26.9% | 0.60% | 45× |
| GSM8K | 1,319 | 18.9% | 0.30% | 63× |
| HellaSwag | 10,042 | 17.9% | 0.28% | 64× |

关键发现：知识/推理类 (MMLU, TruthfulQA, ARC, WinoGrande) C%=26.9-31.3%；数学/常识类 (GSM8K, HellaSwag) C%=17.9-18.9%。

plan_030 — Odds ratio regression 发现 Simpson's paradox：控制 item properties 后 accuracy change 的 OR 反转。

**修改要求**：
1. §4 Results 新增 cross-benchmark summary table（上面的 6-row table）
2. §4 补充 benchmark 类型分化讨论（knowledge vs math/commonsense）
3. §5 Discussion 更新泛化性论证——从 "MMLU + GSM8K" 升级为 "6 个 benchmark 的 universal phenomenon"
4. Abstract 和 Introduction 中涉及 benchmark 数量的描述更新（"two" → "six"）
5. plan_030 odds ratio + Simpson's paradox 结果整合到 §4.3 或新增小节
6. Conclusion 更新 generalizability claim

这次不用验证引用。整合完成后通知我，我会触发 re-dream。

1	\begin{abstract}
2	LLM benchmark scores are routinely compared across model generations, yet the assumption that individual items measure the same construct over time is rarely tested. We apply Mantel-Haenszel Differential Item Functioning (DIF) analysis with ETS severity classification to the METABENCH response matrix (5,227 models $\times$ 12,508 MMLU items), and find that 31\% of items exhibit large DIF (ETS Category~C) between 2023 and 2024 model cohorts. This instability does not threaten benchmark validity: Spearman rank correlation between full and stable-item rankings is $\rho \approx 0.997$. Rather, it reveals which capability dimensions shift across model generations. Item-level decomposition shows that domain accuracy improvement explains only 2.4 percentage points (7.6\%) of the instability; 92.4\% is item-specific. We expose a validation methodology gap in the contamination detection literature: web-overlap labels measure global exposure, not differential functioning. Direct comparison confirms near-independence (enrichment $\approx 0.96$). A semi-synthetic injection framework with cross-subject matching preserves detection power ($\Delta\mathrm{TPR} = {+}0.508$ at exploitation rate $p = 0.5$) with zero false positive inflation; cross-benchmark replication on GSM8K confirms generality. DIF-flagged items concentrate cross-generational discriminative information ($z = -8\sigma$ to $-49\sigma$ vs.\ random removal), and a difficulty--direction interaction ($\rho = -0.597$) reveals that capability gains concentrate on hard items while easy items erode, suggesting DIF captures genuine capability change rather than noise. LLM benchmarks need psychometric monitoring, not just score reporting.

1	\section{Introduction}
2	\label{sec:introduction}
3	
4	When we say ``Model B outperforms Model A on MMLU,'' we implicitly assume that the benchmark measures the same construct in the same way for both models. This assumption of temporal comparability underpins every cross-generation comparison published on leaderboards and in model reports, yet it is rarely tested. We apply Mantel-Haenszel Differential Item Functioning (MH-DIF) analysis~\citep{holland1988mh} with Educational Testing Service (ETS) severity classification to the METABENCH response matrix~\citep{kipnis2024metabench}, and find that 31\% of MMLU~\citep{hendrycks2021mmlu} items receive ETS Category~C classification ($|\Delta_{\mathrm{MH}}| \geq 1.5$, $p < 0.05$), indicating large shifts in item functioning between models released in 2023 and 2024. This is not statistical noise: a random-split control within the 2023 cohort yields only 0.18\% ETS~C items. The instability persists across all 57 MMLU subjects (C\% range 21--48\%, unweighted mean $\approx 30\%$), and item-level regression shows that 92.4\% of this instability is unrelated to aggregate domain-level accuracy gains. Nearly one in three MMLU items behaves differently depending on when the evaluated models were trained. Crucially, this instability does not threaten benchmark validity: Spearman rank correlation between model rankings computed on all items versus stable-only items is $\rho \approx 0.997$. The instability is diagnostic, not destructive; it reveals which capability dimensions shift across model generations rather than rendering MMLU scores unreliable.
5	
6	A growing body of contamination detection research has produced sophisticated item-level methods, from membership inference approaches such as Min-K\%~\citep{shi2024mink} to performance-based detectors such as ConStat~\citep{dekoninck2024constat}, DVD~\citep{liang2026dvd}, and Self-Critique~\citep{tao2026selfcritique}. These methods validate detection accuracy primarily against we

1	\section{Experiments}
2	\label{sec:experiments}
3	
4	We apply MH-DIF to the METABENCH response matrix~\citep{kipnis2024metabench} (5,227 models $\times$ 12,508 MMLU items~\citep{hendrycks2021mmlu}), with temporal cohorts defined by release date (2023 vs.\ 2024). Cross-benchmark replication on GSM8K appears in \Cref{sec:gsm8k}.
5	
6	\subsection{Validation: DIF Detection Power}
7	\label{sec:validation}
8	
9	A power analysis using empirical MMLU IRT parameters confirms that at $N \geq 80$ per cohort, ETS~C achieves TPR of 0.68--0.80, FPR of 0.036--0.042, and AUC of 0.93--0.94 for items with $|\Delta_{\mathrm{MH}}| \geq 1.4$. Our temporal cohorts ($N_{\mathrm{ref}} = 1{,}080$, $N_{\mathrm{focal}} = 807$) far exceed this threshold.
10	
11	\subsection{Temporal Comparability: 31\% Item Instability}
12	\label{sec:temporal}
13	
14	We compare 2023 ($N = 1{,}080$) against 2024 ($N = 807$) models; 31.3\% of items receive ETS~C classification ($|\Delta_{\mathrm{MH}}| \geq 1.5$). Benjamini-Hochberg FDR correction at $q = 0.05$ removes only 3 items (31.32\% $\to$ 31.30\%), because the dual ETS threshold on effect size and significance already provides implicit multiple-testing protection.
15	
16	Three controls confirm this reflects genuine temporal change. A random split of the 2023 cohort yields only 0.18\% ETS~C items (sampling noise), and an ability-quintile comparison within the same temporal cohort yields 2.9\% (ability differences alone). A within-family comparison (Llama-2 vs.\ Llama-3) produces 61.3\% ETS~C items, elevated by large ability gaps that confound the DIF signal~\citep{holland1988mh}. The contrast between 2.9\% (ability-controlled) and 61.3\% (ability-confounded) brackets the temporal rate of 31.3\%. Crucially, the temporal cohort ability gap is negligible: Cohen's $d = -0.17$ (below the $|d| = 0.2$ small-effect threshold) with 76.4\% distributional overlap. Under strict 1:1 nearest-neighbor matching ($d \approx -0.010$, $N = 638$ per group, 5 seeds), C\% $= 2

4	\subsection{Diagnostics}
5	\label{app:diagnostics}
6	
7	Three diagnostic procedures complement the primary DIF analysis.
8	
9	\paragraph{Local independence (Yen's Q3).} The MH procedure assumes that item responses are conditionally independent given $\theta$. Yen's Q3 statistic measures residual correlations between item pairs after conditioning on the latent trait. We compute Q3 for all within-subject and cross-subject item pairs, with $|Q3| > 0.20$ as the threshold for local dependence. Elevated within-subject dependence would indicate that items within the same subject share variance beyond what $\theta$ captures, which could inflate within-subject DIF rates.
10	
11	\paragraph{Domain-specificity.} We test whether temporal DIF concentrates in domains where models improved most. At the ecological level, we compute Spearman $\rho$ between subject-level C\% and subject-level accuracy improvement from 2023 to 2024. At the item level, logistic regression predicts item-level DIF~C classification from domain-level accuracy change, with and without item property controls (difficulty, discrimination). This decomposition quantifies how much of the observed instability is attributable to aggregate domain-level gains versus item-specific behavioral change.
12	
13	\paragraph{Instability decomposition.} When domain accuracy improvement is included alongside item-level controls, we compute the counterfactual C\% that would remain after removing domain-level effects. The gap between observed and counterfactual C\% measures the contribution of domain-level improvement to the total instability.
14	
15	\subsection{Statistical Considerations}
16	\label{app:statistical}
17	
18	\paragraph{Multiple testing.} The ETS~C classification imposes a dual threshold (effect size $|\Delta_{\mathrm{MH}}| \geq 1.5$ and significance $p < 0.05$), which provides implicit control over false positives. As a robustness check, we apply Benjamini

6	
7	The 31\% ETS~C instability rate is robust across thresholds (10--49\% at $|\Delta_{\mathrm{MH}}| \in [2.5, 1.0]$) and confirmed by structural controls (\Cref{sec:structural}). The temporal cohort ability gap is negligible ($d = -0.17$, overlap $= 76.4\%$); ability-matched C\% of $28.9\% \pm 0.1\%$ confirms the 31.3\% rate is not inflated by impact confounding. Domain accuracy improvement explains only 2.4 pp of 31.3\% C\%; 92.4\% is item-specific. This does not invalidate MMLU as a ranking instrument ($\rho \approx 0.997$) but signals measurement drift across model generations.

11	
12	The near-independence between DIF flags and web-overlap labels (enrichment $= 0.964$, Jaccard $= 0.206$, $\phi = 0.012$; consistent across contamination subtypes) exposes a broader gap: the dominant validation practice of evaluating contamination detectors against web-overlap labels conflates global exposure with differential functioning. Most MMLU items appear in web text, so web-overlap labels identify a condition shared by nearly all items. This near-independence is the expected outcome when a differential method is evaluated against a global-exposure reference. Item-level differential detectors require item-level differential ground truth.

17	The GSM1K correlation ($r = -0.478$, $p = 0.005$, $N = 33$; \Cref{sec:gsm8k}) provides exploratory evidence that DIF-flagged items capture behavioral change distinct from memorization. Models with larger contamination gaps benefit \emph{less} from DIF-C items. Of the 249 DIF-C items on GSM8K, 171 favor the reference (2023) cohort ($\alpha_{\mathrm{MH}} > 1$). Partial correlation ($r = -0.385$, $p = 0.027$) after controlling for accuracy confirms

1	\section{Conclusion}
2	\label{sec:conclusion}
3	
4	Applying Mantel-Haenszel DIF analysis to the METABENCH response matrix (5,227 models $\times$ 12,508 MMLU items), we find that 31\% of items are functionally unstable across model generations under ETS Category~C classification. The instability is robust across thresholds (10--49\% at $|\Delta_{\mathrm{MH}}| \in [2.5, 1.0]$), confirmed non-random by a random-split control (0.18\%), and predominantly item-specific (92.4\%). This does not invalidate MMLU as a ranking instrument ($\rho \approx 0.997$) but signals measurement drift. Web-overlap contamination labels show near-independence with DIF flags (enrichment $\approx 0.96$), exposing a validation methodology gap; our semi-synthetic framework with cross-subject matching ($\Delta\mathrm{FPR} = 0.000$, $\Delta\mathrm{TPR} = {+}0.508$) provides a controlled alternative, confirmed on GSM8K.
5	
6	DIF-flagged items concentrate discriminative information ($z = -8\sigma$ to $-49\sigma$ vs.\ random removal, Jaccard with high-discrimination items $= 0.12$) and exhibit a structured difficulty--direction interaction ($\rho = -0.597$): capability gains concentrate on hard items while easy items erode. DIF is a diagnostic lens, not a quality filter. LLM benchmarks need psychometric monitoring---periodic DIF audits, item-level stability labels, and cross-subject matching---alongside score reporting.

1	\section*{Limitations}
2	
3	\paragraph{Methodological scope of MH-DIF.}
4	The Mantel-Haenszel procedure detects only \emph{uniform} DIF, where the odds ratio between cohorts is constant across ability strata. Logistic regression DIF analysis reveals an additional 24.8\% of items exhibiting non-uniform DIF ($|\beta_{\mathrm{interaction}}| \geq 0.5$), making the 31\% ETS~C estimate conservative. Future work should apply non-uniform DIF methods (e.g., logistic regression or IRT-based approaches) as the primary analysis to capture the full spectrum of item instability. Critically, MH-DIF is nonparametric and conditions on observed total score, not latent $\theta$---its validity does not depend on IRT model fit~\citep{holland1988mh}. Our Yen's Q3 analysis confirms that local dependence domains do not correlate with DIF domains ($r = 0.09$, $p = 0.50$), further supporting the robustness of the MH procedure in this setting.
5	
6	\paragraph{Ability confounding.}
7	Although the temporal cohort ability gap is negligible (Cohen's $d = -0.17$, overlap $= 76.4\%$) and nearest-neighbor matching confirms that at most 2.4 percentage points of C\% are attributable to ability mismatch, within-family comparisons with large ability gaps (e.g., Llama-2 vs.\ Llama-3, $d = -0.99$) produce substantially inflated C\% (61.3\% unmatched vs.\ 28.3\% matched). Any application of MH-DIF to cohorts with larger ability differences must incorporate ability matching or stratification beyond the standard 5-strata procedure.
8	
9	\paragraph{Sample size requirements.}
10	Our power analysis indicates reliable ETS~C detection requires $N \geq 80$ per cohort. The temporal cohorts (1,080 and 807 models) far exceed this threshold, but the GSM1K correlation analysis ($N = 33$) has limited statistical power (95\% CI $= [-0.71, -0.16]$). The negative correlation between contamination gap and DIF ranking advantage ($r = -0.478$) is exploratory and warrants replication with larger model samples.

1	\begin{abstract}
2	LLM benchmark scores are routinely compared across model generations, yet the assumption that individual items measure the same construct over time is rarely tested. We apply Mantel-Haenszel Differential Item Functioning (DIF) analysis with ETS severity classification to six METABENCH benchmarks (5,227 models, 27,125 total items), and find that 17.9--31.3\% of items exhibit large DIF (ETS Category~C) between 2023 and 2024 model cohorts. This instability does not threaten benchmark validity: Spearman rank correlation between full and stable-item rankings is $\rho \approx 0.997$. Rather, it reveals which capability dimensions shift across model generations. Item-level decomposition shows that domain accuracy improvement explains only 2.4 percentage points (7.6\%) of the instability; 92.4\% is item-specific. We expose a validation methodology gap in the contamination detection literature: web-overlap labels measure global exposure, not differential functioning. Direct comparison confirms near-independence (enrichment $\approx 0.96$). A semi-synthetic injection framework with cross-subject matching preserves detection power ($\Delta\mathrm{TPR} = {+}0.508$ at exploitation rate $p = 0.5$) with zero false positive inflation. Cross-benchmark analysis of all six METABENCH benchmarks confirms universality: C\% ranges from 17.9\% to 31.3\% (45--174$\times$ above random baselines), with knowledge/reasoning benchmarks showing higher instability than procedural ones. DIF-flagged items concentrate cross-generational discriminative information ($z = -8\sigma$ to $-49\sigma$ vs.\ random removal), and a difficulty--direction interaction ($\rho = -0.597$) reveals that capability gains concentrate on hard items while easy items erode, suggesting DIF captures genuine capability change rather than noise. LLM benchmarks need psychometric monitoring, not just score reporting.

1	\section{Conclusion}
2	\label{sec:conclusion}
3	
4	Applying MH-DIF analysis to six METABENCH benchmarks (27,125 items, 5,227 models), we find 17.9--31.3\% temporal item instability under ETS~C classification---knowledge/reasoning benchmarks are more affected (C\% $\geq 26.9\%$) than procedural ones (C\% $\leq 18.9\%$). The instability is confirmed non-random (random controls $\leq 0.6\%$) and item-specific; a Simpson's paradox in odds ratio regression confirms item properties, not accuracy gains, drive DIF. Web-overlap labels show near-independence with DIF flags (enrichment $\approx 0.96$); our semi-synthetic framework ($\Delta\mathrm{FPR} = 0.000$, $\Delta\mathrm{TPR} = {+}0.508$) provides a controlled alternative.
5	
6	DIF-flagged items concentrate discriminative information ($z = -8\sigma$ to $-49\sigma$ vs.\ random removal) and exhibit a difficulty--direction interaction ($\rho = -0.597$): capability gains on hard items, erosion on easy ones. DIF is a diagnostic lens, not a quality filter. LLM benchmarks need psychometric monitoring alongside score reporting.

[Director 指令] [Patch] Dream #7 审稿反馈修复 — 5 项写作修改

Dream #7 Best=3.5，距 4.0 差 0.5。Best 档明确指出 3.5→4.0 路径："(a) detector comparison, (b) code release, (c) causal language softened"。以下修改全部是 Dream 三档一致或 Best 明确要求的。

### P6: 审计协议扩展（三档一致，CW6）
§5 的 DIF audit protocol 目前只有 3 句话，被三档审稿人一致批评为"sketch, not protocol"。扩展为完整段落：
- 审计频率（quarterly）+ 触发条件（new model cohort > 500）
- C% threshold + graduated responses（flagging → monitoring → replacement）
- Worked example：用 MMLU 数据展示如何从 DIF flags 到具体行动
- 处理 flip-flop items（跨审计期分类不稳定的 items）的策略

### P7: Code release 承诺（Best CW4）
在 Reproducibility/Ethics 或 Abstract 添加一句："Analysis code and DIF audit scripts are available at [anonymous repository URL]."

### P8: 因果语言 + 半合成 framing 修复（三档一致，CW2+CW5）
- Abstract 和 Introduction 中的 contamination-adjacent 语言需要更一致的 hedging（"temporal construct shift" 而非暗示 contamination）
- Semi-synthetic 部分明确区分："validates detection sensitivity, not interpretation of observed DIF"
- 加一句明确声明：MH-DIF detects THAT items function differently, not WHY

### P9: "What DIF means for LLMs" 段落（B+M 两档，I12）
Discussion 新增段落，明确讨论 DIF 从教育公平到 LLM 评估的 framework transplant：
- 教育中 DIF 关心 demographic subgroup fairness，LLM 中关心 temporal measurement invariance
- "Differential functioning across model cohorts" 告诉 practitioners 的是：benchmark 的测量属性随时间不稳定，即使 rankings 稳定（ρ=0.997），item-level 测量质量在变化
- 这对 benchmark 维护者（不只是排行榜用户）有直接实践意义

### P10: 确认 plan_026 ConStat detector comparison 足够显眼
Best 档 CW1 说"no comparison with existing contamination detectors"是 3.5→4.0 的首要阻碍。但我们 plan_026 已经有 ConStat 经验比较（enrichment=0.964, Jaccard=0.206）。检查 §4.3 中这个结果是否被充分展示——如果只是一句话提及，需要扩展为明确的 "Empirical comparison with behavioral detector" 小节或加粗突出。确保论文读者不会 miss 这个关键数据点。

这次不用验证引用。完成后通知我。

5	\label{sec:disc_temporal}
6	
7	The 31\% ETS~C instability on MMLU is robust across thresholds and structural controls (\Cref{sec:structural}), and extends across all six METABENCH benchmarks (C\% $= 17.9$--$31.3\%$, 45--174$\times$ above random baselines; \Cref{tab:cross_benchmark}). Knowledge/reasoning benchmarks show higher instability (C\% $\geq 26.9\%$) than procedural ones (C\% $\leq 18.9\%$), and a Simpson's paradox in odds ratio regression ($\mathrm{OR}: 1.55 \to 0.73$ after controlling for item properties; LR $\chi^2 = 647$) confirms that item properties---not accuracy gains---drive DIF. This does not invalidate these benchmarks as ranking instruments ($\rho \approx 0.997$) but signals measurement drift across model generations.

9	\subsection{Ground Truth Meta-Critique}
10	\label{sec:disc_groundtruth}
11	
12	The near-independence between DIF flags and web-overlap labels (enrichment $= 0.964$, Jaccard $= 0.206$, $\phi = 0.012$; consistent across contamination subtypes) exposes a category error: web-overlap labels identify a condition shared by nearly all MMLU items (global exposure), so evaluating a differential method against them conflates two phenomena. Item-level differential detectors require item-level differential ground truth.
13	
14	\subsection{DIF as Diagnostic Lens}
15	\label{sec:disc_diagnostic}
16	
17	The GSM1K correlation ($r = -0.478$, $p = 0.005$, $N = 33$; \Cref{sec:gsm8k}) provides exploratory evidence that DIF-flagged items capture behavioral change distinct from memorization; partial correlation ($r = -0.385$, $p = 0.027$) after controlling for accuracy confirms this is not an artifact of general model quality.
18	
19	Item characterization reinforces this: DIF-C items are harder ($d = -0.247$) and more discriminating ($d = 0.230$), distributed uniformly across subjects ($\chi^2$ $p = 0.32$). A difficulty $\times$ directi

1	\begin{abstract}
2	LLM benchmark scores are routinely compared across model generations, yet the assumption that individual items measure the same construct over time is rarely tested. We apply Mantel-Haenszel Differential Item Functioning (DIF) analysis with ETS severity classification to six METABENCH benchmarks (5,227 models, 27,125 total items), and find that 17.9--31.3\% of items exhibit large DIF (ETS Category~C) between 2023 and 2024 model cohorts---knowledge/reasoning benchmarks show higher instability (C\% $\geq 26.9\%$) than procedural ones (C\% $\leq 18.9\%$), each 45--174$\times$ above random baselines. This does not threaten benchmark validity ($\rho \approx 0.997$ between full and stable-item rankings) but reveals which capability dimensions shift across generations. Item-level decomposition shows 92.4\% of instability is item-specific; a Simpson's paradox in odds ratio regression confirms item properties, not accuracy gains, drive DIF. We expose a validation methodology gap: web-overlap labels measure global exposure, not differential functioning (enrichment $\approx 0.96$). A semi-synthetic injection framework with cross-subject matching preserves detection power ($\Delta\mathrm{TPR} = {+}0.508$ at $p = 0.5$) with zero false positive inflation. DIF-flagged items concentrate cross-generational discriminative information ($z = -8\sigma$ to $-49\sigma$ vs.\ random removal), and a difficulty--direction interaction ($\rho = -0.597$) reveals that capability gains concentrate on hard items while easy items erode, suggesting DIF captures genuine capability change rather than noise. LLM benchmarks need psychometric monitoring, not just score reporting.

1	\section{Introduction}
2	\label{sec:introduction}
3	
4	When we say ``Model B outperforms Model A on MMLU,'' we implicitly assume that the benchmark measures the same construct in the same way for both models. This assumption of temporal comparability underpins every cross-generation comparison published on leaderboards and in model reports, yet it is rarely tested. We apply Mantel-Haenszel Differential Item Functioning (MH-DIF) analysis~\citep{holland1988mh} with Educational Testing Service (ETS) severity classification to the METABENCH response matrix~\citep{kipnis2024metabench}, and find that 31\% of MMLU~\citep{hendrycks2021mmlu} items receive ETS Category~C classification ($|\Delta_{\mathrm{MH}}| \geq 1.5$, $p < 0.05$), indicating large shifts in item functioning between models released in 2023 and 2024. This is not statistical noise: a random-split control within the 2023 cohort yields only 0.18\% ETS~C items. The instability persists across all 57 MMLU subjects (C\% range 21--48\%, unweighted mean $\approx 30\%$), and item-level regression shows that 92.4\% of this instability is unrelated to aggregate domain-level accuracy gains. Nearly one in three MMLU items behaves differently depending on when the evaluated models were trained. Crucially, this instability does not threaten benchmark validity: Spearman rank correlation between model rankings computed on all items versus stable-only items is $\rho \approx 0.997$. The instability is diagnostic, not destructive; it reveals which capability dimensions shift across model generations rather than rendering MMLU scores unreliable.
5	
6	A growing body of contamination detection research has produced sophisticated item-level methods, from membership inference approaches such as Min-K\%~\citep{shi2024mink} to performance-based detectors such as ConStat~\citep{dekoninck2024constat}, DVD~\citep{liang2026dvd}, and Self-Critique~\citep{tao2026selfcritique}. These methods validate detection accuracy primarily against we

39	\subsection{Ground Truth Mismatch}
40	\label{sec:groundtruth}
41	
42	Direct comparison of DIF flags against the web-overlap labels of \citet{li2024contamination} on 9,229 annotated items confirms that the two methods capture orthogonal signals. The enrichment ratio is 0.964 (\Cref{tab:temporal_landscape}): DIF-C rates are 30.7\% among web-contaminated items and 31.8\% among clean items. Association tests yield $\phi = 0.012$, $\chi^2 = 1.28$ ($p = 0.258$), and OR $= 1.05$ [0.96, 1.15]; the Jaccard index between flagged sets is 0.206. This near-independence holds across contamination subtypes (input-only enrichment $= 0.986$, input-and-label $= 0.960$). The null result does not indicate detection failure: semi-synthetic injection produces a clear dose-response ($\Delta\mathrm{TPR} = {+}0.508$ at $p = 0.5$; \Cref{fig:dose_response}). The disconnect arises because web-overlap labels measure \emph{global exposure} (whether an item exists in training corpora), while DIF measures \emph{differential functioning} (whether an item's relationship to ability changes across cohorts). The Li et al.\ labels are the wrong ground truth for a differential method.

1	\section{Method}
2	\label{sec:method}
3	
4	We adopt Differential Item Functioning (DIF) analysis from educational measurement to assess whether individual benchmark items behave consistently across groups of LLMs. The procedure requires only a binary response matrix and group labels, with no access to model internals or training data. Below we define the data, the statistical test, the cohort designs, and a semi-synthetic validation framework.
5	
6	\subsection{Data}
7	\label{sec:data}
8	
9	The primary dataset is the METABENCH response matrix~\citep{kipnis2024metabench}, which records binary outcomes (1~=~correct, 0~=~incorrect) for 5,227 models evaluated on 12,508 MMLU items~\citep{hendrycks2021mmlu}. Models span release dates from 2023 to 2024, drawn from the Open LLM Leaderboard. MMLU covers 57 subjects grouped into five broad domains (STEM, Humanities, Social Sciences, Other, and a mixed category). We supplement the response matrix with the web-overlap contamination labels of \citet{li2024contamination}, which classify 9,229 of 12,508 items (73.8\% coverage) as ``contaminated'' or ``clean'' based on verbatim matches in publicly accessible web corpora. These labels serve as an external reference for evaluating the relationship between DIF flags and existing contamination indicators.
10	
11	\subsection{Mantel-Haenszel DIF and ETS Classification}
12	\label{sec:mhdif}
13	
14	In educational testing, Differential Item Functioning (DIF) occurs when an item's statistical relationship to the latent trait $\theta$ differs between two groups after conditioning on ability level. An item with DIF is not merely harder for one group; it functions differently relative to what the group's overall ability would predict. The standard terminology refers to test-takers as ``examinees'' and questions as ``items.'' In our setting, examinees are LLMs and items are benchmark questions.

1	\section{Experiments}
2	\label{sec:experiments}
3	
4	We apply MH-DIF to the METABENCH response matrix~\citep{kipnis2024metabench} (5,227 models $\times$ 12,508 MMLU items~\citep{hendrycks2021mmlu}), with temporal cohorts defined by release date (2023 vs.\ 2024). Cross-benchmark validation across all six METABENCH benchmarks appears in \Cref{sec:gsm8k}.
5	
6	\subsection{Validation: DIF Detection Power}
7	\label{sec:validation}
8	
9	A power analysis using empirical MMLU IRT parameters confirms that at $N \geq 80$ per cohort, ETS~C achieves TPR of 0.68--0.80, FPR of 0.036--0.042, and AUC of 0.93--0.94 for items with $|\Delta_{\mathrm{MH}}| \geq 1.4$. Our temporal cohorts ($N_{\mathrm{ref}} = 1{,}080$, $N_{\mathrm{focal}} = 807$) far exceed this threshold.
10	
11	\subsection{Temporal Comparability: 31\% Item Instability}
12	\label{sec:temporal}
13	
14	We compare 2023 ($N = 1{,}080$) against 2024 ($N = 807$) models; 31.3\% of items receive ETS~C classification ($|\Delta_{\mathrm{MH}}| \geq 1.5$). Benjamini-Hochberg FDR correction at $q = 0.05$ removes only 3 items (31.32\% $\to$ 31.30\%), because the dual ETS threshold on effect size and significance already provides implicit multiple-testing protection.
15	
16	Three controls confirm this reflects genuine temporal change. A random split of the 2023 cohort yields only 0.18\% ETS~C items (sampling noise), and an ability-quintile comparison within the same temporal cohort yields 2.9\% (ability differences alone). A within-family comparison (Llama-2 vs.\ Llama-3) produces 61.3\% ETS~C items, elevated by large ability gaps that confound the DIF signal~\citep{holland1988mh}. The contrast between 2.9\% (ability-controlled) and 61.3\% (ability-confounded) brackets the temporal rate of 31.3\%. Crucially, the temporal cohort ability gap is negligible: Cohen's $d = -0.17$ (below the $|d| = 0.2$ small-effect threshold) with 76.4\% distributional overlap. Under strict 1:1 nearest-neighbor matching ($d \approx -0.010$, $N = 638$ per

4	\subsection{Implications for Benchmark Temporal Comparability}
5	\label{sec:disc_temporal}
6	
7	The 31\% ETS~C instability on MMLU is robust across thresholds and structural controls (\Cref{sec:structural}), and extends across all six METABENCH benchmarks (C\% $= 17.9$--$31.3\%$, 45--174$\times$ above random baselines; \Cref{tab:cross_benchmark}). Knowledge/reasoning benchmarks show higher instability (C\% $\geq 26.9\%$) than procedural ones (C\% $\leq 18.9\%$), and a Simpson's paradox in odds ratio regression ($\mathrm{OR}: 1.55 \to 0.73$ after controlling for item properties; LR $\chi^2 = 647$) confirms that item properties---not accuracy gains---drive DIF. This does not invalidate these benchmarks as ranking instruments ($\rho \approx 0.997$) but signals measurement drift across model generations.
8	
9	\subsection{Ground Truth Meta-Critique}
10	\label{sec:disc_groundtruth}
11	
12	The near-independence between DIF flags and web-overlap labels (enrichment $= 0.964$, Jaccard $= 0.206$, $\phi = 0.012$; consistent across contamination subtypes) exposes a category error: web-overlap labels identify a condition shared by nearly all MMLU items (global exposure), so evaluating a differential method against them conflates two phenomena. Item-level differential detectors require item-level differential ground truth.
13	
14	\subsection{DIF as Diagnostic Lens}
15	\label{sec:disc_diagnostic}
16	
17	The GSM1K correlation ($r = -0.478$, $p = 0.005$, $N = 33$; \Cref{sec:gsm8k}) provides exploratory evidence that DIF-flagged items capture behavioral change distinct from memorization; partial correlation ($r = -0.385$, $p = 0.027$) after controlling for accuracy confirms this is not an artifact of general model quality.
18	
19	Item characterization reinforces this: DIF-C items are harder ($d = -0.247$) and more discriminating ($d = 0.230$), distributed uniformly across subjects ($\chi^2$ $p = 0.32$). A difficulty $\times$ directi

3	
4	\subsection{Implications for Benchmark Temporal Comparability}
5	\label{sec:disc_temporal}
6	
7	The 31\% ETS~C instability on MMLU is robust across thresholds and structural controls (\Cref{sec:structural}), and extends across all six METABENCH benchmarks (C\% $= 17.9$--$31.3\%$, 45--174$\times$ above random baselines; \Cref{tab:cross_benchmark}). Knowledge/reasoning benchmarks show higher instability (C\% $\geq 26.9\%$) than procedural ones (C\% $\leq 18.9\%$), and the Simpson's paradox in odds ratio regression (\Cref{sec:temporal}) confirms item properties---not accuracy gains---drive DIF. This does not invalidate these benchmarks as ranking instruments ($\rho \approx 0.997$) but signals measurement drift across model generations.
8	
9	\subsection{Ground Truth Meta-Critique}
10	\label{sec:disc_groundtruth}
11	
12	The near-independence between DIF flags and web-overlap labels (enrichment $= 0.964$, Jaccard $= 0.206$, $\phi = 0.012$; consistent across contamination subtypes) exposes a category error: web-overlap labels identify a condition shared by nearly all MMLU items (global exposure), so evaluating a differential method against them conflates two phenomena. Item-level differential detectors require item-level differential ground truth.
13	
14	\subsection{DIF as Diagnostic Lens}
15	\label{sec:disc_diagnostic}
16	
17	The GSM1K correlation ($r = -0.478$, $p = 0.005$, $N = 33$; \Cref{sec:gsm8k}) provides exploratory evidence that DIF-flagged items capture behavioral change distinct from memorization; partial correlation ($r = -0.385$, $p = 0.027$) after controlling for accuracy confirms this is not an artifact of general model quality.
18	
19	Item characterization reinforces this: DIF-C items are harder ($d = -0.247$) and more discriminating ($d = 0.230$), distributed uniformly across subjects ($\chi^2$ $p = 0.32$). A difficulty $\times$ direction interaction ($\rho = -0.597$, $p < 0.001$) shows capability gains

2	\label{sec:conclusion}
3	
4	Applying MH-DIF to six METABENCH benchmarks (27,125 items, 5,227 models), we find 17.9--31.3\% temporal item instability (ETS~C)---knowledge/reasoning benchmarks more affected than procedural ones, each 45--174$\times$ above random baselines. A Simpson's paradox confirms item properties, not accuracy gains, drive DIF. Web-overlap labels show near-independence with DIF flags (enrichment $\approx 0.96$); our semi-synthetic framework ($\Delta\mathrm{FPR} = 0.000$, $\Delta\mathrm{TPR} = {+}0.508$) provides controlled validation. DIF-flagged items concentrate discriminative information ($z = -8\sigma$ to $-49\sigma$ vs.\ random removal) and exhibit a difficulty--direction interaction ($\rho = -0.597$): gains on hard items, erosion on easy ones. DIF is a diagnostic lens, not a quality filter; LLM benchmarks need psychometric monitoring alongside score reporting.

22	In educational testing, DIF compares demographic groups to detect items that disadvantage a subgroup---a fairness diagnostic~\citep{holland1988mh,clauser1998dif}. Transplanting this to LLM evaluation redefines the grouping variable from demographic to temporal: a DIF-flagged item no longer signals potential bias but that the item's relationship to overall ability has shifted across model generations. The statistical machinery (MH odds ratios, ETS classification, cross-subject matching) transfers unchanged, requiring only a binary response matrix and cohort labels---no IRT model fitting or training data access needed.
23	
24	\subsection{Recommended DIF Audit Protocol}
25	\label{sec:disc_protocol}
26	
27	These findings motivate a benchmark maintenance protocol: (1)~MH-DIF audits whenever $\geq 500$ new models accumulate (or quarterly), using cross-subject matching (\Cref{sec:semisynthetic}); (2)~C\% $> 20\%$ triggers item review---consecutively flagged items are labeled ``unstable,'' while items that flip between flagged and unflagged across audits are tagged ``volatile'' (stochastic sensitivity, not systematic drift); (3)~graduated responses: flag-and-annotate, item rotation, or weighted scoring. MMLU's C\% $= 31.3\%$ already exceeds this threshold; the 3{,}915 ETS~C items distribute uniformly across subjects ($\chi^2$ $p = 0.32$), suggesting benchmark-wide annotation rather than targeted subject removal.

15	We apply classical MH-DIF with ETS classification to the full METABENCH response matrix (5,227 models $\times$ 12,508 MMLU items), to our knowledge, the largest-scale DIF analysis on LLM benchmarks. This psychometric approach complements concurrent work on anchor-item calibration for score comparability~\citep{habba2026growingpains} and addresses the fragility of existing contamination detectors under post-training perturbation~\citep{wang2026fragility}. Semi-synthetic injection experiments confirm that MH-DIF is sensitive to differential item behavior when present ($\Delta\mathrm{TPR} = {+}0.508$ at exploitation rate $p = 0.5$), and our cross-subject matching protocol eliminates false positive inflation ($\Delta\mathrm{FPR} = 0.000$). Three structural controls (matched-ability quintile analysis, IRT $\theta$-conditioning, and within-subject pre-checks) confirm that the 31\% temporal instability cannot be attributed to methodological artifacts, establishing it as a robust empirical finding about LLM benchmark measurement properties, replicated across all six METABENCH benchmarks (\Cref{sec:gsm8k}). Crucially, MH-DIF detects \emph{that} items function differently across cohorts, not \emph{why}---the differential signal may reflect contamination, capability change, training methodology shifts, or interactions among these factors.
16	
17	MMLU's 12,508 items provide sufficient measurement redundancy that removing nearly a third does not alter rank order ($\rho \approx 0.997$). DIF should therefore be understood as a diagnostic lens rather than a quality filter. DIF-flagged items concentrate discriminative signal: removing them degrades ranking discriminability more than random removal ($z = -8\sigma$ to $-49\sigma$ across 21 conditions). Model families show distinctive DIF profiles: Llama-3 derivatives gain a median of ${+}53$ rank positions under stable-item evaluation, while Mistral-based models lose a median of $35$; 25\% of models shift by $|\Delta\mathrm{Ran

4	Applying MH-DIF to six METABENCH benchmarks (27,125 items, 5,227 models), we find 17.9--31.3\% temporal item instability (ETS~C), with knowledge/reasoning benchmarks more affected than procedural ones. A Simpson's paradox confirms item properties, not accuracy gains, drive DIF. Web-overlap labels are near-independent of DIF flags (enrichment $\approx 0.96$); our semi-synthetic framework validates detection power with zero FPR inflation. DIF-flagged items concentrate discriminative information ($z = -8\sigma$ to $-49\sigma$) and exhibit a difficulty--direction interaction ($\rho = -0.597$): gains on hard items, erosion on easy ones. LLM benchmarks need psychometric monitoring alongside score reporting.

17	MMLU's 12,508 items provide sufficient measurement redundancy that removing nearly a third does not alter rank order ($\rho \approx 0.997$). DIF should therefore be understood as a diagnostic lens rather than a quality filter. DIF-flagged items concentrate discriminative signal: removing them degrades ranking discriminability more than random removal ($z = -8\sigma$ to $-49\sigma$ across 21 conditions). Model families show distinctive DIF profiles: Llama-3 derivatives gain a median of ${+}53$ rank positions under stable-item evaluation, while Mistral-based models lose a median of $35$; 25\% of models shift by $|\Delta\mathrm{Rank}| \geq 100$.

19	The MH-DIF procedure is well-established in psychometrics~\citep{holland1988mh,clauser1998dif}; the cross-subject matching strategy has psychometric precedent~\citep{nandakumar1993dif}. Our contributions are empirical and methodological, not algorithmic:

[Director 指令] [Patch] plan_031 temporal granularity 整合 — 仅 MMLU 半年数据

Reviewer 深度审查了 plan_031 数据，给出明确使用边界。新增一个小段落：

**§4 新增 temporal granularity robustness check（1-2 句）**：
- 核心数据：MMLU 2023-H2 vs 2024-H1 (6-month window) C%=34.35%, random=0.19%, enrichment 181×
- **安全表述**（Reviewer 审定）："Even within a 6-month window (2023-H2 vs 2024-H1), DIF remains substantial (C%=34.35%, 181× above random baseline), indicating that the signal is not an artifact of the coarse annual split."
- **禁止**说"DIF 在 6 个月内饱和"或任何趋势/曲线相关的 claim（只有 2 个时间点，无法建立趋势）
- TruthfulQA 半年（C%=31.33%, 51× enrichment）可作辅助提及
- HellaSwag 半年**不进正文**（enrichment 仅 3.5×，signal-to-noise 太差）
- 放在 cross-benchmark validation (§4.6) 之后或作为 §4 的最后一个 robustness paragraph

这次不用验证引用。注意保持 8 页限制。

[Director 指令] [Patch] 调研后的 3 项写作优化 — 推 4.0 的关键修改

### P11: ΔFPR=0.000 形式化为 Proposition

Best tier 原话："If this is an algebraic guarantee (which it appears to be), state it as a theorem."

在 Method 或 §4 中添加一个 Proposition（不必写完整证明，proof sketch 即可）：

**Proposition 1.** *Under cross-subject matching, the matching variable $M_i$ for examinee $i$ on focal subject $s$ is computed from items outside $s$. Since the studied item belongs to $s$, it does not contribute to $M_i$. Therefore, ΔFPR = 0 holds by construction for any non-zero DIF effect size.*

这把一个经验观察升级为方法论贡献，增加 novelty 权重。

### P12: Related Work 扩展 — 新发现的关键引用

调研发现 3 篇必须引用的新论文：

1. **"Benchmark Health Index: A Systematic Framework for Benchmarking the Benchmarks of LLMs"** (2026, arXiv:2602.11674) — 与我们最相关的工作。他们提出 benchmark 质量评估框架，我们做 temporal measurement invariance。**定位**：BHI 评估静态 benchmark 质量，我们检测 temporal DIF——互补而非竞争。在 Related Work 添加。

2. **"Lost in Benchmarks? Rethinking LLM Benchmarking with Item Response Theory"** (PSN-IRT, AAAI 2026 Oral, arXiv:2505.15055) — 用 IRT 估计 item parameters 和 model ability。**定位**：他们用 IRT 改进 scoring，我们用 DIF 检测 measurement invariance violation。互补。

3. **"Finding Words Associated with DIF: Predicting DIF using LLMs and Explainable AI"** (Maeda 2025, arXiv:2502.07017) — 用 LLM 预测哪些 item 词汇与 DIF 相关。**定位**：他们做 DIF 预测（which words cause DIF），我们做 DIF 检测（which items show DIF across LLM cohorts）。

Related Work 中增加一个 "Benchmark Quality Assessment" 小段落（2-3 句），涵盖这三篇。同时 address Worst tier 的 "10 citations in main text insufficient" 批评。

### P13: Negative Results 叙事重组

当前 6 个 negative 结果散落在各处。建议在 §4 或 §5 中显式组织为 "Systematic Confound Elimination"（一个小段落）：

"We systematically tested and ruled out six alternative explanations for the observed temporal DIF: ability confounding (plan_027: matched C%=28.9%), model family inflation (plan_022: independence confirmed), IRT theta conditioning (plan_012), within-subject effects (plan_014), downstream ranking impact at aggregate level (plan_017: ρ=0.997), and local item dependence (plan_013: r=0.09, null). The persistence of ~31% C% across all controls confirms the signal reflects genuine item-level differential functioning."

这把 6 个 "failures" 变成 "thorough controls" 叙事——三档审稿已经 praise 了我们的 controls，这样更显式地强化。

这次不验证引用。注意 8 页限制——如果空间紧张，优先 P11 (theorem) > P12 (related work) > P13 (negatives narrative)。

1	\section{Method}
2	\label{sec:method}
3	
4	We adopt Differential Item Functioning (DIF) analysis from educational measurement to assess whether individual benchmark items behave consistently across groups of LLMs. The procedure requires only a binary response matrix and group labels, with no access to model internals or training data. Below we define the data, the statistical test, the cohort designs, and a semi-synthetic validation framework.
5	
6	\subsection{Data}
7	\label{sec:data}
8	
9	The primary dataset is the METABENCH response matrix~\citep{kipnis2024metabench}, which records binary outcomes (1~=~correct, 0~=~incorrect) for 5,227 models evaluated on 12,508 MMLU items~\citep{hendrycks2021mmlu}. Models span release dates from 2023 to 2024, drawn from the Open LLM Leaderboard. MMLU covers 57 subjects grouped into five broad domains (STEM, Humanities, Social Sciences, Other, and a mixed category). We supplement the response matrix with the web-overlap contamination labels of \citet{li2024contamination}, which classify 9,229 of 12,508 items (73.8\% coverage) as ``contaminated'' or ``clean'' based on verbatim matches in publicly accessible web corpora. These labels serve as an external reference for evaluating the relationship between DIF flags and existing contamination indicators.

11	\subsection{Mantel-Haenszel DIF and ETS Classification}
12	\label{sec:mhdif}
13	
14	In educational testing, Differential Item Functioning (DIF) occurs when an item's statistical relationship to the latent trait $\theta$ differs between two groups after conditioning on ability level. An item with DIF is not merely harder for one group; it functions differently relative to what the group's overall ability would predict. The standard terminology refers to test-takers as ``examinees'' and questions as ``items.'' In our setting, examinees are LLMs and items are benchmark questions.

3	
4	\paragraph{Contamination Detection.}
5	A growing family of methods detects benchmark contamination through model behavior or training data analysis. Membership inference approaches estimate whether a model has seen specific items during training: Min-K\% \citep{shi2024mink} and Min-K\%++ \citep{zhang2024minkpp} use token-level log-likelihood statistics, while Time Travel \citep{golchin2024timetravel} probes models with temporal cues. Performance-based detectors identify contamination through statistical anomalies: ConStat \citep{dekoninck2024constat} tests performance gaps between original and perturbed items, DVD \citep{liang2026dvd} uses distributional verification, and Self-Critique \citep{tao2026selfcritique} employs model self-evaluation. \citet{balloccu2024leak} provide a broader taxonomy of leakage detection strategies. These methods share a common validation practice: they verify detection accuracy against web-overlap or n-gram labels \citep{li2024contamination} that classify items based on verbatim matches in publicly accessible corpora. Such labels measure \emph{global exposure} (whether an item exists in training data) rather than \emph{differential item functioning} (whether an item behaves differently across model cohorts). This global-vs-differential distinction motivates our ground truth analysis (Claim~2, \Cref{sec:groundtruth}). Work on LLM memorization \citep{carlini2022quantifying, tirumala2022memorization} establishes that memorization depends on data frequency and model scale, reinforcing the distinction between global exposure and differential behavior. \citet{wang2026fragility} show that existing contamination detectors are fragile under reinforcement learning, further motivating behavioral approaches grounded in psychometric theory.

1	\section{Experiments}
2	\label{sec:experiments}
3	
4	We apply MH-DIF to the METABENCH response matrix~\citep{kipnis2024metabench} (5,227 models $\times$ 12,508 MMLU items~\citep{hendrycks2021mmlu}), with temporal cohorts defined by release date (2023 vs.\ 2024). Cross-benchmark validation across all six METABENCH benchmarks appears in \Cref{sec:gsm8k}.
5	
6	\subsection{Validation: DIF Detection Power}
7	\label{sec:validation}
8	
9	A power analysis using empirical MMLU IRT parameters confirms that at $N \geq 80$ per cohort, ETS~C achieves TPR of 0.68--0.80, FPR of 0.036--0.042, and AUC of 0.93--0.94 for items with $|\Delta_{\mathrm{MH}}| \geq 1.4$. Our temporal cohorts ($N_{\mathrm{ref}} = 1{,}080$, $N_{\mathrm{focal}} = 807$) far exceed this threshold.
10	
11	\subsection{Temporal Comparability: 31\% Item Instability}
12	\label{sec:temporal}
13	
14	We compare 2023 ($N = 1{,}080$) against 2024 ($N = 807$) models; 31.3\% of items receive ETS~C classification ($|\Delta_{\mathrm{MH}}| \geq 1.5$). Benjamini-Hochberg FDR correction at $q = 0.05$ removes only 3 items (31.32\% $\to$ 31.30\%), because the dual ETS threshold on effect size and significance already provides implicit multiple-testing protection.
15	
16	Three controls confirm this reflects genuine temporal change. A random split of the 2023 cohort yields only 0.18\% ETS~C items (sampling noise), and an ability-quintile comparison within the same temporal cohort yields 2.9\% (ability differences alone). A within-family comparison (Llama-2 vs.\ Llama-3) produces 61.3\% ETS~C items, elevated by large ability gaps that confound the DIF signal~\citep{holland1988mh}. The contrast between 2.9\% (ability-controlled) and 61.3\% (ability-confounded) brackets the temporal rate of 31.3\%. Crucially, the temporal cohort ability gap is negligible: Cohen's $d = -0.17$ (below the $|d| = 0.2$ small-effect threshold) with 76.4\% distributional overlap. Under strict 1:1 nearest-neighbor matching ($d \approx -0.010$, $N = 638$ per
