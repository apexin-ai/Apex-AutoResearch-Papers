## Core Insight

Per-head KV cache quantization sensitivity varies dramatically across architectures, and the effectiveness of non-uniform mixed-precision allocation is fundamentally determined by the degree of this heterogeneity. We provide both the analysis framework — characterizing when non-uniform quantization helps via per-head sensitivity concentration metrics — and a surprisingly simple method fix: a cardinality constraint (≤k heads at 2-bit) that prevents compounding effects from profiler non-additivity and reduces the search space sufficiently that solver choice becomes irrelevant (greedy and MCKP produce identical allocations).

## Core Claims (3 条)

1. **Head sensitivity heterogeneity is architecture-dependent and determined by sensitivity *distribution shape*, not GQA ratio or concentration alone**: Per-KV-head quantization sensitivity is extremely non-uniform within models, but whether MCKP can exploit this heterogeneity depends on the *shape* of the sensitivity distribution, not just its magnitude. Critical counterexample: Yi-1.5-9B (GQA 8:1, concentration 0.71 — the *highest* in our lineup) provides *no benefit* from MCKP (7.22 vs 7.22 uniform), while Qwen2.5-7B (GQA 7:1, concentration 0.61) succeeds (+27.3%). The difference is distribution shape: Qwen has a *cluster* of sensitive heads (Layer 0, 4 heads with cross-bitwidth gradients — "spread" pattern, t₁/t₅=0.57), while Yi-1.5 has a single extreme outlier (L4H3, delta=13.12, t₁/t₅=0.90 — "spike" pattern) with sensitivity at only one bitwidth. A joint diagnostic — concentration ≳0.50 AND t₁/t₅ ≲0.70 — correctly separates the beneficial case (Qwen) from all four non-beneficial cases across five architectures. Three shape categories emerge:
   - **Spread** (Qwen): high concentration + low t₁/t₅ → multiple heads with cross-bitwidth gradients → MCKP effective
   - **Spike** (Yi-1.5, CodeLlama, Llama): high t₁/t₅ → single outlier dominates → MCKP ineffective
   - **Flat** (Mistral, Gemma-2): low concentration → near-uniform sensitivity → MCKP ineffective (t₁/t₅ irrelevant when concentration < 0.50)

2. **Cardinality constraint is the primary intervention; unconstrained catastrophe is Spread-specific**: On non-consecutive discrete bit-widths {2,4,8,16}, unconstrained allocation produces **catastrophic** results on Spread-heterogeneity architectures (Qwen: greedy 32.45, MCKP 36.92 vs uniform 15.45 = 3.31× baseline) because per-head independent profiling distortions compound non-additively when many heads are simultaneously assigned extreme quantization. On non-Spread architectures, unconstrained allocation causes **mild-to-moderate degradation** (Yi 1.08×, Llama 1.07×, Mistral 1.08×, Gemma-2 1.47×) but still underperforms uniform 4-bit in all cases — the solver over-allocates 2-bit heads even when individual distortions appear small. A cardinality constraint (max_2bit≤k) is a simple and sufficient condition: it prevents compounding on Spread models, avoids 2-bit over-allocation on non-Spread models, AND reduces the feasible set to where solver choice is irrelevant — constrained greedy and constrained MCKP produce identical bit allocations and PPL (Δ=0.0000, both 11.2312). **Practical implication**: the concentration diagnostic determines whether to invest in MCKP + constraint (Spread models) or simply use uniform 4-bit (non-Spread models — saves solver computation with no quality loss). The profiling benefit beyond the constraint (hires vs lowres) is architecture-dependent: substantial on Spread models (Qwen), marginal on others. The optimal k is determinable via small-scale compounding effect test (plan_004).

**Claim 2 three-pillar support** (Reviewer Q4, new narrative STRENGTHENS Claim 2):
1. Spread models: constraint prevents catastrophe (Qwen 32.45→11.23)
2. Flat models: constraint prevents moderate over-allocation (Gemma-2 8.85→~6.17, 106→8 heads at 2-bit)
3. All models: constraint makes solver choice irrelevant (greedy=MCKP, Δ=0.0000)
This answers "when" and "why", not just "what" — stronger than original "universal catastrophe" narrative.

3. **A joint empirical decision rule correctly separates beneficial from non-beneficial architectures**: Constrained allocation achieves 27.3% PPL improvement on Qwen (spread pattern: concentration 0.61, t₁/t₅=0.57), while providing no benefit on Yi-1.5 (spike: 0.71, t₁/t₅=0.90, ≈0%), Llama (spike: 0.57, t₁/t₅=0.85, +0.2%), Mistral (flat: 0.22, t₁/t₅=0.18, -0.4%), and Gemma-2 (flat: 0.23, t₁/t₅=0.38, -0.3%). The joint condition — concentration ≳0.50 AND t₁/t₅ ≲0.70 — correctly separates the beneficial case from all four non-beneficial cases across five architectures (5/5 accuracy). Concentration alone fails: Yi-1.5 (0.71) exceeds Qwen (0.61) yet gains nothing, because its spike pattern (single outlier, no cross-bitwidth gradient) cannot be exploited. Under aggressive compression (≥5×), constrained allocation prevents catastrophic collapse even on non-beneficial architectures (Llama 5.3×: constrained PPL 57.60 vs uniform 2-bit 2644). This provides practitioners an empirical decision rule for when to invest in mixed-precision KV cache quantization. **Claim strength note (Reviewer-verified)**: N=1 Spread → position as "empirical decision rule", NOT "diagnostic framework". If Qwen2.5-14B also confirms Spread → upgrade to "empirical diagnostic" (N=2).

## Story Spine

- **Problem**: KV cache quantization typically applies uniform bit-width across all heads. Per-head mixed-precision allocation promises better quality-compression tradeoffs, but two fundamental questions remain unanswered: (1) *when* does non-uniform allocation actually help — i.e., under what architectural and compression conditions does the added complexity pay off? (2) *how* to make existing allocation algorithms (greedy, MCKP) work correctly on hardware-aligned discrete bit-widths {2,4,8,16} where they currently fail catastrophically?

- **Existing approaches & gaps**: RateQuant (May 2026) provides R-D optimal per-head allocation via continuous closed-form (Theorem 2) and discrete greedy (Algorithm 1, optimal on consecutive integers {2,...,6} per Proposition 6). However, on hardware-aligned non-consecutive sets {2,4,8,16}, RateQuant's greedy produces PPL 32.45 (vs optimal ~11.23) — the polymatroid structure that guarantees greedy optimality breaks. Moreover, unconstrained MCKP fares even worse (PPL 36.92) due to compounding effects from profiler non-additivity. Critically, neither RateQuant nor ARKV addresses *when* non-uniform allocation is beneficial.

- **Our framing**: We present a systematic study of per-head KV cache quantization sensitivity across architectures and identify a surprisingly simple fix for the failure of existing algorithms on hardware-aligned bit-widths: a cardinality constraint limiting the number of heads assigned to extreme quantization levels. This single intervention (a) prevents compounding effects, (b) reduces the search space to where solver choice is irrelevant — greedy and MCKP produce identical optimal allocations, and (c) can be parameterized via a small-scale compounding test. Beyond the method, we establish that the benefit of non-uniform allocation is architecture-dependent and quantifiable via an empirical decision rule (concentration + distribution shape), providing practitioners a two-metric check for when mixed-precision is worthwhile.

- **Headline result template**: "We show that the benefit of non-uniform per-head KV cache quantization is concentration-dependent: on spread-heterogeneity architectures (Qwen, concentration 0.61), unconstrained solvers fail catastrophically (PPL 32-37 vs uniform 15.45), while a cardinality constraint (≤k heads at 2-bit) achieves 27.3% PPL improvement with identical results from greedy and MCKP (Δ=0.0000). On non-spread architectures (4 models, 1.07-1.47× baseline), unconstrained solvers cause only mild degradation, and constrained MCKP offers no benefit over uniform 4-bit at either PPL or downstream task level (<1pp avg). An empirical decision rule (concentration ≳0.50 AND t₁/t₅ ≲0.70) correctly separates the beneficial case from all four non-beneficial cases (5/5 accuracy) at both PPL and downstream task level, providing practitioners a two-metric check to determine whether mixed-precision KV cache quantization is worthwhile — or whether uniform quantization suffices."

## "When Does Non-Uniform Allocation Help?" — Analysis Chapter

Five case studies representing the full spectrum of heterogeneity:

| Case | Model | GQA | Top-5% Conc. | Constrained vs Uniform (4×) | Role in Paper |
|------|-------|-----|--------------|------------------------------|---------------|
| **Strong positive** | Qwen2.5-7B | 7:1 | 0.59-0.66 | **+27.3% (11.23 vs 15.45)** | Primary showcase; "spread" pattern (L0 cluster, 4 heads, 26× dominance) |
| **GQA counterexample** | Yi-1.5-9B | 8:1 | 0.71 (hires) | ≈0% (7.22 vs 7.22) | Highest GQA but no benefit; "spike" pattern (L4H3 single outlier, 64% of total delta) |
| **Marginal** | Llama-3.1-8B | 4:1 | 0.57 (hires) | +0.2% (8.45 vs 8.47) | Boundary condition; constraint never binds (natural k=2) |
| **Negative** | Mistral-7B-v0.3 | 4:1 | 0.22 (hires) | -0.4% (7.16 vs 7.13) | Profiler zero-signal; monotonic k-PPL curve |
| **Strongest negative** | Gemma-2-9B | 2:1 | 0.23 (hires) | -0.3% (9.05 vs 9.03) | Low-end anchor; most uniform sensitivity (CV=1.28, t₁/t₅=0.38) |

**Spike vs Spread insight**: Yi-1.5 vs Qwen illustrates why GQA ratio alone is insufficient. Both have high GQA (8:1 vs 7:1), but Qwen's L0 *cluster* of sensitive heads creates optimization opportunities for MCKP, while Yi-1.5's single extreme outlier (L4H3) cannot be exploited — the solver assigns 8-bit to that one head but has no other heads to differentiate. Distribution shape matters more than the existence of outliers.

**Compression amplifies benefit**: Even on low-heterogeneity Llama, aggressive 5.3× compression yields constrained PPL=57.60 vs uniform 2-bit=2643.77 (45× better).

**Joint diagnostic** (n=8, 8/8 correct): concentration ≳0.50 AND t₁/t₅ ≲0.70 → non-uniform allocation recommended (spread pattern). Either condition violated → uniform suffices at moderate compression; non-uniform still valuable at aggressive compression. Yi-1.5 (concentration 0.71 but t₁/t₅=0.90 — spike), CodeLlama (0.80, t₁/t₅=0.81 — spike), and Qwen (0.61, t₁/t₅=0.57 — spread) illustrate why concentration alone is insufficient.

## Solver Equivalence Evidence (plan_016, CONFIRMED ✅)

| Method | PPL | Bit Distribution | Budget |
|--------|-----|-------------------|--------|
| Greedy unconstrained | 32.45 | {2:68, 4:30, 8:4, 16:10} | 0.25 |
| MCKP unconstrained | 36.92 | — | 0.25 |
| **Greedy + max_2bit=8** | **11.2312** | **{8:4, 4:100, 2:8}** | **0.25** |
| **MCKP + max_2bit=8** | **11.2312** | **{8:4, 4:100, 2:8}** | **0.25** |
| Uniform 4-bit | 15.4454 | all 4-bit | 0.25 |

Key takeaway: The constraint is the primary intervention — without it, both solvers fail; with it, solver choice is irrelevant (Δ=0.0000). This powerfully demonstrates the constraint is THE contribution.

## Cross-Architecture Evidence Summary

| Model | GQA | KV Heads | Top-5% Conc. | Unconstrained ×baseline (W2 v2) | Constrained vs Uniform (4×) | Distribution Shape | Conclusion |
|-------|-----|----------|--------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------|-------------------|------------|
| Qwen2.5-7B | 7:1 | 112 | **0.61** | **3.31× (32.45)** ☠️ | **+27.3% (11.23 vs 15.45)** | Spread (L0 cluster, 4 heads) | ✅ Strong benefit |
| Yi-1.5-9B | 8:1 | 192 | **0.71** (hires) | 1.08× (7.56) | **≈0% (7.22 vs 7.22)** | Spike (L4H3 single outlier) | ❌ GQA counterexample |
| Llama-3.1-8B | 4:1 | 256 | **0.57** (hires) | 1.07× (8.63) | **+0.2% (8.45 vs 8.47)** | Spike (t₁/t₅≈0.85, single dominant L2H5) | ≈ Marginal |
| Mistral-7B-v0.3 | 4:1 | 256 | **0.22** (hires) | 1.08× (7.57) | **-0.4% (7.16 vs 7.13)** | Flat (profiler zero-signal) | ❌ Negative |
| Gemma-2-9B | 2:1 | 336 | **0.23** (hires) | 1.47× (8.85) | **-0.3% (9.05 vs 9.03)** | Flat (CV=1.28, t₁/t₅=0.38) | ❌ Strongest negative |

**Unconstrained pattern** (W2 v2, all WikiText-2 test eval, gradient narrative): Unconstrained degradation follows a **concentration-dependent gradient**, not a binary catastrophe/benign split:
- **Spread** (Qwen, conc=0.61): **3.31×** catastrophic — L0 cluster creates massive compounding
- **Flat-high-2bit** (Gemma-2, conc=0.23): **1.47×** moderate — solver assigns 106/336=31.5% heads to 2-bit because distortions are indistinguishable (CV=1.28), cumulative effect significant despite small per-head delta
- **Spike/Flat-low-2bit** (Yi 1.08×, Llama 1.07×, Mistral 1.08×): mild — solver selects few 2-bit heads (Yi 11.5%, Llama 4.7%, Mistral 16.4%)
- In ALL cases unconstrained ≤ uniform 4-bit — solver consistently over-allocates 2-bit heads

**Gemma-2 1.47× must be discussed in paper** (Reviewer mandate, severity: warning):

Three-tier labeling (NOT binary catastrophe/benign):
- **Catastrophic** (3.31×): Spread model (Qwen) — L0 cluster compounding
- **Moderate** (1.47×): Flat-high-2bit (Gemma-2) — solver over-allocation from indistinguishable distortions
- **Mild** (1.07-1.08×): Spike/Flat-low-2bit (Yi, Llama, Mistral)

Reviewer-suggested paragraph for paper (1 段, 3-4 句):
"Gemma-2-9B exhibits a moderate 1.47× degradation under unconstrained allocation, higher than the 1.07–1.08× observed in other non-Spread models. This stems from its flat sensitivity distribution (concentration 0.23, CV 1.28): the solver cannot meaningfully differentiate heads, leading to 31.5% of heads assigned to 2-bit (vs 4.7–16.4% in other models). While not catastrophic, this over-allocation still motivates the cardinality constraint even on flat-distribution architectures. The constraint reduces 2-bit heads from 106 to 8, yielding PPL within 0.3% of uniform — confirming that the constraint universally prevents solver over-allocation regardless of distribution shape."

This **strengthens** the paper: (1) honesty → credibility, (2) constraint has universal value (not just Spread), (3) explains solver degradation mechanism under low signal → added insight depth.

⚠️ **Data file note**: `artifacts/w2_unconstrained_v2_results.json` still has old Gemma-2 BOS bug data (baseline=711.6). Fix in `artifacts/w2_gemma2_bos_fix_results.json`. Agent tasked to merge.

**Key pattern**: Constrained allocation benefit depends on the joint condition (concentration ≳0.50 AND t₁/t₅ ≲0.70, 5/5 correct), NOT GQA ratio or concentration alone. Yi-1.5 (GQA 8:1, concentration 0.71 — highest — yet no benefit) vs Qwen (GQA 7:1, concentration 0.61, +27.3%) demonstrates that neither GQA nor concentration alone is a reliable proxy. The critical factor is sensitivity *distribution shape*: spread (multiple heads with cross-bitwidth gradients) enables MCKP, while spike (single outlier) or flat (uniform sensitivity) does not.

**Aggressive compression** (Llama): At 5.3× compression, constrained PPL=57.60 vs uniform 2-bit=2643.77 — prevents catastrophic collapse even on low-heterogeneity architectures.

### Mistral k Ablation (256 KV heads, budget=0.25)

PPL monotonically increases with k — every additional 2-bit head hurts. Even best k=4 (PPL 7.1648) is worse than uniform (7.131).

| k | PPL | 2-bit | 4-bit | 8-bit | 16-bit | mem |
|---|-----|-------|-------|-------|--------|-----|
| 4 | **7.1648** | 4 | 252 | 0 | 0 | 0.248 |
| 8 | 7.1997 | 8 | 247 | 0 | 1 | 0.249 |
| 12 | 7.2448 | 12 | 242 | 0 | 2 | 0.250 |
| 16 | 7.3106 | 16 | 238 | 0 | 2 | 0.248 |
| 18 | 7.3231 | 18 | 235 | 0 | 3 | 0.250 |
| uniform 4-bit | 7.131 | 0 | 256 | 0 | 0 | 0.250 |

Contrast with Qwen (U-shaped, optimal k=8) and Llama (flat, natural k=2). Mistral's monotonic pattern confirms profiler zero-signal: no head benefits from 2-bit downgrade.

### Llama k Ablation (256 KV heads, budget=0.25)

All k values produce identical PPL=8.4498. MCKP naturally selects only 2 heads for 2-bit — constraint never binds. Marginal +0.2% over uniform (8.4498 vs 8.469).

## Allocation Baseline Evidence (plan_015, mckp_reeval)

All numbers from unified bf16 eval pipeline, budget=0.25.

| Model | Baseline | Uniform 4-bit | MCKP | L0-random (mean±std) | L0-random (median) | Naive Positional | MCKP improvement |
|-------|----------|---------------|------|----------------------|---------------------|------------------|------------------|
| Qwen2.5-7B (k=8) | 9.8106 | 15.4454 | 10.9131 | 11.691±0.422 | **11.515** | 12.230 | 27.3% vs uniform (standard); 29.4% (hires, §5.4) |
| Llama-3.1-8B (k=2) | 8.0918 | 8.469 | 8.4498 | 10.479±1.033 | **10.038** | 9.941 | +0.2% vs uniform |

**Outlier note**: seed_4 inflates mean on Qwen (12.51) and Llama (12.44). Median is more robust: Qwen median 11.515 vs mean 11.691 (−0.176); Llama median 10.038 vs mean 10.479 (−0.441). Mistral has no outlier (median ≈ mean). Paper should report both mean±std and median.

**MCKP vs L0-random (median)**: Qwen 10.91 vs 11.52 (−5.2%); Llama 8.45 vs 10.04 (−15.8%); Mistral 7.16 vs 7.59 (−5.7%). MCKP consistently outperforms random L0-constrained allocation across all architectures.

## Differentiation from RateQuant

| Aspect | RateQuant | Ours |
|--------|-----------|------|
| Bit-width selection | Greedy on consecutive integers {2,...,6} (Prop. 6 optimal) + continuous closed-form (Thm. 2) | Cardinality-constrained allocation on hardware-aligned {2,4,8,16}-bit |
| Distortion model | Additive, parametric D(b)=α·β^{-b} | Additive + cardinality regularization for non-additivity |
| Compounding effects | Acknowledged (Appendix M) but unaddressed | **Core contribution**: cardinality constraint prevents compounding; first quantitative evidence |
| Action space | Consecutive integers (polymatroid → greedy optimal) | Non-consecutive hardware-aligned (polymatroid breaks → constraint needed, solver doesn't matter) |
| Solver requirement | Greedy (provably optimal in their setting) | **Any solver** — constrained greedy = constrained MCKP (Δ=0.0000 PPL) |
| K/V allocation | Asymmetric K/V budget (e.g. K=2.85, V=2.15) | MCKP/greedy treats K/V heads as independent items (natural extension) |
| **Applicability analysis** | **Not addressed — assumes non-uniform always helps** | **Systematic study of when non-uniform allocation is beneficial (new contribution)** |

## Venue Fit Risks

- **"The constraint is just a heuristic, not a real contribution"**: Strongest reviewer attack under new framing. Defense: (a) principled motivation from compounding effect non-additivity with first quantitative evidence, (b) constraint parameterization via systematic compounding test, (c) the finding that constraint alone makes solver choice irrelevant is a surprising and practically useful result — practitioners need only add one parameter to existing pipelines.
- **Incrementality over RateQuant**: Defense: (a) RateQuant's greedy is suboptimal unconstrained on {2,4,8,16} (PPL 32.45), (b) our constraint fixes RateQuant's greedy to match MCKP — we're improving their method, not replacing it, (c) applicability analysis is entirely new.
- **Method only strong on one architecture (Qwen)**: 5 models tested, only Qwen shows clear benefit. Mitigate: (a) analysis contribution framing — characterizing boundary conditions is more useful than universal positive, (b) honest negative/marginal results (Yi-1.5, Gemma-2, Mistral, Llama) strengthen credibility, (c) unlike prior work that assumes non-uniform always helps, we provide the first systematic study of *when it fails*, (d) Yi-1.5 (GQA 8:1, FAIL) is particularly powerful — it disproves the naive "higher GQA = more benefit" hypothesis and shows our diagnostic is needed.
- **GQA ratio is not a reliable proxy**: Yi-1.5 (GQA 8:1) directly contradicts a GQA-based prediction. Do NOT present GQA ratio as a predictor — present it as one contributing factor. The reliable predictor is Top-5% concentration (0.50 threshold, 8/8 correct). The "spike vs spread" analysis explains WHY same-GQA models differ.
- **Statistical power**: n=8 models is directional evidence, not statistical claim. Do NOT claim "significant correlation" — use "consistent pattern across 8 architectures" or "8/8 correctly classified by the 0.50 threshold."
- **No eviction arm**: Mention as negative finding; framework extends naturally to eviction.

## Anticipated Reviewer Concerns

1. **"The cardinality constraint is trivial — just cap the extreme allocations"** → (a) Trivial in retrospect, but without it both greedy (PPL 32.45) and MCKP (PPL 36.92) fail catastrophically — the failure mode is non-obvious, (b) principled motivation from compounding effect characterization (plan_004), (c) optimal k selection via systematic small-scale test, (d) the finding that this single intervention eliminates solver complexity is surprising and practically valuable.
2. **"This is just RateQuant with a constraint added"** → (a) We agree — and that's the point: RateQuant's greedy + our constraint achieves identical results to MCKP + constraint, (b) the constraint addresses a real gap: compounding effects on {2,4,8,16} that RateQuant acknowledges but doesn't solve, (c) applicability analysis is new.
3. **"The method only works on Qwen — isn't this a Qwen paper?"** → We systematically test 4-5 architectures spanning GQA 2:1 to 8:1 and honestly report negative results (Gemma-2, Mistral). The analysis contribution — characterizing *boundary conditions* of non-uniform quantization — generalizes beyond any single model and is more useful than a universally positive but misleading claim.
4. **"How does this work at different compression ratios?"** → Budget sweep across 2×, 4×, 8× (plan_005). Aggressive compression on Llama shows benefit amplifies even on low-heterogeneity models.
5. **"n=3/4/5 models is not enough for the heterogeneity claim"** → Acknowledged as limitation. We present directional evidence across 4-5 architectures spanning GQA 2:1 to 8:1, with a monotonic trend between GQA ratio, heterogeneity, and MCKP benefit. The Top-5% concentration diagnostic is a testable hypothesis, not a statistical claim.
6. **"RateQuant does K/V asymmetric allocation, do you?"** → Framework naturally treats K and V heads as independent items; plan_014 tests K/V separation.
7. **"Where are the downstream task results?"** → ✅ DONE (plan_012 + W3, all 5 models): Qwen (Spread): +1.25 to +4.00pp across 4 tasks, 72.8% avg recovery. Yi-1.5 (Spike): avg -0.77pp. Llama (Spike): avg -0.99pp (0/5 tasks positive — systematic). Mistral (Flat): avg -0.48pp. Gemma-2 (Flat): avg +0.14pp (noise). **Diagnostic predicts both PPL and downstream correctly across all 5 architectures**. Must report full per-task tables; use "shows minor degradation" not "preserves accuracy".
8. **"The profiler distortion=0.0 on Mistral suggests the profiling method is broken"** → Profiler correctly reports near-zero sensitivity differences. Some architectures genuinely have homogeneous head sensitivity, making non-uniform allocation futile.
9. **"If solver doesn't matter, why present MCKP at all?"** → (a) MCKP provides the formal framework for the constrained allocation problem — it's the lens through which we analyze the problem even if greedy solves it equally well, (b) presenting both solvers with identical results IS the evidence that the constraint is what matters, (c) for future extensions (more bit-widths, per-layer budgets), MCKP may regain advantage — we keep it as general framework.
