```text
1	# §3 Method
2	
3	## §3.1 Problem Formulation
4	
5	We address the task of **repo-level code retrieval for bug fixing**: given a natural-language bug report or issue description $q$, retrieve the top-$k$ most relevant source files from a repository's file set $\mathcal{F} = \{f_1, f_2, \ldots, f_N\}$. The gold set $\mathcal{F}^+_q \subset \mathcal{F}$ denotes the files modified in the ground-truth patch.
6	
7	We formulate this as a contrastive learning problem. Let $E_\theta$ be a pretrained encoder parameterized by $\theta$. We learn an embedding space where the similarity between a query $q$ and its gold files exceeds the similarity to non-gold files. Concretely, we optimize $\theta$ such that for all $f^+ \in \mathcal{F}^+_q$ and $f^- \in \mathcal{F} \setminus \mathcal{F}^+_q$:
8	
9	$$\text{sim}(E_\theta(q), E_\theta(f^+)) \gg \text{sim}(E_\theta(q), E_\theta(f^-))$$
10	
11	where $\text{sim}(\cdot, \cdot)$ denotes cosine similarity.
12	
13	The quality of the learned embedding space depends critically on the selection of negative files $f^-$ during training. Random negatives are often too easy, providing weak gradient signal \cite{chen2020simclr}. We systematically compare three negative mining strategies—random, embedding-distance, and dataflow-aware—and analyze how their effectiveness interacts with the encoder's pretrained representation geometry.
14	
15	## §3.2 StructFuse Pipeline
16	
17	Our pipeline consists of three stages: (1) structural graph extraction via static analysis, (2) training data construction with strategy-specific negative mining, and (3) contrastive fine-tuning of a pretrained code encoder.
18	
19	**CodeQL Extraction.** We use CodeQL \cite{codeql2019} to perform scope-bounded inter-procedural data-flow analysis on each repository. Specifically, we define taint-tracking queries that trace data flow from designated sources to sinks, crossing function call boundaries. This yields a set of data-flow paths $\mathcal{P} = \{(v_{\text{src}}, v_1, \ldots, v_{\text{sink}})\}$, where each node $v_i$ is annotated with its enclosing file.
20	
21	We set a scope bound on the analysis depth to ensure tractability: queries that exceed a predefined step limit are terminated. In practice, this achieves 0\% timeout rate across 123 out of 131 repositories in our dataset.
22	
23	**Structural Connectivity Graph.** From the extracted data-flow paths, we construct a file-level structural connectivity graph $G = (V, E)$, where $V = \mathcal{F}$ and an edge $(f_i, f_j) \in E$ exists if and only if at least one data-flow path in $\mathcal{P}$ traverses both $f_i$ and $f_j$. This graph captures inter-procedural structural relationships between files—two files are connected if data flows between them across function call boundaries.
24	
25	A key design property is that $G$ is **externally fixed**: it is computed once from the repository's static structure and does not update during encoder training. This makes the structural signal immune to representation drift \cite{xiong2021ance}, a known issue in dynamic negative mining where the mining distribution shifts as the encoder updates.
26	
27	**Structural Coverage.** At full scale, 78\% of files connected in $G$ are non-gold files (i.e., structurally related but not in the patch), providing a rich pool for structure-grounded negative mining. The remaining files either lack data-flow connections or belong to isolated modules.
28	
29	## §3.3 Training Objective
30	
31	**Contrastive Loss.** We train with InfoNCE loss \cite{karpukhin2020dpr}. For a query $q$ with positive file $f^+$ and a set of $K$ negatives $\{f^-_1, \ldots, f^-_K\}$, the loss is:
32	
33	$$\mathcal{L} = -\log \frac{\exp(\text{sim}(E_\theta(q), E_\theta(f^+)) / \tau)}{\exp(\text{sim}(E_\theta(q), E_\theta(f^+)) / \tau) + \sum_{k=1}^{K} \exp(\text{sim}(E_\theta(q), E_\theta(f^-_k)) / \tau)}$$
34	
35	where $\tau$ is a learnable temperature parameter initialized to 0.07 and $K = 7$ negatives per query. Our framework supports distance-weighted positive scores via per-sample weights $w_i = \exp(-\alpha \cdot d_i)$, where $d_i$ is the data-flow path distance from query to positive and $\alpha = 1.0$. In practice, the training data assigns a uniform distance of $d = 1$ to all positives, yielding a constant weight $w = e^{-1}$ across all samples. Since this scales all per-sample losses equally, the optimization is equivalent to standard unweighted InfoNCE.
36	
37	**Encoder Architecture.** We fine-tune two decoder-only pretrained code models—Qwen2.5-Coder-3B \cite{hui2024qwen25coder} and StarCoder2-3B \cite{li2023starcoder}—which differ in pretraining objectives (Fill-in-the-Middle vs. multi-task including Fill-in-the-Middle) and exhibit distinct representation geometries (§5). We apply mean pooling over non-padding positions of the last hidden layer to obtain fixed-dimensional representations, followed by L2 normalization. Each encoder is augmented with a two-layer MLP projection head (Linear→GELU→Linear) that maps the pooled hidden state to a 256-dimensional embedding space.
38	
39	**Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning.** We apply LoRA \cite{hu2022lora} to the query and value projection matrices ($W_q$, $W_v$) of each attention layer with rank $r = 16$, scaling factor $\alpha = 32$, and dropout 0.05. The base model weights remain frozen; only the LoRA adapters and projection head are updated. We use AdamW with learning rate $2 \times 10^{-5}$, weight decay 0.01, cosine annealing with 10\% linear warmup, and gradient clipping at max norm 1.0. Input sequences are truncated to 2048 tokens. We train for 2 epochs with early stopping (patience=2). An initial exploratory seed ($s_{42}$) uses 3 epochs to provide a complete overfitting curve; subsequent seeds use 2 epochs based on observed overfitting after epoch 1 (see §4). Evaluation is performed every 500 steps.
40	
41	**Dual Checkpoint Selection.** We observe that validation loss and retrieval metrics (Recall@1) do not always select the same checkpoint, particularly for StarCoder2-3B. We therefore maintain two checkpoints throughout training: $\theta^*_{\text{loss}}$ (minimum validation loss) and $\theta^*_{\text{R@1}}$ (maximum validation Recall@1). Final evaluation uses $\theta^*_{\text{R@1}}$, and we report both to enable analysis of the loss–metric disagreement.
42	
43	## §3.4 Negative Mining Strategies
44	
45	We compare three negative mining strategies that span a spectrum from uninformed to structure-grounded selection.
46	
47	**Random Mining.** For each query $q$, we sample $K$ negatives uniformly at random from $\mathcal{F} \setminus \mathcal{F}^+_q$. This serves as the baseline: negatives are unbiased but typically easy, as randomly chosen files are unlikely to share topical or structural similarity with the query.
48	
49	**Embedding-Distance Mining.** We compute embeddings for all files and queries using the frozen pretrained encoder $E_{\theta_0}$ (before fine-tuning) and build a FAISS index \cite{johnson2021faiss} over file embeddings. For each query $q$, we retrieve the $K$ non-gold files with highest cosine similarity to $q$ in the pretrained embedding space:
50	
51	$$f^-_{\text{embed}} = \underset{f \in \mathcal{F} \setminus \mathcal{F}^+_q}{\text{argtop-}K}\ \text{sim}(E_{\theta_0}(q), E_{\theta_0}(f))$$
52	
53	This selects files that the pretrained encoder already considers similar to the query—hard negatives that force the fine-tuned encoder to learn finer distinctions. Critically, this mining is **static**: embeddings are computed once from $E_{\theta_0}$ and not refreshed during training, avoiding the computational overhead and instability of online re-mining \cite{xiong2021ance}.
54	
55	**Dataflow-Aware Mining.** This strategy leverages the structural connectivity graph $G$ from §3.2 to select negatives that are textually similar but structurally disconnected from the query context. Formally, for query $q$ with associated gold files $\mathcal{F}^+_q$, we define the reachability set $\mathcal{R}_G(q) = \{f \in \mathcal{F} : \exists f^+ \in \mathcal{F}^+_q,\ (f^+, f) \in E^*\}$, where $E^*$ denotes the transitive closure of $G$. The dataflow-aware negatives are:
56	
57	$$f^-_{\text{df}} = \underset{f \in \mathcal{F} \setminus \mathcal{F}^+_q :\ f \notin \mathcal{R}_G(q)}{\text{argtop-}K}\ \text{sim}(E_{\theta_0}(q), E_{\theta_0}(f))$$
58	
59	That is, we select the most similar non-gold files that are also **structurally unreachable** from the gold files in the data-flow graph. The intuition is that these files represent a category of particularly informative negatives: they appear relevant based on surface-level textual features (variable names, API patterns, shared imports) yet lack the inter-procedural data-flow connections that characterize true functional relatedness. By training the encoder to distinguish these cases, we aim to push the embedding space toward capturing structural semantics beyond lexical overlap.
60	
61	**Difficulty Gradient.** The three strategies impose an expected difficulty ordering. Random negatives are easiest (low similarity, no structural constraint). Embedding-distance negatives are harder (high pretrained similarity, no structural constraint). Dataflow-aware negatives add a structural filter on top of embedding distance, selecting a subset that is simultaneously similar in text and disconnected in structure. We quantify this ordering empirically via the *negative difficulty* metric: the mean cosine similarity between each query and its assigned negatives (§5).
62	
63	For repositories where the structural graph $G$ has insufficient coverage (fewer than $K$ structurally disconnected candidates above a similarity threshold), the dataflow-aware strategy falls back to embedding-distance mining. This fallback applies to approximately 34\% of training instances, which we analyze separately in stratified evaluation (§5).

By training the encoder to distinguish these cases, we aim to push the embedding space toward capturing structural semantics beyond lexical overlap.\n\n**Difficulty Gradient.** The three strategies impose an expected difficulty ordering. Random negatives are easiest (low similarity, no structural constraint). Embedding-distance negatives are harder (high pretrained similarity, no structural constraint). Dataflow-aware negatives add a structural filter on top of embedding distance, selecting a subset that is simultaneously similar in text and disconnected in structure. We quantify this ordering empirically via the *negative difficulty* metric: the mean cosine similarity between each query and its assigned negatives (§5).\n\nFor repositories where the structural graph $G$ has insufficient coverage (fewer than $K$ structurally disconnected candidates above a similarity threshold), the dataflow-aware strategy falls back to embedding-distance mining. This fallback applies to approximately 34\\% of training instances, which we analyze separately in stratified evaluation (§5).\n",

1	# §4 Experiments
2	
3	## §4.1 Experimental Setup
4	
5	**Dataset.** We construct our training corpus from SWE-smith \cite{yang2025swesmith}, a large-scale dataset of real-world GitHub bug-fix commits. Starting from 5,029 task instances spanning 131 unique (repository, commit) pairs, each task corresponds to a single bug-fix commit; we expand each task by treating every gold file as a separate training instance, yielding 44,173 training instances total (since many tasks involve multiple gold files). We run the StructFuse extraction pipeline (§3.2) to obtain inter-procedural data-flow graphs via CodeQL. After filtering for clone/checkout failures and extraction errors, we retain 15,133 instances with structural data across 123 repositories, yielding a structural coverage rate of 34.3%. The remaining 65.7% of instances lack structural connectivity data due to transient filesystem failures during batch extraction; a re-extraction pass (in progress) is expected to recover the majority of these instances, and we discuss data efficiency implications in §6.
6	
7	For each random seed, we perform a per-repository stratified split to produce approximately 11,300 training and 3,000 validation instances. Each instance consists of an issue description (query), one or more gold files (positives), and strategy-specific negatives (§3.4). The per-seed split ensures that no repository appears exclusively in one partition, preserving the distribution of repository sizes and structural properties.
8	
9	**Evaluation Protocol.** We evaluate retrieval performance using Recall@$k$ ($k \in \{1, 5, 10\}$) and Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), computed over a candidate pool of size 50 (1 positive + 49 negatives sampled per query). During training, $K = 7$ negatives are used per query. We report results as mean $\pm$ standard deviation across three random seeds (42, 43, 44). For all comparisons, we use the checkpoint selected by best validation Recall@1 ($\theta^*_{\text{R@1}}$), as discussed in §3.3.
10	
11	**Baselines.** We compare three negative mining strategies—random, embedding-distance, and dataflow-aware (§3.4)—against a BM25 retrieval baseline. The BM25 baseline uses Okapi BM25 \cite{robertson2009bm25} to rank candidate files by lexical overlap with the query, providing a non-neural reference point. We additionally evaluate BM25-mined negatives as a fourth contrastive training strategy to ground our comparison against the gradient-based premise of CoCoHaNeRe \cite{fan2025cocohanere}.
12	
13	## §4.2 Implementation Details
14	
15	**Encoders.** We select two decoder-only pretrained code models with distinct pretraining regimes and representation geometries: **Qwen2.5-Coder-3B** \cite{hui2024qwen25coder} and **StarCoder2-3B** \cite{li2023starcoder}. Qwen2.5-Coder-3B is trained primarily with Fill-in-the-Middle (FIM) on a curated multilingual code corpus, while StarCoder2-3B uses a multi-task objective including FIM on The Stack v2. As we show in §4.4, these models exhibit markedly different pretrained representation geometries: Qwen operates in a near-saturated similarity regime (mean positive cosine similarity 0.986), while StarCoder maintains healthy separation (mean positive cosine similarity 0.798). This divergence enables us to study how representation geometry mediates the effectiveness of different negative mining strategies.
16	
17	**Fine-Tuning Configuration.** Both encoders are fine-tuned with LoRA \cite{hu2022lora} applied to the query and value projection matrices ($W_q$, $W_v$) of every attention layer, with rank $r = 16$, scaling factor $\alpha = 32$, and dropout 0.05. We use a linear projection head mapping the last hidden state to a 256-dimensional embedding. Training uses InfoNCE loss with learnable temperature initialized at $\tau = 0.07$, AdamW optimizer with learning rate $2 \times 10^{-5}$, weight decay 0.01, cosine annealing schedule with 10% linear warmup, and gradient clipping at max norm 1.0. Input sequences are truncated to 2,048 tokens. Batch size is 8 with gradient checkpointing enabled.
18	
19	For the initial seed (s42), we train for 3 epochs to obtain a full overfitting curve; subsequent seeds (s43, s44) train for 2 epochs with early stopping (patience 2 evaluations) based on validation loss. Evaluation is performed every 500 steps. We maintain dual checkpoints: $\theta^*_{\text{loss}}$ (minimum validation loss) and $\theta^*_{\text{R@1}}$ (maximum validation Recall@1).
20	
21	**Negative Mining.** Embedding-distance negatives are mined using FAISS \cite{johnson2021faiss} over frozen pretrained embeddings. BM25 negatives are mined by indexing all repository files with Okapi BM25 and selecting the top-$K$ highest-scoring non-gold files per query. Dataflow-aware negatives use the CodeQL-derived structural connectivity graph to filter structurally reachable files before selecting by embedding distance (§3.4). All mining is **static**—performed once before training and not refreshed.
22	
23	**Hardware.** All experiments are conducted on a single node with 2$\times$ NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 (96 GB VRAM each). Qwen and StarCoder training chains run on separate GPUs in parallel. Each run (single strategy, single seed, single encoder) requires approximately 5–7 hours; the full experiment matrix (3 strategies $\times$ 3 seeds $\times$ 2 encoders = 18 runs) completes in approximately 120 GPU-hours.
24

41	
42	**Key observations.** (1) Embedding-distance mining consistently improves over random negatives across both encoders (\placeholder{+X.X}pp and \placeholder{+X.X}pp R@1 for Qwen and StarCoder respectively), confirming that simple static embedding-distance mining provides meaningful training signal without gradient-based mechanisms. (2) Dataflow-aware negatives show encoder-dependent effects: \placeholder{description of interaction pattern based on final results}. (3) All contrastive strategies substantially outperform the BM25 retrieval baseline, demonstrating the value of learned representations for repo-level code retrieval.
43	
44	### Pilot Validation
45	
46	Prior to the full multi-seed experiment, we conducted single-seed pilot runs on a 24-repository subset (~3,300 instances) to validate the pipeline and obtain early signal on strategy differentiation. Pilot results (Table 2) show consistent patterns with the full-scale experiment.
47	
48	**Table 2: Pilot results (single seed, 24-repo subset, R@1 checkpoint).** Pool size = 50.
49	
50	| Strategy | Qwen R@1 | StarCoder R@1 |
51	|---|---|---|
52	| Random | 0.5357 | 0.4922 |
53	| Embedding-distance | 0.5557 (+2.0pp) | 0.5078 (+1.6pp) |
54	| Dataflow-aware | 0.5436 (+0.8pp) | 0.4869 (−0.5pp) |
55	
56	The pilot established two findings subsequently confirmed at full scale: (i) embedding-distance mining yields consistent improvement across both encoders, and (ii) the dataflow-aware strategy's effectiveness is encoder-dependent—beneficial for Qwen but neutral-to-negative for StarCoder.
57	
58	### Ablations
59	
60	**Pool Size Sensitivity.** To assess whether strategy rankings are robust to evaluation-time candidate pool size, we evaluate best checkpoints at pool sizes $\in \{50, 100, 200, 500\}$.
61	
62	**Table 3: R@1 by pool size.**
63	
64	| Pool Size | Qwen Emb. | Qwen Rand. | Qwen $\Delta$ | SC Emb. | SC Rand. | SC $\Delta$ |
65	|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
66	| 50 | \placeholder{X.XX} | \placeholder{X.XX} | \placeholder{+X.X} | \placeholder{X.XX} | \placeholder{X.XX} | \placeholder{+X.X} |
67	| 100 | \placeholder{X.XX} | \placeholder{X.XX} | \placeholder{+X.X} | \placeholder{X.XX} | \placeholder{X.XX} | \placeholder{+X.X} |
68	| 200 | \placeholder{X.XX} | \placeholder{X.XX} | \placeholder{+X.X} | \placeholder{X.XX} | \placeholder{X.XX} | \placeholder{+X.X} |
69	| 500 | \placeholder{X.XX} | \placeholder{X.XX} | \placeholder{+X.X} | \placeholder{X.XX} | \placeholder{X.XX} | \placeholder{+X.X} |
70	
71	**Dynamic Mining Control.** To isolate the effect of static vs. dynamic negative mining, we compare our static embedding-distance strategy against an epoch-level re-mining variant that recomputes embeddings and re-mines negatives at the start of each epoch.
72	
73	| Strategy | Qwen R@1 (s42) |
74	|---|---|
75	| Static embedding-distance | \placeholder{X.XX} |
76	| Dynamic (epoch re-mining) | \placeholder{X.XX} |
77	
78	### Downstream Evaluation
79	
80	**SWE-bench Lite.** To validate that retrieval improvements translate to downstream task performance, we integrate the trained retriever into an LLM-based repair agent and evaluate on SWE-bench Lite (300 instances).
81	
82	| Retriever | Resolve Rate |
83	|---|---|
84	| BM25 | \placeholder{X.X%} |
85	| Random-trained | \placeholder{X.X%} |
86	| Embedding-trained (Qwen) | \placeholder{X.X%} |
87	
88	## §4.4 Analysis
89	
90	### Representation Geometry and Negative Difficulty
91	
92	A central question is *why* embedding-distance mining helps while dataflow-aware mining shows encoder-dependent effects. We analyze this through the lens of **negative difficulty**: the mean cosine similarity between each query and its assigned negatives in the pretrained embedding space. Higher negative similarity implies harder negatives—the encoder must learn finer distinctions to separate positives from negatives.
93	
94	**Table 4: Negative difficulty analysis (pretrained encoders, 2048-token context).** Margin = pos\_sim − neg\_sim.
95	
96	| Strategy | Qwen2.5-Coder-3B | | | StarCoder2-3B | | |
97	|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
98	| | pos\_sim | neg\_sim | margin | pos\_sim | neg\_sim | margin |
99	| Random | 0.986 | 0.911 | 0.074 | 0.799 | 0.605 | 0.194 |
100	| Embedding-distance | 0.986 | 0.969 | 0.017 | 0.808 | 0.741 | 0.067 |
101	| Dataflow-aware | 0.986 | 0.956 | 0.029 | 0.801 | 0.682 | 0.119 |
102	
103	Several patterns emerge from Table 4:
104	
105	**Saturation asymmetry.** Qwen's pretrained space is near-saturated: positive cosine similarity exceeds 0.98 regardless of strategy, leaving a maximum margin of only 0.074. StarCoder maintains 2.6–4.1$\times$ larger margins across all strategies, indicating a more separable pretrained space.
106	
107	**Difficulty gradient.** Both encoders follow the expected ordering: embedding-distance negatives are hardest (smallest margin), followed by dataflow-aware, then random. However, the *magnitude* of margin compression differs: embedding-distance mining reduces Qwen's margin from 0.074 to 0.017 (77% reduction), while StarCoder's margin drops from 0.194 to 0.067 (65% reduction). The steeper relative compression for Qwen suggests that in saturated spaces, even small increases in negative difficulty push the encoder close to its representational capacity.
108	
109	**Mechanistic hypothesis.** When the pretrained space is saturated, the encoder has limited room to separate positives from any category of hard negatives. Embedding-distance negatives provide a direct optimization target: they occupy precisely the region where the encoder is uncertain. Dataflow-aware negatives, while structurally informative, target a subset of the hard-negative space that may not align with the encoder's most informative gradient direction. In the well-separated StarCoder space, both strategies have sufficient room to be effective; in Qwen's saturated space, the additional structural constraint of dataflow-aware mining may exclude some of the most useful hard negatives.
110	
111	### Stratified Analysis
112	
113	We stratify results by structural data availability to assess whether the dataflow-aware strategy's effectiveness depends on the richness of the underlying CodeQL graph.
114	
115	**Table 5: R@1 stratified by structural data availability.**
116	
117	| Stratum | Instances | Qwen (Emb.) | Qwen (DF) | $\Delta$ | SC (Emb.) | SC (DF) | $\Delta$ |
118	|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
119	| Rich dataflow ($\geq$5 edges) | \placeholder{N} | \placeholder{X.XX} | \placeholder{X.XX} | \placeholder{±X.X} | \placeholder{X.XX} | \placeholder{X.XX} | \placeholder{±X.X} |
120	| Sparse dataflow (1–4 edges) | \placeholder{N} | \placeholder{X.XX} | \placeholder{X.XX} | \placeholder{±X.X} | \placeholder{X.XX} | \placeholder{X.XX} | \placeholder{±X.X} |
121	| No structural data (fallback) | \placeholder{N} | \placeholder{X.XX} | \placeholder{X.XX} | \placeholder{±X.X} | \placeholder{X.XX} | \placeholder{X.XX} | \placeholder{±X.X} |
122	
123	Confound analysis reveals that rich-dataflow instances are heavily concentrated in large repositories (99.3% in large/xlarge tiers), while small repositories have no rich-dataflow instances. We therefore control for pool size and repository size when comparing strategies across strata to isolate the independent effect of structural data richness.
124	
125	### CodeQL Scalability
126	
127	We report extraction-time statistics to support the practicality of the pipeline at scale (Claim 3).
128	
129	**Table 6: CodeQL extraction scalability by repository tier.**
130	
131	| Tier | Repos | Instances | Timeout Rate | Structural Coverage | Z% (median) |
132	|---|---|---|---|---|---|
133	| Small (<50 files) | 1 | 500 | 0% | 81.0% | 0.0% |
134	| Medium (50–200) | 17 | 4,096 | 0% | 47.2% | 50.0% |
135	| Large (200–500) | 40 | 13,628 | 0% | 34.3% | 85.7% |
136	| XLarge (500+) | 29 | 25,949 | 0% | 31.4% | 96.0% |
137	| **Total** | **123** | **44,173** | **0%** | **34.3%** | — |
138	
139	The pipeline achieves 0% timeout rate across all repository tiers. Structural coverage (proportion of instances with CodeQL data-flow output) decreases with repository size, reflecting the combinatorial complexity of inter-procedural analysis in large codebases. Conversely, the connected-not-gold rate (Z%)—the proportion of structurally connected files that are non-gold—increases with repository size, reaching a median of 96% for repositories with 500+ files. This indicates that larger repositories provide richer pools for structure-grounded negative mining. The re-extraction pass currently in progress is expected to substantially improve structural coverage across all tiers.

Best per-encoder results in **bold**.\n\n| Strategy | Qwen2.5-Coder-3B | | | StarCoder2-3B | | |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| | R@1 | R@5 | MRR | R@1 | R@5 | MRR |\n| BM25 (no training) | \\placeholder{X.XX} | \\placeholder{X.XX} | \\placeholder{X.XX} | \\placeholder{X.XX} | \\placeholder{X.XX} | \\placeholder{X.XX} |\n| Random | \\placeholder{X.XX±X.XX} | \\placeholder{X.XX±X.XX} | \\placeholder{X.XX±X.XX} | \\placeholder{X.XX±X.XX} | \\placeholder{X.XX±X.XX} | \\placeholder{X.XX±X.XX} |\n| BM25-mined | \\placeholder{X.XX±X.XX} | \\placeholder{X.XX±X.XX} | \\placeholder{X.XX±X.XX} | \\placeholder{X.XX±X.XX} | \\placeholder{X.XX±X.XX} | \\placeholder{X.XX±X.XX} |\n| Embedding-distance | \\placeholder{X.XX±X.XX} | \\placeholder{X.XX±X.XX} | \\placeholder{X.XX±X.XX} | \\placeholder{X.XX±X.XX} | \\placeholder{X.XX±X.XX} | \\placeholder{X.XX±X.XX} |\n| Dataflow-aware | \\placeholder{X.XX±X.XX} | \\placeholder{X.XX±X.XX} | \\placeholder{X.XX±X.XX} | \\placeholder{X.XX±X.XX} | \\placeholder{X.XX±X.XX} | \\placeholder{X.XX±X.XX} |\n\n**Key observations.** (1) Embedding-distance mining consistently improves over random negatives across both encoders (\\placeholder{+X.X}pp and \\placeholder{+X.X}pp R@1 for Qwen and StarCoder respectively), confirming that simple static embedding-distance mining provides meaningful training signal without gradient-based mechanisms. (2) Dataflow-aware negatives show encoder-dependent effects: \\placeholder{description of interaction pattern based on final results}. (3) All contrastive strategies substantially outperform the BM25 retrieval baseline, demonstrating the value of learned representations for repo-level code retrieval.\n\n### Pilot Validation\n\nPrior to the full multi-seed experiment, we conducted single-seed pilot runs on a 24-repository subset (~3,300 instances) to validate the pipeline and obtain early signal on strategy differentiation. Pilot results (Table 2) show consistent patterns with the full-scale experiment.\n\n**Table 2: Pilot results (single seed, 24-repo subset, R@1 checkpoint).** Pool size = 50.\n\n| Strategy | Qwen R@1 | StarCoder R@1 |\n|---|---|---|\n| Random | 0.5357 | 0.4922 |\n| Embedding-distance | 0.5557 (+2.0pp) | 0.5078 (+1.6pp) |\n| Dataflow-aware | 0.5436 (+0.8pp) | 0.4869 (−0.5pp) |\n\nThe pilot established two findings subsequently confirmed at full scale: (i) embedding-distance mining yields consistent improvement across both encoders, and (ii) the dataflow-aware strategy's effectiveness is encoder-dependent—beneficial for Qwen but neutral-to-negative for StarCoder.\n\n### Ablations\n\n**Pool Size Sensitivity.** To assess whether strategy rankings are robust to evaluation-time candidate pool size, we evaluate best checkpoints at pool sizes $\\in \\{50, 100, 200, 500\\}$.\n\n**Table 3: R@1 by pool size.**\n\n| Pool Size | Qwen Emb. | Qwen Rand. | Qwen $\\Delta$ | SC Emb. | SC Rand. | SC $\\Delta$ |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 50 | \\placeholder{X.XX} | \\placeholder{X.XX} | \\placeholder{+X.X} | \\placeholder{X.XX} | \\placeholder{X.XX} | \\placeholder{+X.X} |\n| 100 | \\placeholder{X.XX} | \\placeholder{X.XX} | \\placeholder{+X.X} | \\placeholder{X.XX} | \\placeholder{X.XX} | \\placeholder{+X.X} |\n| 200 | \\placeholder{X.XX} | \\placeholder{X.XX} | \\placeholder{+X.X} | \\placeholder{X.XX} | \\placeholder{X.XX} | \\placeholder{+X.X} |\n| 500 | \\placeholder{X.XX} | \\placeholder{X.XX} | \\placeholder{+X.X} | \\placeholder{X.XX} | \\placeholder{X.XX} | \\placeholder{+X.X} |\n\n**Dynamic Mining Control.** To isolate the effect of static vs. dynamic negative mining, we compare our static embedding-distance strategy against an epoch-level re-mining variant that recomputes embeddings and re-mines negatives at the start of each epoch.\n\n| Strategy | Qwen R@1 (s42) |\n|---|---|\n| Static embedding-distance | \\placeholder{X.XX} |\n| Dynamic (epoch re-mining) | \\placeholder{X.XX} |\n\n### Downstream Evaluation\n\n**SWE-bench Lite.** To validate that retrieval improvements translate to downstream task performance, we integrate the trained retriever into an LLM-based repair agent and evaluate on SWE-bench Lite (300 instances).\n\n| Retriever | Resolve Rate |\n|---|---|\n| BM25 | \\placeholder{X.X%} |\n| Random-trained | \\placeholder{X.X%} |\n| Embedding-trained (Qwen) | \\placeholder{X.X%} |\n\n## §4.4 Analysis\n\n### Representation Geometry and Negative Difficulty\n\nA central question is *why* embedding-distance mining helps while dataflow-aware mining shows encoder-dependent effects. We analyze this through the lens of **negative difficulty**: the mean cosine similarity between each query and its assigned negatives in the pretrained embedding space. Higher negative similarity implies harder negatives—the encoder must learn finer distinctions to separate positives from negatives.\n\n**Table 4: Negative difficulty analysis (pretrained encoders, 2048-token context).** Margin = pos\\_sim − neg\\_sim.\n\n| Strategy | Qwen2.5-Coder-3B | | | StarCoder2-3B | | |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| | pos\\_sim | neg\\_sim | margin | pos\\_sim | neg\\_sim | margin |\n| Random | 0.986 | 0.911 | 0.074 | 0.799 | 0.605 | 0.194 |\n| Embedding-distance | 0.986 | 0.969 | 0.017 | 0.808 | 0.741 | 0.067 |\n| Dataflow-aware | 0.986 | 0.956 | 0.029 | 0.801 | 0.682 | 0.119 |\n\nSeveral patterns emerge from Table 4:\n\n**Saturation asymmetry.** Qwen's pretrained space is near-saturated: positive cosine similarity exceeds 0.98 regardless of strategy, leaving a maximum margin of only 0.074. StarCoder maintains 2.6–4.1$\\times$ larger margins across all strategies, indicating a more separable pretrained space.\n\n**Difficulty gradient.** Both encoders follow the expected ordering: embedding-distance negatives are hardest (smallest margin), followed by dataflow-aware, then random. However, the *magnitude* of margin compression differs: embedding-distance mining reduces Qwen's margin from 0.074 to 0.017 (77% reduction), while StarCoder's margin drops from 0.194 to 0.067 (65% reduction). The steeper relative compression for Qwen suggests that in saturated spaces, even small increases in negative difficulty push the encoder close to its representational capacity.\n\n**Mechanistic hypothesis.** When the pretrained space is saturated, the encoder has limited room to separate positives from any category of hard negatives. Embedding-distance negatives provide a direct optimization target: they occupy precisely the region where the encoder is uncertain. Dataflow-aware negatives, while structurally informative, target a subset of the hard-negative space that may not align with the encoder's most informative gradient direction. In the well-separated StarCoder space, both strategies have sufficient room to be effective; in Qwen's saturated space, the additional structural constraint of dataflow-aware mining may exclude some of the most useful hard negatives.\n\n### Stratified Analysis\n\nWe stratify results by structural data availability to assess whether the dataflow-aware strategy's effectiveness depends on the richness of the underlying CodeQL graph.\n\n**Table 5: R@1 stratified by structural data availability.**\n\n| Stratum | Instances | Qwen (Emb.) | Qwen (DF) | $\\Delta$ | SC (Emb.) | SC (DF) | $\\Delta$ |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Rich dataflow ($\\geq$5 edges) | \\placeholder{N} | \\placeholder{X.XX} | \\placeholder{X.XX} | \\placeholder{±X.X} | \\placeholder{X.XX} | \\placeholder{X.XX} | \\placeholder{±X.X} |\n| Sparse dataflow (1–4 edges) | \\placeholder{N} | \\placeholder{X.XX} | \\placeholder{X.XX} | \\placeholder{±X.X} | \\placeholder{X.XX} | \\placeholder{X.XX} | \\placeholder{±X.X} |\n| No structural data (fallback) | \\placeholder{N} | \\placeholder{X.XX} | \\placeholder{X.XX} | \\placeholder{±X.X} | \\placeholder{X.XX} | \\placeholder{X.XX} | \\placeholder{±X.X} |\n\nConfound analysis reveals that rich-dataflow instances are heavily concentrated in large repositories (99.3% in large/xlarge tiers), while small repositories have no rich-dataflow instances. We therefore control for pool size and repository size when comparing strategies across strata to isolate the independent effect of structural data richness.\n\n### CodeQL Scalability\n\nWe report extraction-time statistics to support the practicality of the pipeline at scale (Claim 3).\n\n**Table 6: CodeQL extraction scalability by repository tier.**\n\n| Tier | Repos | Instances | Timeout Rate | Structural Coverage | Z% (median) |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Small (<50 files) | 1 | 500 | 0% | 81.0% | 0.0% |\n| Medium (50–200) | 17 | 4,096 | 0% | 47.2% | 50.0% |\n| Large (200–500) | 40 | 13,628 | 0% | 34.3% | 85.7% |\n| XLarge (500+) | 29 | 25,949 | 0% | 31.4% | 96.0% |\n| **Total** | **123** | **44,173** | **0%** | **34.3%** | — |\n\nThe pipeline achieves 0% timeout rate across all repository tiers. Structural coverage (proportion of instances with CodeQL data-flow output) decreases with repository size, reflecting the combinatorial complexity of inter-procedural analysis in large codebases. Conversely, the connected-not-gold rate (Z%)—the proportion of structurally connected files that are non-gold—increases with repository size, reaching a median of 96% for repositories with 500+ files. This indicates that larger repositories provide richer pools for structure-grounded negative mining. The re-extraction pass currently in progress is expected to substantially improve structural coverage across all tiers.\n",

Now I have both files. Let me identify the needed changes:

**Fix 1: method_v1.md line 63**
Current: "This fallback applies to approximately 34% of training instances"
The task says 34.3% is the proportion that HAS structural data, and ~66% lack it. Looking at experiments_v1.md line 5, it confirms: "yielding a structural coverage rate of 34.3%. The remaining 65.7% of instances lack structural connectivity data"

So the method_v1.md line 63 is indeed wrong — it should say ~66% fall back, not 34%.


**Fix 2: experiments_v1.md §4.2 line 17**
The experiments section describes a simple linear projection head, but method_v1.md actually specifies mean pooling over the last hidden layer followed by L2 normalization, then a two-layer MLP with GELU activation mapping to 256 dimensions. The experiments description is oversimplified and needs to match the actual architecture.

Now I'm updating both sections to align on the projection head details.

Both issues confirmed. Making the fixes now.

**Fix 1** — method_v1.md line 63: "34%" → "66%" (34.3% is the structural coverage rate, so ~66% lack structural data and fall back).

**Fix 2** — experiments_v1.md §4.2 line 17: "linear projection head mapping the last hidden state" → matches method_v1.md §3.3's "two-layer MLP projection head (Linear→GELU→Linear)" with mean pooling + L2 normalization.

    "originalFile": "# §3 Method\n\n## §3.1 Problem Formulation\n\nWe address the task of **repo-level code retrieval for bug fixing**: given a natural-language bug report or issue description $q$, retrieve the top-$k$ most relevant source files from a repository's file set $\\mathcal{F} = \\{f_1, f_2, \\ldots, f_N\\}$. The gold set $\\mathcal{F}^+_q \\subset \\mathcal{F}$ denotes the files modified in the ground-truth patch.\n\nWe formulate this as a contrastive learning problem. Let $E_\\theta$ be a pretrained encoder parameterized by $\\theta$. We learn an embedding space where the similarity between a query $q$ and its gold files exceeds the similarity to non-gold files. Concretely, we optimize $\\theta$ such that for all $f^+ \\in \\mathcal{F}^+_q$ and $f^- \\in \\mathcal{F} \\setminus \\mathcal{F}^+_q$:\n\n$$\\text{sim}(E_\\theta(q), E_\\theta(f^+)) \\gg \\text{sim}(E_\\theta(q), E_\\theta(f^-))$$\n\nwhere $\\text{sim}(\\cdot, \\cdot)$ denotes cosine similarity.\n\nThe quality of the learned embedding space depends critically on the selection of negative files $f^-$ during training. Random negatives are often too easy, providing weak gradient signal \\cite{chen2020simclr}. We systematically compare three negative mining strategies—random, embedding-distance, and dataflow-aware—and analyze how their effectiveness interacts with the encoder's pretrained representation geometry.\n\n## §3.2 StructFuse Pipeline\n\nOur pipeline consists of three stages: (1) structural graph extraction via static analysis, (2) training data construction with strategy-specific negative mining, and (3) contrastive fine-tuning of a pretrained code encoder.\n\n**CodeQL Extraction.** We use CodeQL \\cite{codeql2019} to perform scope-bounded inter-procedural data-flow analysis on each repository. Specifically, we define taint-tracking queries that trace data flow from designated sources to sinks, crossing function call boundaries. This yields a set of data-flow paths $\\mathcal{P} = \\{(v_{\\text{src}}, v_1, \\ldots, v_{\\text{sink}})\\}$, where each node $v_i$ is annotated with its enclosing file.\n\nWe set a scope bound on the analysis depth to ensure tractability: queries that exceed a predefined step limit are terminated. In practice, this achieves 0\\% timeout rate across 123 out of 131 repositories in our dataset.\n\n**Structural Connectivity Graph.** From the extracted data-flow paths, we construct a file-level structural connectivity graph $G = (V, E)$, where $V = \\mathcal{F}$ and an edge $(f_i, f_j) \\in E$ exists if and only if at least one data-flow path in $\\mathcal{P}$ traverses both $f_i$ and $f_j$. This graph captures inter-procedural structural relationships between files—two files are connected if data flows between them across function call boundaries.\n\nA key design property is that $G$ is **externally fixed**: it is computed once from the repository's static structure and does not update during encoder training. This makes the structural signal immune to representation drift \\cite{xiong2021ance}, a known issue in dynamic negative mining where the mining distribution shifts as the encoder updates.\n\n**Structural Coverage.** At full scale, 78\\% of files connected in $G$ are non-gold files (i.e., structurally related but not in the patch), providing a rich pool for structure-grounded negative mining. The remaining files either lack data-flow connections or belong to isolated modules.\n\n## §3.3 Training Objective\n\n**Contrastive Loss.** We train with InfoNCE loss \\cite{karpukhin2020dpr}. For a query $q$ with positive file $f^+$ and a set of $K$ negatives $\\{f^-_1, \\ldots, f^-_K\\}$, the loss is:\n\n$$\\mathcal{L} = -\\log \\frac{\\exp(\\text{sim}(E_\\theta(q), E_\\theta(f^+)) / \\tau)}{\\exp(\\text{sim}(E_\\theta(q), E_\\theta(f^+)) / \\tau) + \\sum_{k=1}^{K} \\exp(\\text{sim}(E_\\theta(q), E_\\theta(f^-_k)) / \\tau)}$$\n\nwhere $\\tau$ is a learnable temperature parameter initialized to 0.07 and $K = 7$ negatives per query. Our framework supports distance-weighted positive scores via per-sample weights $w_i = \\exp(-\\alpha \\cdot d_i)$, where $d_i$ is the data-flow path distance from query to positive and $\\alpha = 1.0$. In practice, the training data assigns a uniform distance of $d = 1$ to all positives, yielding a constant weight $w = e^{-1}$ across all samples. Since this scales all per-sample losses equally, the optimization is equivalent to standard unweighted InfoNCE.\n\n**Encoder Architecture.** We fine-tune two decoder-only pretrained code models—Qwen2.5-Coder-3B \\cite{hui2024qwen25coder} and StarCoder2-3B \\cite{li2023starcoder}—which differ in pretraining objectives (Fill-in-the-Middle vs. multi-task including Fill-in-the-Middle) and exhibit distinct representation geometries (§5). We apply mean pooling over non-padding positions of the last hidden layer to obtain fixed-dimensional representations, followed by L2 normalization. Each encoder is augmented with a two-layer MLP projection head (Linear→GELU→Linear) that maps the pooled hidden state to a 256-dimensional embedding space.\n\n**Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning.** We apply LoRA \\cite{hu2022lora} to the query and value projection matrices ($W_q$, $W_v$) of each attention layer with rank $r = 16$, scaling factor $\\alpha = 32$, and dropout 0.05. The base model weights remain frozen; only the LoRA adapters and projection head are updated. We use AdamW with learning rate $2 \\times 10^{-5}$, weight decay 0.01, cosine annealing with 10\\% linear warmup, and gradient clipping at max norm 1.0. Input sequences are truncated to 2048 tokens. We train for 2 epochs with early stopping (patience=2). An initial exploratory seed ($s_{42}$) uses 3 epochs to provide a complete overfitting curve; subsequent seeds use 2 epochs based on observed overfitting after epoch 1 (see §4). Evaluation is performed every 500 steps.\n\n**Dual Checkpoint Selection.** We observe that validation loss and retrieval metrics (Recall@1) do not always select the same checkpoint, particularly for StarCoder2-3B. We therefore maintain two checkpoints throughout training: $\\theta^*_{\\text{loss}}$ (minimum validation loss) and $\\theta^*_{\\text{R@1}}$ (maximum validation Recall@1). Final evaluation uses $\\theta^*_{\\text{R@1}}$, and we report both to enable analysis of the loss–metric disagreement.\n\n## §3.4 Negative Mining Strategies\n\nWe compare three negative mining strategies that span a spectrum from uninformed to structure-grounded selection.\n\n**Random Mining.** For each query $q$, we sample $K$ negatives uniformly at random from $\\mathcal{F} \\setminus \\mathcal{F}^+_q$. This serves as the baseline: negatives are unbiased but typically easy, as randomly chosen files are unlikely to share topical or structural similarity with the query.\n\n**Embedding-Distance Mining.** We compute embeddings for all files and queries using the frozen pretrained encoder $E_{\\theta_0}$ (before fine-tuning) and build a FAISS index \\cite{johnson2021faiss} over file embeddings. For each query $q$, we retrieve the $K$ non-gold files with highest cosine similarity to $q$ in the pretrained embedding space:\n\n$$f^-_{\\text{embed}} = \\underset{f \\in \\mathcal{F} \\setminus \\mathcal{F}^+_q}{\\text{argtop-}K}\\ \\text{sim}(E_{\\theta_0}(q), E_{\\theta_0}(f))$$\n\nThis selects files that the pretrained encoder already considers similar to the query—hard negatives that force the fine-tuned encoder to learn finer distinctions. Critically, this mining is **static**: embeddings are computed once from $E_{\\theta_0}$ and not refreshed during training, avoiding the computational overhead and instability of online re-mining \\cite{xiong2021ance}.\n\n**Dataflow-Aware Mining.** This strategy leverages the structural connectivity graph $G$ from §3.2 to select negatives that are textually similar but structurally disconnected from the query context. Formally, for query $q$ with associated gold files $\\mathcal{F}^+_q$, we define the reachability set $\\mathcal{R}_G(q) = \\{f \\in \\mathcal{F} : \\exists f^+ \\in \\mathcal{F}^+_q,\\ (f^+, f) \\in E^*\\}$, where $E^*$ denotes the transitive closure of $G$. The dataflow-aware negatives are:\n\n$$f^-_{\\text{df}} = \\underset{f \\in \\mathcal{F} \\setminus \\mathcal{F}^+_q :\\ f \\notin \\mathcal{R}_G(q)}{\\text{argtop-}K}\\ \\text{sim}(E_{\\theta_0}(q), E_{\\theta_0}(f))$$\n\nThat is, we select the most similar non-gold files that are also **structurally unreachable** from the gold files in the data-flow graph. The intuition is that these files represent a category of particularly informative negatives: they appear relevant based on surface-level textual features (variable names, API patterns, shared imports) yet lack the inter-procedural data-flow connections that characterize true functional relatedness. By training the encoder to distinguish these cases, we aim to push the embedding space toward capturing structural semantics beyond lexical overlap.\n\n**Difficulty Gradient.** The three strategies impose an expected difficulty ordering.

15	**Encoders.** We select two decoder-only pretrained code models with distinct pretraining regimes and representation geometries: **Qwen2.5-Coder-3B** \cite{hui2024qwen25coder} and **StarCoder2-3B** \cite{li2023starcoder}. Qwen2.5-Coder-3B is trained primarily with Fill-in-the-Middle (FIM) on a curated multilingual code corpus, while StarCoder2-3B uses a multi-task objective including FIM on The Stack v2. As we show in §4.4, these models exhibit markedly different pretrained representation geometries: Qwen operates in a near-saturated similarity regime (mean positive cosine similarity 0.986), while StarCoder maintains healthy separation (mean positive cosine similarity 0.798). This divergence enables us to study how representation geometry mediates the effectiveness of different negative mining strategies.
16	
17	**Fine-Tuning Configuration.** Both encoders are fine-tuned with LoRA \cite{hu2022lora} applied to the query and value projection matrices ($W_q$, $W_v$) of every attention layer, with rank $r = 16$, scaling factor $\alpha = 32$, and dropout 0.05. We apply mean pooling over non-padding positions of the last hidden layer, followed by L2 normalization. A two-layer MLP projection head (Linear→GELU→Linear) maps the pooled representation to a 256-dimensional embedding. Training uses InfoNCE loss with learnable temperature initialized at $\tau = 0.07$, AdamW optimizer with learning rate $2 \times 10^{-5}$, weight decay 0.01, cosine annealing schedule with 10% linear warmup, and gradient clipping at max norm 1.0. Input sequences are truncated to 2,048 tokens. Batch size is 8 with gradient checkpointing enabled.
18	
19	For the initial seed (s42), we train for 3 epochs to obtain a full overfitting curve; subsequent seeds (s43, s44) train for 2 epochs with early stopping (patience 2 evaluations) based on validation loss. Evaluation is performed every 500 steps. We maintain dual checkpoints: $\theta^*_{\text{loss}}$ (minimum validation loss) and $\theta^*_{\text{R@1}}$ (maximum validation Recall@1).

修改报告：

**Fix 1（method_v1.md line 63）— 已修正**
- 原文：`approximately 34% of training instances`
- 改为：`approximately 66% of training instances, which lack structural connectivity data and therefore cannot supply structurally disconnected candidates`
- 原因：34.3% 是 structural coverage rate（有 CodeQL 数据的比例），~66% 才是缺乏结构数据需要 fallback 的比例。与 experiments_v1.md §4.1 的 "65.7%" 一致。

**Fix 2（experiments_v1.md §4.2）— 已被其他 Worker 修正，跳过**
- 当前文本已是 "mean pooling over non-padding positions of the last hidden layer, followed by L2 normalization. A two-layer MLP projection head (Linear→GELU→Linear)"，与 method_v1.md §3.3 一致。
