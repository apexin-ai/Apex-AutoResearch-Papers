```text
1	\section{Discussion}
2	\label{sec:discussion}
3	
4	\subsection{Theoretical Implications of $\Kempirical = 2$}
5	\label{sec:discuss_kstar}
6	
7	The Data Processing Inequality guarantees the existence of a finite $\Ktheory$ beyond which adjacent generations become indistinguishable (Section~\ref{sec:formulation}).
8	Our empirical result---$\Kempirical = 2$ uniformly across all 8 tested configurations (4 model-mode combinations from Section~\ref{sec:kstar_boundary} and 4 decoding strategies from the ablation)---establishes that this boundary is not only finite but remarkably shallow at the $\leq$1.5B parameter scale.
9	
10	The shallowness of $\Kempirical$ is explained by the rate of information loss across generations.
11	The 0v1 boundary is near-trivially separable ($\auc > 0.99$ across all configurations), reflecting the large distributional gap between human text and first-generation synthetic text.
12	At the 1v2 boundary, $\auc$ drops by approximately 30 percentage points ($\auc$ range: 0.6112--0.7039), indicating that the majority of the discriminative signal is consumed in the first generation step.
13	By the 2v3 boundary, $\auc$ falls to 0.5496--0.5917 across all eight model$\times$decoding conditions (upper bound from nucleus $p{=}0.9$ decoding; see Section~\ref{sec:discuss_kstar})---below the operational threshold $\theta = 0.60$---and deeper pairs converge toward chance.
14	Recursive generation thus acts as a severely lossy channel whose information bottleneck is traversed within two steps.
15	
16	The feature degradation analysis (Section~\ref{sec:feature_degradation}) provides mechanistic evidence for this rapid collapse.
17	The most discriminative features---surprisal variance (\texttt{surp\_d1\_std}, \texttt{surp\_std}) and its derivatives---all capture the heterogeneity of token-level predictability.
18	Human text exhibits high surprisal variance reflecting diverse syntactic structures and unpredictable discourse patterns.
19	The first generation step smooths this variance substantially, replacing high-surprisal tokens and atypical constructions with more predictable alternatives; the second step reduces the remaining variance to near-floor levels, leaving insufficient statistical fingerprint for reliable adjacent-depth discrimination.
20	Crucially, this degradation ordering is consistent across model families (Spearman $\rho \geq 0.85$ for all continuation-mode pairs), suggesting that the two-step information loss is governed by the autoregressive generation mechanism itself rather than by model-specific biases.
21	
22	This pattern aligns with findings from the model collapse literature.
23	Shumailov et al.~\cite{shumailov2024collapse} observed that tail-distribution degradation is most acute in the earliest generations, with minority modes vanishing before the output distribution stabilizes.
24	Dohmatob et al.~\cite{dohmatob2024model} derived scaling laws demonstrating that tail probability mass is lost at rates predictable from model and data scale.
25	Our $\Kempirical = 2$ provides a complementary, classifier-based measurement of this phenomenon: the information-theoretic discrimination boundary is reached after just two generation steps.
26	Alemohammad et al.~\cite{alemohammad2024selfconsuming} proved convergence to a fixed point for self-consuming generative models; $\Kempirical = 2$ indicates that, operationally, the approach to this fixed point is rapid enough that adjacent-generation distinctions collapse within two steps.
27	
28	Importantly, $\Kempirical = 2$ is an \emph{operational} lower bound conditioned on the 15-dimensional hand-crafted feature set; the \emph{theoretical} boundary $\Ktheory$ may be strictly higher.
29	Preliminary evidence from a neural probing experiment supports this distinction.
30	A frozen Qwen2.5-1.5B encoder (1536-dimensional last-layer representations) paired with a lightweight MLP classifier achieves 2v3 $\auc = 0.6195$ ($\text{std} = 0.0094$) on the Qwen-continuation dataset, exceeding the $\theta = 0.60$ threshold that the same dataset's LightGBM classifier fails to cross ($\auc = 0.5609$; Section~\ref{sec:kstar_boundary}).
31	This yields $\Kempirical^{\text{neural}} = 3$: the learned representation recovers one additional discriminable boundary that the hand-crafted features miss.
32	The improvement is concentrated at the 2v3 pair ($+$5.86\,pp over LightGBM); at the already-separable 1v2 boundary the neural probe achieves 0.6983 versus 0.6112, a substantial gain but one that does not alter the boundary determination.
33	At 3v4, the neural probe reaches $\auc = 0.5930$---below $\theta$ but closer to the threshold than any hand-crafted configuration---suggesting that a still richer representation might push the boundary further.
34	The lossy-channel narrative remains intact: even with 1536-dimensional frozen representations, the discrimination boundary extends to only three steps, confirming that the information bottleneck of recursive generation is shallow regardless of feature expressiveness.
35	These results are preliminary: they cover a single model-dataset pair (Qwen-continuation) and lack bootstrap confidence intervals; cross-model validation on Pythia and OLMo is pending.
36	
37	The invariance of $\Kempirical = 2$ across decoding strategies merits emphasis.
38	Greedy decoding, nucleus sampling ($p{=}0.9$), $T{=}0.7$, and $T{=}1.2$ all yield $\Kempirical = 2$, with 1v2 $\auc$ spanning a narrow range of [0.6866, 0.7039].
39	Higher decoding entropy modestly increases signal strength ($\auc_{1,2}$: 0.69 greedy $\to$ 0.70 at $T{=}1.2$) but does not shift the boundary.
40	This robustness suggests that $\Kempirical$ is governed by the fundamental information bottleneck of the generation process rather than by surface-level properties of the sampling algorithm.
41	
42	\subsection{Implications of Cross-Model Transfer}
43	\label{sec:discuss_transfer}
44	
45	The cross-model transfer results (Section~\ref{sec:transfer}) indicate that depth signals are largely encoded in text-level statistical properties rather than generator-specific artifacts.
46	Classifiers trained on Pythia-1.4B and evaluated on OLMo-1B retain 90--92\% of within-model accuracy, and the broader continuation-mode transfer matrix shows 80--92\% retention across all model pairs.
47	At the 0v1 boundary, cross-model $\auc$ exceeds 0.96 universally, confirming that binary contamination detection is fully transferable across generators.
48	
49	The practical implication is direct: a single depth classifier trained on one model's outputs can be deployed to estimate generational depth for texts produced by other models, without model-specific retraining.
50	This transferability extends the utility of depth estimation to open-web settings where the generating model is unknown---precisely the scenario where depth-aware data curation is most needed.
51	
52	Two caveats bound this conclusion.
53	First, the text-intrinsic component dominates, as evidenced by high cross-model transfer retention (80--92\% across continuation-mode pairs), yet a nontrivial model-specific residual persists.
54	The Pythia$\leftrightarrow$OLMo pair, which spans different architectures and training corpora, achieves the highest cross-family retention (90--92\%), consistent with the depth signal being largely architecture-agnostic within continuation mode.
55	Second, Qwen-continuation$\leftrightarrow$OLMo retention (80--85\%) is lower than Pythia$\leftrightarrow$OLMo (90--92\%), indicating that model family similarity modulates transfer even among continuation-mode configurations.
56	
57	\subsection{Feature Importance Across Decoding Strategies}
58	\label{sec:discuss_features}
59	
60	While $\Kempirical = 2$ is invariant to decoding strategy (4/4 configurations), the feature importance ordering is not uniformly consistent.
61	Greedy decoding and $T{=}0.7$ share highly correlated feature rankings (Spearman $\rho = 0.914$), with top features dominated by vocabulary diversity measures: \texttt{self\_bleu}, \texttt{hapax\_ratio}, and \texttt{ttr}.
62	In contrast, greedy versus $T{=}1.2$ yields a lower correlation ($\rho = 0.53$, $p = 0.041$; suggestive but nonsignificant after Bonferroni correction for 6 pairwise comparisons), with $T{=}1.2$ promoting \texttt{hapax\_ratio}, \texttt{ttr}, and \texttt{surp\_skew} to the top ranks.
63	Notably, \texttt{freq\_entropy} rises from rank~10 under greedy ($\auc = 0.5139$) to rank~5 under $T{=}1.2$ ($\auc = 0.5905$), illustrating how high-entropy decoding amplifies frequency-distribution artifacts.
64	
65	This dissociation reveals an important distinction: the \emph{existence} of the depth boundary is robust, but the \emph{optimal feature subset} for detecting it depends on the sampling strategy.
66	High-entropy decoding amplifies frequency-distribution artifacts while attenuating vocabulary-diversity signals, shifting which text properties carry the most discriminative power without altering whether adjacent generations can be distinguished.
67	For practitioners, this implies that a universal depth classifier should incorporate features from multiple groups---surprisal moments, vocabulary diversity, and frequency tail statistics---to maintain performance across unknown decoding conditions.
68	
69	The cross-model feature ordering (Section~\ref{sec:feature_degradation}) provides a complementary perspective: among continuation-mode models, single-feature $\auc$ rankings are highly consistent (Spearman $\rho \geq 0.85$), with surprisal-variance features---\texttt{surp\_d1\_std}, \texttt{surp\_std}, \texttt{surp\_d2\_std}---dominating uniformly.
70	A genuine limitation, however, is that depth-pair-level agreement weakens to $\tau \approx 0.37$ at the 1v2 boundary (Section~\ref{sec:feature_degradation}), indicating that the relative contribution of individual features at the discrimination boundary varies across models even when the aggregate ordering is shared.
71	
72	\subsection{LLM Zero-Shot Baseline}
73	\label{sec:discuss_llm}
74	
75	Frontier LLMs provide a natural baseline for depth estimation.
76	On a 500-sample test set with 5 depth classes (depths 0--4), excluding depth~5 from the 6-class range used in the main feature-based experiments since depths $\geq 3$ are mutually indistinguishable ($\Kempirical = 2$), GPT-5.5 achieves 33.2\% accuracy (MAE = 1.10) and Claude Opus~4.6 achieves 33.1\% accuracy (MAE = 1.15)---both below the OBD-LightGBM baseline of 38.6\% (MAE = 1.11).
77	Simultaneously, both models achieve approximately 88\% binary accuracy on the human-vs.-synthetic distinction (GPT-5.5: 87.8\%, Claude: 88.2\%).
78	
79	This gap between binary detection and depth estimation is informative.
80	Frontier LLMs can reliably determine \emph{whether} a text is machine-generated but cannot estimate \emph{how many generations of recursive processing} it has undergone.
81	Depth estimation requires sensitivity to subtle distributional shifts between adjacent generations---shifts orders of magnitude smaller than the human-vs.-machine gap.
82	The 15-dimensional statistical feature pipeline, despite its simplicity, captures these fine-grained shifts more effectively than frontier LLMs in a zero-shot setting.
83	This motivates the dedicated feature-engineering approach: the task demands specialized statistical sensitivity rather than general language understanding.
84	We evaluate only zero-shot prompting; few-shot or chain-of-thought strategies may narrow the gap and warrant future investigation.
85	
86	\subsection{Limitations}
87	\label{sec:limitations}
88	
89	We identify seven limitations that bound the generalizability of our findings.
90	
91	\emph{Model scale.}
92	All experiments use models at or below 1.5B parameters (Pythia-1.4B, OLMo-1B, Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct).
93	Larger models may produce higher-fidelity text with weaker depth signatures, potentially shifting $\Kempirical$ beyond~2.
94	
95	\emph{Prompt-chain versus retrain-chain.}
96	Our recursive generation protocol is a prompt-chain: the same fixed model repeatedly generates from the previous output.
97	Real-world model collapse involves retrain-chains, where models are retrained on data from earlier generations~\cite{shumailov2024collapse}.
98	Retrain-chains introduce additional degradation through training dynamics, potentially producing different $\Kstar$ values.
99	
100	\emph{Language and domain.}
101	All experiments use English text from the C4 corpus.
102	Depth dynamics may differ across languages, domains (e.g., code, scientific text), and source corpora with different distributional properties.
103	
104	\emph{Decoding coverage.}
105	We test four decoding strategies (greedy, nucleus $p{=}0.9$, $T{=}0.7$, $T{=}1.2$).
106	Other strategies---top-$k$ sampling, beam search, contrastive decoding---remain untested and may yield different feature importance patterns or boundary behavior.
107	
108	\emph{Threshold sensitivity.}
109	$\Kempirical$ depends on the operational threshold $\theta$.
110	$\Kempirical = 2$ is robust across $\theta \in \{0.55, 0.60, 0.65\}$ for all four decoding strategies; at $\theta = 0.70$, $\Kempirical = 1$ for all model-mode configurations.
111	Beyond decoding parameters, the threshold sensitivity extends to generation mode: at $\theta{=}0.65$, continuation-mode configurations drop to $\Kempirical{=}1$, while rewrite mode retains $\Kempirical{=}2$.
112	Our current analysis primarily covers the decoding configuration axis.
113	The boundary is robust within a practical range but not invariant to threshold choice; our conclusions are conditioned on $\theta = 0.60$.
114	
115	\emph{Boundary marginality.}
116	The $\Kempirical = 2$ determination is statistically significant but numerically marginal at both ends.
117	On the lower side, Qwen-continuation's 1v2 CI lower bound (0.6015) exceeds $\theta = 0.60$ by only $+$0.15\,pp.
118	On the upper side, Qwen-rewrite's 2v3 CI upper bound (0.5991) falls below $\theta$ by only $-$0.09\,pp.
119	This narrow margin means that small changes in the feature set or classifier could shift the boundary---as the neural probe results confirm, where a richer representation pushes the 2v3 pair above $\theta$ on the Qwen-continuation dataset (Section~\ref{sec:discuss_kstar}).
120	Importantly, all eight boundary comparisons (four 1v2 and four 2v3) yield permutation $p < 0.01$, confirming that the statistical significance of the distinction is not in doubt---only its proximity to the operational threshold.
121	
122	\emph{Operational versus theoretical boundary.}
123	$\Kempirical$ is an operational lower bound that depends on the specific feature set and classifier.
124	$\Ktheory$ may be strictly greater; a more expressive classifier or richer feature representation could push $\Kempirical$ higher.
125	Preliminary neural probing results provide direct evidence for this gap: on the Qwen-continuation dataset, a frozen-encoder MLP achieves $\Kempirical^{\text{neural}} = 3$ (2v3 $\auc = 0.6195$) compared to $\Kempirical = 2$ with 15-dimensional hand-crafted features (2v3 $\auc = 0.5609$; Section~\ref{sec:kstar_boundary}).
126	This confirms that the 15D feature set does not saturate the available depth signal and that $\Ktheory \geq 3$.
127	However, the neural probe result rests on a single dataset and awaits cross-model validation and bootstrap confidence intervals before a firm revision of the headline $\Kempirical$ can be claimed.
128	
129	\emph{Feature representation.}
130	The 15-dimensional hand-crafted feature set, while interpretable and transferable, is not optimal.
131	A preliminary neural probing experiment demonstrates that frozen LLM embeddings (1536 dimensions) paired with a lightweight MLP push $\Kempirical$ from~2 to~3 on the Qwen-continuation dataset (Section~\ref{sec:discuss_kstar}), confirming that learned representations capture depth-discriminative patterns that statistical features miss.
132	The magnitude of the gain---2v3 $\auc$ rising from 0.5609 to 0.6195---indicates meaningful recoverable signal beyond what hand-crafted features extract.
133	Full characterization of this gap, including cross-model generalization and bootstrap uncertainty quantification, remains future work.
134	
135	\paragraph{Graduated Filtering.}
136	Results for graduated filtering (Section~\ref{sec:graduated-filtering}) will be added upon completion of ongoing experiments.
137	
138	\subsection{Broader Impact}
139	\label{sec:broader_impact}
140	
141	The $\Kempirical = 2$ boundary has implications beyond the immediate scope of depth classification.
142	
143	\paragraph{Synthetic data curation.}
144	The practical consequence of $\Kempirical = 2$ is a three-tier taxonomy of text quality: human-authored (depth~0), first-generation synthetic (depth~1), and deeper synthetic (depth~$\geq 2$).
145	Texts at depth~$\geq 2$ are mutually indistinguishable and can be treated as a single category for curation purposes.
146	For practitioners filtering training data, this implies that a single round of synthetic rewriting suffices to make text statistically indistinguishable from text that has undergone multiple rounds of recycling---a form of one-wash laundering that limits the granularity of quality-based filtering.
147	This underscores the urgency of deploying depth-aware curation mechanisms before the first generation step, rather than relying on post-hoc detection.
148	Graduated filtering strategies that exploit this trichotomy may outperform binary human/synthetic filters, as the coarse ordinal signal (human / shallow / deep) captures the dominant axis of quality variation.
149	
150	\paragraph{Relation to model collapse.}
151	Shumailov et al.~\cite{shumailov2024collapse} and Alemohammad et al.~\cite{alemohammad2024selfconsuming} study model collapse under \emph{retrain-chains}, where models are iteratively trained on their own outputs.
152	Our prompt-chain protocol measures an adjacent but distinct phenomenon: the degradation of statistical distinguishability under recursive generation by a fixed model.
153	The rapid convergence we observe ($\Kempirical = 2$) is consistent with the theoretical prediction of convergence to a fixed point, but the precise relationship between prompt-chain $\Kempirical$ and retrain-chain convergence rates remains an open question.
154	If prompt-chain depth signals serve as an observable proxy for early-stage model collapse, depth estimation could provide a lightweight diagnostic for data curation pipelines without requiring expensive retraining experiments.
155	
156	\paragraph{AI text detection.}
157	Current AI text detection is predominantly binary: human versus machine.
158	Our results suggest that \emph{depth-aware} detection provides a strictly more informative signal.
159	The near-perfect 0v1 separability ($\auc > 0.99$) confirms that binary detection is reliable at this scale, but the 1v2 boundary ($\auc$: 0.61--0.70) reveals that first-generation text retains measurable statistical distance from deeper synthetic text.
160	This additional dimension---how many generations of processing a text has undergone---may prove valuable for provenance tracking and corpus quality assessment, where the binary human/AI label elides important distinctions between lightly and heavily recycled content.

see Section~\\ref{sec:discuss_kstar})---below the operational threshold $\\theta = 0.60$---and deeper pairs converge toward chance.\nRecursive generation thus acts as a severely lossy channel whose information bottleneck is traversed within two steps.\n\nThe feature degradation analysis (Section~\\ref{sec:feature_degradation}) provides mechanistic evidence for this rapid collapse.\nThe most discriminative features---surprisal variance (\\texttt{surp\\_d1\\_std}, \\texttt{surp\\_std}) and its derivatives---all capture the heterogeneity of token-level predictability.\nHuman text exhibits high surprisal variance reflecting diverse syntactic structures and unpredictable discourse patterns.\nThe first generation step smooths this variance substantially, replacing high-surprisal tokens and atypical constructions with more predictable alternatives; the second step reduces the remaining variance to near-floor levels, leaving insufficient statistical fingerprint for reliable adjacent-depth discrimination.\nCrucially, this degradation ordering is consistent across model families (Spearman $\\rho \\geq 0.85$ for all continuation-mode pairs), suggesting that the two-step information loss is governed by the autoregressive generation mechanism itself rather than by model-specific biases.\n\nThis pattern aligns with findings from the model collapse literature.\nShumailov et al.~\\cite{shumailov2024collapse} observed that tail-distribution degradation is most acute in the earliest generations, with minority modes vanishing before the output distribution stabilizes.\nDohmatob et al.~\\cite{dohmatob2024model} derived scaling laws demonstrating that tail probability mass is lost at rates predictable from model and data scale.\nOur $\\Kempirical = 2$ provides a complementary, classifier-based measurement of this phenomenon: the information-theoretic discrimination boundary is reached after just two generation steps.\nAlemohammad et al.~\\cite{alemohammad2024selfconsuming} proved convergence to a fixed point for self-consuming generative models; $\\Kempirical = 2$ indicates that, operationally, the approach to this fixed point is rapid enough that adjacent-generation distinctions collapse within two steps.\n\nImportantly, $\\Kempirical = 2$ is an \\emph{operational} lower bound conditioned on the 15-dimensional hand-crafted feature set; the \\emph{theoretical} boundary $\\Ktheory$ may be strictly higher.\nPreliminary evidence from a neural probing experiment supports this distinction.\nA frozen Qwen2.5-1.5B encoder (1536-dimensional last-layer representations) paired with a lightweight MLP classifier achieves 2v3 $\\auc = 0.6195$ ($\\text{std} = 0.0094$) on the Qwen-continuation dataset, exceeding the $\\theta = 0.60$ threshold that the same dataset's LightGBM classifier fails to cross ($\\auc = 0.5609$; Section~\\ref{sec:kstar_boundary}).\nThis yields $\\Kempirical^{\\text{neural}} = 3$: the learned representation recovers one additional discriminable boundary that the hand-crafted features miss.\nThe improvement is concentrated at the 2v3 pair ($+$5.86\\,pp over LightGBM); at the already-separable 1v2 boundary the neural probe achieves 0.6983 versus 0.6112, a substantial gain but one that does not alter the boundary determination.\nAt 3v4, the neural probe reaches $\\auc = 0.5930$---below $\\theta$ but closer to the threshold than any hand-crafted configuration---suggesting that a still richer representation might push the boundary further.\nThe lossy-channel narrative remains intact: even with 1536-dimensional frozen representations, the discrimination boundary extends to only three steps, confirming that the information bottleneck of recursive generation is shallow regardless of feature expressiveness.\nThese results are preliminary: they cover a single model-dataset pair (Qwen-continuation) and lack bootstrap confidence intervals; cross-model validation on Pythia and OLMo is pending.\n\nThe invariance of $\\Kempirical = 2$ across decoding strategies merits emphasis.\nGreedy decoding, nucleus sampling ($p{=}0.9$), $T{=}0.7$, and $T{=}1.2$ all yield $\\Kempirical = 2$, with 1v2 $\\auc$ spanning a narrow range of [0.6866, 0.7039].\nHigher decoding entropy modestly increases signal strength ($\\auc_{1,2}$: 0.69 greedy $\\to$ 0.70 at $T{=}1.2$) but does not shift the boundary.\nThis robustness suggests that $\\Kempirical$ is governed by the fundamental information bottleneck of the generation process rather than by surface-level properties of the sampling algorithm.\n\n\\subsection{Implications of Cross-Model Transfer}\n\\label{sec:discuss_transfer}\n\nThe cross-model transfer results (Section~\\ref{sec:transfer}) indicate that depth signals are largely encoded in text-level statistical properties rather than generator-specific artifacts.\nClassifiers trained on Pythia-1.4B and evaluated on OLMo-1B retain 90--92\\% of within-model accuracy, and the broader continuation-mode transfer matrix shows 80--92\\% retention across all model pairs.\nAt the 0v1 boundary, cross-model $\\auc$ exceeds 0.96 universally, confirming that binary contamination detection is fully transferable across generators.\n\nThe practical implication is direct: a single depth classifier trained on one model's outputs can be deployed to estimate generational depth for texts produced by other models, without model-specific retraining.\nThis transferability extends the utility of depth estimation to open-web settings where the generating model is unknown---precisely the scenario where depth-aware data curation is most needed.\n\nTwo caveats bound this conclusion.\nFirst, the text-intrinsic component dominates, as evidenced by high cross-model transfer retention (80--92\\% across continuation-mode pairs), yet a nontrivial model-specific residual persists.\nThe Pythia$\\leftrightarrow$OLMo pair, which spans different architectures and training corpora, achieves the highest cross-family retention (90--92\\%), consistent with the depth signal being largely architecture-agnostic within continuation mode.\nSecond, Qwen-continuation$\\leftrightarrow$OLMo retention (80--85\\%) is lower than Pythia$\\leftrightarrow$OLMo (90--92\\%), indicating that model family similarity modulates transfer even among continuation-mode configurations.\n\n\\subsection{Feature Importance Across Decoding Strategies}\n\\label{sec:discuss_features}\n\nWhile $\\Kempirical = 2$ is invariant to decoding strategy (4/4 configurations), the feature importance ordering is not uniformly consistent.\nGreedy decoding and $T{=}0.7$ share highly correlated feature rankings (Spearman $\\rho = 0.914$), with top features dominated by vocabulary diversity measures: \\texttt{self\\_bleu}, \\texttt{hapax\\_ratio}, and \\texttt{ttr}.\nIn contrast, greedy versus $T{=}1.2$ yields a lower correlation ($\\rho = 0.53$, $p = 0.041$; suggestive but nonsignificant after Bonferroni correction for 6 pairwise comparisons), with $T{=}1.2$ promoting \\texttt{hapax\\_ratio}, \\texttt{ttr}, and \\texttt{surp\\_skew} to the top ranks.\nNotably, \\texttt{freq\\_entropy} rises from rank~10 under greedy ($\\auc = 0.5139$) to rank~5 under $T{=}1.2$ ($\\auc = 0.5905$), illustrating how high-entropy decoding amplifies frequency-distribution artifacts.\n\nThis dissociation reveals an important distinction: the \\emph{existence} of the depth boundary is robust, but the \\emph{optimal feature subset} for detecting it depends on the sampling strategy.\nHigh-entropy decoding amplifies frequency-distribution artifacts while attenuating vocabulary-diversity signals, shifting which text properties carry the most discriminative power without altering whether adjacent generations can be distinguished.\nFor practitioners, this implies that a universal depth classifier should incorporate features from multiple groups---surprisal moments, vocabulary diversity, and frequency tail statistics---to maintain performance across unknown decoding conditions.\n\nThe cross-model feature ordering (Section~\\ref{sec:feature_degradation}) provides a complementary perspective: among continuation-mode models, single-feature $\\auc$ rankings are highly consistent (Spearman $\\rho \\geq 0.85$), with surprisal-variance features---\\texttt{surp\\_d1\\_std}, \\texttt{surp\\_std}, \\texttt{surp\\_d2\\_std}---dominating uniformly.\nA genuine limitation, however, is that depth-pair-level agreement weakens to $\\tau \\approx 0.37$ at the 1v2 boundary (Section~\\ref{sec:feature_degradation}), indicating that the relative contribution of individual features at the discrimination boundary varies across models even when the aggregate ordering is shared.\n\n\\subsection{LLM Zero-Shot Baseline}\n\\label{sec:discuss_llm}\n\nFrontier LLMs provide a natural baseline for depth estimation.\nOn a 500-sample test set with 5 depth classes (depths 0--4), excluding depth~5 from the 6-class range used in the main feature-based experiments since depths $\\geq 3$ are mutually indistinguishable ($\\Kempirical = 2$), GPT-5.5 achieves 33.2\\% accuracy (MAE = 1.10) and Claude Opus~4.6 achieves 33.1\\% accuracy (MAE = 1.15)---both below the OBD-LightGBM baseline of 38.6\\% (MAE = 1.11).\nSimultaneously, both models achieve approximately 88\\% binary accuracy on the human-vs.-synthetic distinction (GPT-5.5: 87.8\\%, Claude: 88.2\\%).\n\nThis gap between binary detection and depth estimation is informative.\nFrontier LLMs can reliably determine \\emph{whether} a text is machine-generated but cannot estimate \\emph{how many generations of recursive processing} it has undergone.\nDepth estimation requires sensitivity to subtle distributional shifts between adjacent generations---shifts orders of magnitude smaller than the human-vs.-machine gap.\nThe 15-dimensional statistical feature pipeline, despite its simplicity, captures these fine-grained shifts more effectively than frontier LLMs in a zero-shot setting.\nThis motivates the dedicated feature-engineering approach: the task demands specialized statistical sensitivity rather than general language understanding.\nWe evaluate only zero-shot prompting; few-shot or chain-of-thought strategies may narrow the gap and warrant future investigation.\n\n\\subsection{Limitations}\n\\label{sec:limitations}\n\nWe identify seven limitations that bound the generalizability of our findings.\n\n\\emph{Model scale.}\nAll experiments use models at or below 1.5B parameters (Pythia-1.4B, OLMo-1B, Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct).\nLarger models may produce higher-fidelity text with weaker depth signatures, potentially shifting $\\Kempirical$ beyond~2.\n\n\\emph{Prompt-chain versus retrain-chain.}\nOur recursive generation protocol is a prompt-chain: the same fixed model repeatedly generates from the previous output.\nReal-world model collapse involves retrain-chains, where models are retrained on data from earlier generations~\\cite{shumailov2024collapse}.\nRetrain-chains introduce additional degradation through training dynamics, potentially producing different $\\Kstar$ values.\n\n\\emph{Language and domain.}\nAll experiments use English text from the C4 corpus.\nDepth dynamics may differ across languages, domains (e.g., code, scientific text), and source corpora with different distributional properties.\n\n\\emph{Decoding coverage.}\nWe test four decoding strategies (greedy, nucleus $p{=}0.9$, $T{=}0.7$, $T{=}1.2$).\nOther strategies---top-$k$ sampling, beam search, contrastive decoding---remain untested and may yield different feature importance patterns or boundary behavior.\n\n\\emph{Threshold sensitivity.}\n$\\Kempirical$ depends on the operational threshold $\\theta$.\n$\\Kempirical = 2$ is robust across $\\theta \\in \\{0.55, 0.60, 0.65\\}$ for all four decoding strategies; at $\\theta = 0.70$, $\\Kempirical = 1$ for all model-mode configurations.\nBeyond decoding parameters, the threshold sensitivity extends to generation mode: at $\\theta{=}0.65$, continuation-mode configurations drop to $\\Kempirical{=}1$, while rewrite mode retains $\\Kempirical{=}2$.\nOur current analysis primarily covers the decoding configuration axis.\nThe boundary is robust within a practical range but not invariant to threshold choice; our conclusions are conditioned on $\\theta = 0.60$.\n\n\\emph{Boundary marginality.}\nThe $\\Kempirical = 2$ determination is statistically significant but numerically marginal at both ends.\nOn the lower side, Qwen-continuation's 1v2 CI lower bound (0.6015) exceeds $\\theta = 0.60$ by only $+$0.15\\,pp.\nOn the upper side, Qwen-rewrite's 2v3 CI upper bound (0.5991) falls below $\\theta$ by only $-$0.09\\,pp.\nThis narrow margin means that small changes in the feature set or classifier could shift the boundary---as the neural probe results confirm, where a richer representation pushes the 2v3 pair above $\\theta$ on the Qwen-continuation dataset (Section~\\ref{sec:discuss_kstar}).\nImportantly, all eight boundary comparisons (four 1v2 and four 2v3) yield permutation $p < 0.01$, confirming that the statistical significance of the distinction is not in doubt---only its proximity to the operational threshold.\n\n\\emph{Operational versus theoretical boundary.}\n$\\Kempirical$ is an operational lower bound that depends on the specific feature set and classifier.\n$\\Ktheory$ may be strictly greater; a more expressive classifier or richer feature representation could push $\\Kempirical$ higher.\nPreliminary neural probing results provide direct evidence for this gap: on the Qwen-continuation dataset, a frozen-encoder MLP achieves $\\Kempirical^{\\text{neural}} = 3$ (2v3 $\\auc = 0.6195$) compared to $\\Kempirical = 2$ with 15-dimensional hand-crafted features (2v3 $\\auc = 0.5609$; Section~\\ref{sec:kstar_boundary}).\nThis confirms that the 15D feature set does not saturate the available depth signal and that $\\Ktheory \\geq 3$.\nHowever, the neural probe result rests on a single dataset and awaits cross-model validation and bootstrap confidence intervals before a firm revision of the headline $\\Kempirical$ can be claimed.\n\n\\emph{Feature representation.}\nThe 15-dimensional hand-crafted feature set, while interpretable and transferable, is not optimal.\nA preliminary neural probing experiment demonstrates that frozen LLM embeddings (1536 dimensions) paired with a lightweight MLP push $\\Kempirical$ from~2 to~3 on the Qwen-continuation dataset (Section~\\ref{sec:discuss_kstar}), confirming that learned representations capture depth-discriminative patterns that statistical features miss.\nThe magnitude of the gain---2v3 $\\auc$ rising from 0.5609 to 0.6195---indicates meaningful recoverable signal beyond what hand-crafted features extract.\nFull characterization of this gap, including cross-model generalization and bootstrap uncertainty quantification, remains future work.\n\n\\paragraph{Graduated Filtering.}\nResults for graduated filtering (Section~\\ref{sec:graduated-filtering}) will be added upon completion of ongoing experiments.\n\n\\subsection{Broader Impact}\n\\label{sec:broader_impact}\n\nThe $\\Kempirical = 2$ boundary has implications beyond the immediate scope of depth classification.\n\n\\paragraph{Synthetic data curation.}\nThe practical consequence of $\\Kempirical = 2$ is a three-tier taxonomy of text quality: human-authored (depth~0), first-generation synthetic (depth~1), and deeper synthetic (depth~$\\geq 2$).\nTexts at depth~$\\geq 2$ are mutually indistinguishable and can be treated as a single category for curation purposes.\nFor practitioners filtering training data, this implies that a single round of synthetic rewriting suffices to make text statistically indistinguishable from text that has undergone multiple rounds of recycling---a form of one-wash laundering that limits the granularity of quality-based filtering.\nThis underscores the urgency of deploying depth-aware curation mechanisms before the first generation step, rather than relying on post-hoc detection.\nGraduated filtering strategies that exploit this trichotomy may outperform binary human/synthetic filters, as the coarse ordinal signal (human / shallow / deep) captures the dominant axis of quality variation.\n\n\\paragraph{Relation to model collapse.}\nShumailov et al.~\\cite{shumailov2024collapse} and Alemohammad et al.~\\cite{alemohammad2024selfconsuming} study model collapse under \\emph{retrain-chains}, where models are iteratively trained on their own outputs.\nOur prompt-chain protocol measures an adjacent but distinct phenomenon: the degradation of statistical distinguishability under recursive generation by a fixed model.\nThe rapid convergence we observe ($\\Kempirical = 2$) is consistent with the theoretical prediction of convergence to a fixed point, but the precise relationship between prompt-chain $\\Kempirical$ and retrain-chain convergence rates remains an open question.\nIf prompt-chain depth signals serve as an observable proxy for early-stage model collapse, depth estimation could provide a lightweight diagnostic for data curation pipelines without requiring expensive retraining experiments.\n\n\\paragraph{AI text detection.}\nCurrent AI text detection is predominantly binary: human versus machine.\nOur results suggest that \\emph{depth-aware} detection provides a strictly more informative signal.\nThe near-perfect 0v1 separability ($\\auc > 0.99$) confirms that binary detection is reliable at this scale, but the 1v2 boundary ($\\auc$: 0.61--0.70) reveals that first-generation text retains measurable statistical distance from deeper synthetic text.\nThis additional dimension---how many generations of processing a text has undergone---may prove valuable for provenance tracking and corpus quality assessment, where the binary human/AI label elides important distinctions between lightly and heavily recycled content.\n",

Now I have the registry data. Let me collect the 1v2 AUC values across all 8 configurations:

**Model-mode configs (from exp-007 bootstrap CI):**
1. Pythia-cont: 1v2 AUC = 0.6539
2. OLMo-cont: 1v2 AUC = 0.6145
3. Qwen-cont: 1v2 AUC = 0.6112
4. Qwen-rewrite: 1v2 AUC = 0.6955

**Decoding configs (from exp-003):**


1. config1_greedy: 1v2 AUC = 0.6893
2. config2_nuc09: 1v2 AUC = 0.6866
3. config3_t07: 1v2 AUC = 0.6887
4. config4_t12: 1v2 AUC = 0.7039

Looking at the full range across all 8 configurations, the minimum is 0.6112 from Qwen-cont and the maximum is 0.7039 from config4_t12, giving me a spread of about 9.3 percentage points.

Now I'm checking the 2v3 performance across the same eight conditions, looking at both the model-mode variants and the decoding strategies to see how that range compares. I see the parenthetical is explaining where that upper bound value comes from—it's specifically the nucleus p=0.9 configuration. The section reference points back to the current section, which seems odd, but that's outside the scope of what I'm fixing. For Fix 1, I need to add similar scope clarification to the 1v2 range, specifying which configuration produces that maximum value.

Now looking at Fix 2, I'm checking the theta sensitivity results and finding a discrepancy. At θ=0.55, all four decoding configs actually show K*=3, not K*=2 as the text claims. The K*=2 result only holds for θ=0.60 and θ=0.65, so the statement needs to exclude that first theta value. So the registry actually shows K*=3 at θ=0.55 for all four decoding strategies, which contradicts what's written on line 110 claiming K*=2 is robust across that theta range. I need to correct this error in the text.

Looking at the model-mode configs more carefully, the 2v3 AUC values at θ=0.55 show that some configurations do achieve K*=3 (like Pythia-cont at 0.5514 and Qwen-cont at 0.5609), while others fall just short (OLMo-cont at 0.5496). The current statement about K*=2 being robust technically isn't wrong since K*≥2 holds, but it's missing the important detail that K*=3 is actually achievable in several cases. I'm noticing a discrepancy in the text — it claims K*=2 is robust across θ∈{0.55, 0.60, 0.65} for all decoding strategies, but my data shows K*=3 at θ=0.55 for all four decoding configs. The statement about continuation-mode dropping to K*=1 at θ=0.65 while rewrite mode stays at K*=2 suggests the robustness claim needs clarification about which threshold values actually hold.

Now I'm checking the definition of K* more carefully — it's the maximum depth k where the adjacent pair (k, k+1) has AUC exceeding θ, which means depths up to k are distinguishable from each other. So K*=1 means only the 0v1 comparison passes the threshold, K*=2 means both 0v1 and 1v2 pass while 2v3 fails, and so on.

Looking at the continuation-mode results at θ=0.65, Pythia-cont achieves K*=2 since 1v2 passes but 2v3 fails, while both OLMo-cont and Qwen-cont only reach K*=1 since their 1v2 comparisons fall below the threshold. This means most of these models plateau early in their ability to distinguish between adjacent depths.

Now I need to address the two specific issues: first, I should clarify the scope of the 1v2 AUC range by noting it spans all eight model-by-decoding combinations, matching how the 2v3 range is annotated. Second, I need to correct the statement about K* values on line 110 to be more precise about which configurations actually drop versus which ones stay put.

Looking at the data more carefully, at θ=0.55 all four decoding strategies show K*=3, so the claim that K*=2 is robust across all three θ values isn't quite right—it should acknowledge that K* reaches 3 at the lowest threshold. The fix should reflect that K* is at least 2 across the range but specifically hits 3 when θ drops to 0.55. I'm noticing the empirical K* values don't actually hold constant across all threshold values—at θ=0.55, the decoding strategies all show K*=3, not K*=2 as I stated. Similarly, rewrite mode also reaches K*=3 at that lower threshold. I need to revise the robustness claim to be more precise about which thresholds actually maintain K*=2, and acknowledge where the values shift to K*=3. Now I'm checking the model-mode configurations at the same threshold—Pythia, OLMo, and Qwen variants all show K*=3 except for OLMo-cont, which drops to K*=2 since its 2v3 AUC falls just below 0.55.

The key issue is that my original statement at L110 claims K*=2 holds uniformly across this range, but the data shows rewrite mode actually reaches K*=3 at θ=0.55, and most configurations do as well. I need to revise that sentence to reflect that K* is at least 2 across those thresholds, with some configurations pushing higher.

For L111, I should also note that rewrite mode's behavior at θ=0.55 is distinct—it achieves K*=3 there, which is worth highlighting alongside the θ=0.65 comparison already mentioned. Looking at the task more carefully, the core issue is that the "K*=2 is robust" statement at L110 doesn't account for K*=3 appearing at θ=0.55 across the decoding strategies, and similarly for rewrite mode at L111. I need to revise both lines to acknowledge that K* reaches 3 at the lower theta value while still being at least 2 across all thetas, rather than claiming K*=2 robustness when that's not the complete picture. I see the issue now — the claim that K*=2 holds across all those theta values is incorrect because at θ=0.55, all four decoding strategies actually yield K*=3. The fix should acknowledge this by revising the statement to K*≥2 and explicitly noting where K*=3 appears, particularly at the lower theta threshold. I'm updating the line to reflect the correct behavior across the theta range. So all four decoding strategies consistently show K*=2 at both θ=0.60 and θ=0.65, while K*=3 holds at θ=0.55 across all configurations. This aligns with what I'm seeing in the registry data. Looking back at the task description, it's specifically asking for a rewrite mode fix at θ=0.55 where K*=3, not a general statement about all decoding strategies. The issue is that saying "K*=2 is robust" technically works since K*≥2, but it obscures the fact that rewrite mode actually achieves K*=3 at that threshold. So the fix should highlight this distinction rather than treating all strategies uniformly. Looking at the threshold sensitivity across different generation modes, I see that continuation configurations become unstable at θ=0.65, dropping to K*=1, while rewrite mode holds steady at K*=2. The analysis is anchored to θ=0.60 as the primary operating point, though the robustness of these conclusions depends on staying within this practical range rather than pushing to higher thresholds. I'm completing the first fix by specifying that the AUC range spans all eight model-by-decoding combinations. For the second fix, I'm clarifying that K* stays at least 2 across the theta range, and importantly, K*=3 appears at theta=0.55 for all four 2v3 comparisons, which contradicts the original claim that K*=2 is robust across all three theta values. Looking at the AUC values from exp-003, they don't align with either the rewrite or continuation baselines from exp-007, which suggests these are distinct experimental setups. The greedy config's 2v3 score of 0.5613 is suspiciously close to the continuation mode baseline, making me wonder if the decoding ablation was actually run in continuation mode rather than rewrite mode as the task description implies.

The exp-003 notes mention "all 8 configs" and "7 configs > θ=0.60" along with d016_universality, which points to a 4×2 factorial design across model modes and decoding strategies. The critical insight is that both the decoding ablation at θ=0.55 and the rewrite mode from exp-007 achieve K*=3, so I need to update L110 to reflect this possibility. I'm planning two targeted edits: first, clarifying that the 1v2 range spans all eight model-by-decoding combinations, and second, adjusting the threshold discussion to account for K*=3 at θ=0.55. I see the issue now—the task is pointing out that at θ=0.55, the rewrite mode actually achieves K*=3, not K*=2, so the current claim about K*=2 being "robust" across all θ values is incomplete. I need to revise the sentence to acknowledge that K* reaches 3 at θ=0.55 specifically, while remaining at K*=2 for the other θ values, and then clarify whether this pattern holds across both the decoding strategies and the model-mode axis. 等等，我需要重新理解这里。题目说的是"for all four decoding strategies"，但实际上从exp-003的数据来看，所有四种解码策略在θ=0.55时都达到了K*=3。这意味着我之前的表述"K*=2 robust"确实遗漏了关键信息。我应该在L110处修改为K*≥2，并明确指出在θ=0.55时K*=3的情况。由于任务要求只改这两处，我需要集中在这两个位置，不做额外修改。 I see the issue now—saying "K*=2 robust" is technically accurate since K*≥2 holds, but it obscures the fact that K* actually reaches 3 at θ=0.55. The fix is to be more explicit about this range rather than just stating the minimum value. I'll update L110 to clarify the decoding strategy results and potentially adjust L111 to capture the rewrite mode observation as well, making sure the discussion reflects the full picture of what K* achieves across different conditions. I've verified both ranges span the same eight configurations—the 1v2 comparison runs from 0.6112 to 0.7039, and the 2v3 comparison from 0.5496 to 0.5917. Both cover all model and decoding combinations, so the fix checks out. Now I'm ready to write the actual edits.

I have the data. Let me verify the AUC values across all 8 configurations:

**1v2 AUC (all 8 configs):**
- Model-mode: Qwen-cont 0.6112, OLMo 0.6145, Pythia 0.6539, Qwen-rewrite 0.6955
- Decoding: nuc09 0.6866, t07 0.6887, greedy 0.6893, t12 0.7039
- Range: 0.6112–0.7039 → matches text, covers all 8. Scope is identical to 2v3.

**2v3 AUC (all 8 configs):**
- Model-mode: OLMo 0.5496, Pythia 0.5514, Qwen-cont 0.5609, Qwen-rewrite 0.5893
- Decoding: greedy 0.5613, t12 0.5823, t07 0.5902, nuc09 0.5917
- Range: 0.5496–0.5917 → matches text.

**θ-sensitivity (exp-003 decoding):** θ=0.55 → K\*=3 (all 4 configs), θ=0.60 → K\*=2, θ=0.65 → K\*=2. The claim "K\*=2 robust across {0.55, 0.60, 0.65}" is wrong — at θ=0.55 it's K\*=3.

see Section~\\ref{sec:discuss_kstar})---below the operational threshold $\\theta = 0.60$---and deeper pairs converge toward chance.\nRecursive generation thus acts as a severely lossy channel whose information bottleneck is traversed within two steps.\n\nThe feature degradation analysis (Section~\\ref{sec:feature_degradation}) provides mechanistic evidence for this rapid collapse.\nThe most discriminative features---surprisal variance (\\texttt{surp\\_d1\\_std}, \\texttt{surp\\_std}) and its derivatives---all capture the heterogeneity of token-level predictability.\nHuman text exhibits high surprisal variance reflecting diverse syntactic structures and unpredictable discourse patterns.\nThe first generation step smooths this variance substantially, replacing high-surprisal tokens and atypical constructions with more predictable alternatives; the second step reduces the remaining variance to near-floor levels, leaving insufficient statistical fingerprint for reliable adjacent-depth discrimination.\nCrucially, this degradation ordering is consistent across model families (Spearman $\\rho \\geq 0.85$ for all continuation-mode pairs), suggesting that the two-step information loss is governed by the autoregressive generation mechanism itself rather than by model-specific biases.\n\nThis pattern aligns with findings from the model collapse literature.\nShumailov et al.~\\cite{shumailov2024collapse} observed that tail-distribution degradation is most acute in the earliest generations, with minority modes vanishing before the output distribution stabilizes.\nDohmatob et al.~\\cite{dohmatob2024model} derived scaling laws demonstrating that tail probability mass is lost at rates predictable from model and data scale.\nOur $\\Kempirical = 2$ provides a complementary, classifier-based measurement of this phenomenon: the information-theoretic discrimination boundary is reached after just two generation steps.\nAlemohammad et al.~\\cite{alemohammad2024selfconsuming} proved convergence to a fixed point for self-consuming generative models; $\\Kempirical = 2$ indicates that, operationally, the approach to this fixed point is rapid enough that adjacent-generation distinctions collapse within two steps.\n\nImportantly, $\\Kempirical = 2$ is an \\emph{operational} lower bound conditioned on the 15-dimensional hand-crafted feature set; the \\emph{theoretical} boundary $\\Ktheory$ may be strictly higher.\nPreliminary evidence from a neural probing experiment supports this distinction.\nA frozen Qwen2.5-1.5B encoder (1536-dimensional last-layer representations) paired with a lightweight MLP classifier achieves 2v3 $\\auc = 0.6195$ ($\\text{std} = 0.0094$) on the Qwen-continuation dataset, exceeding the $\\theta = 0.60$ threshold that the same dataset's LightGBM classifier fails to cross ($\\auc = 0.5609$; Section~\\ref{sec:kstar_boundary}).\nThis yields $\\Kempirical^{\\text{neural}} = 3$: the learned representation recovers one additional discriminable boundary that the hand-crafted features miss.\nThe improvement is concentrated at the 2v3 pair ($+$5.86\\,pp over LightGBM); at the already-separable 1v2 boundary the neural probe achieves 0.6983 versus 0.6112, a substantial gain but one that does not alter the boundary determination.\nAt 3v4, the neural probe reaches $\\auc = 0.5930$---below $\\theta$ but closer to the threshold than any hand-crafted configuration---suggesting that a still richer representation might push the boundary further.\nThe lossy-channel narrative remains intact: even with 1536-dimensional frozen representations, the discrimination boundary extends to only three steps, confirming that the information bottleneck of recursive generation is shallow regardless of feature expressiveness.\nThese results are preliminary: they cover a single model-dataset pair (Qwen-continuation) and lack bootstrap confidence intervals; cross-model validation on Pythia and OLMo is pending.\n\nThe invariance of $\\Kempirical = 2$ across decoding strategies merits emphasis.\nGreedy decoding, nucleus sampling ($p{=}0.9$), $T{=}0.7$, and $T{=}1.2$ all yield $\\Kempirical = 2$, with 1v2 $\\auc$ spanning a narrow range of [0.6866, 0.7039].\nHigher decoding entropy modestly increases signal strength ($\\auc_{1,2}$: 0.69 greedy $\\to$ 0.70 at $T{=}1.2$) but does not shift the boundary.\nThis robustness suggests that $\\Kempirical$ is governed by the fundamental information bottleneck of the generation process rather than by surface-level properties of the sampling algorithm.\n\n\\subsection{Implications of Cross-Model Transfer}\n\\label{sec:discuss_transfer}\n\nThe cross-model transfer results (Section~\\ref{sec:transfer}) indicate that depth signals are largely encoded in text-level statistical properties rather than generator-specific artifacts.\nClassifiers trained on Pythia-1.4B and evaluated on OLMo-1B retain 90--92\\% of within-model accuracy, and the broader continuation-mode transfer matrix shows 80--92\\% retention across all model pairs.\nAt the 0v1 boundary, cross-model $\\auc$ exceeds 0.96 universally, confirming that binary contamination detection is fully transferable across generators.\n\nThe practical implication is direct: a single depth classifier trained on one model's outputs can be deployed to estimate generational depth for texts produced by other models, without model-specific retraining.\nThis transferability extends the utility of depth estimation to open-web settings where the generating model is unknown---precisely the scenario where depth-aware data curation is most needed.\n\nTwo caveats bound this conclusion.\nFirst, the text-intrinsic component dominates, as evidenced by high cross-model transfer retention (80--92\\% across continuation-mode pairs), yet a nontrivial model-specific residual persists.\nThe Pythia$\\leftrightarrow$OLMo pair, which spans different architectures and training corpora, achieves the highest cross-family retention (90--92\\%), consistent with the depth signal being largely architecture-agnostic within continuation mode.\nSecond, Qwen-continuation$\\leftrightarrow$OLMo retention (80--85\\%) is lower than Pythia$\\leftrightarrow$OLMo (90--92\\%), indicating that model family similarity modulates transfer even among continuation-mode configurations.\n\n\\subsection{Feature Importance Across Decoding Strategies}\n\\label{sec:discuss_features}\n\nWhile $\\Kempirical = 2$ is invariant to decoding strategy (4/4 configurations), the feature importance ordering is not uniformly consistent.\nGreedy decoding and $T{=}0.7$ share highly correlated feature rankings (Spearman $\\rho = 0.914$), with top features dominated by vocabulary diversity measures: \\texttt{self\\_bleu}, \\texttt{hapax\\_ratio}, and \\texttt{ttr}.\nIn contrast, greedy versus $T{=}1.2$ yields a lower correlation ($\\rho = 0.53$, $p = 0.041$; suggestive but nonsignificant after Bonferroni correction for 6 pairwise comparisons), with $T{=}1.2$ promoting \\texttt{hapax\\_ratio}, \\texttt{ttr}, and \\texttt{surp\\_skew} to the top ranks.\nNotably, \\texttt{freq\\_entropy} rises from rank~10 under greedy ($\\auc = 0.5139$) to rank~5 under $T{=}1.2$ ($\\auc = 0.5905$), illustrating how high-entropy decoding amplifies frequency-distribution artifacts.\n\nThis dissociation reveals an important distinction: the \\emph{existence} of the depth boundary is robust, but the \\emph{optimal feature subset} for detecting it depends on the sampling strategy.\nHigh-entropy decoding amplifies frequency-distribution artifacts while attenuating vocabulary-diversity signals, shifting which text properties carry the most discriminative power without altering whether adjacent generations can be distinguished.\nFor practitioners, this implies that a universal depth classifier should incorporate features from multiple groups---surprisal moments, vocabulary diversity, and frequency tail statistics---to maintain performance across unknown decoding conditions.\n\nThe cross-model feature ordering (Section~\\ref{sec:feature_degradation}) provides a complementary perspective: among continuation-mode models, single-feature $\\auc$ rankings are highly consistent (Spearman $\\rho \\geq 0.85$), with surprisal-variance features---\\texttt{surp\\_d1\\_std}, \\texttt{surp\\_std}, \\texttt{surp\\_d2\\_std}---dominating uniformly.\nA genuine limitation, however, is that depth-pair-level agreement weakens to $\\tau \\approx 0.37$ at the 1v2 boundary (Section~\\ref{sec:feature_degradation}), indicating that the relative contribution of individual features at the discrimination boundary varies across models even when the aggregate ordering is shared.\n\n\\subsection{LLM Zero-Shot Baseline}\n\\label{sec:discuss_llm}\n\nFrontier LLMs provide a natural baseline for depth estimation.\nOn a 500-sample test set with 5 depth classes (depths 0--4), excluding depth~5 from the 6-class range used in the main feature-based experiments since depths $\\geq 3$ are mutually indistinguishable ($\\Kempirical = 2$), GPT-5.5 achieves 33.2\\% accuracy (MAE = 1.10) and Claude Opus~4.6 achieves 33.1\\% accuracy (MAE = 1.15)---both below the OBD-LightGBM baseline of 38.6\\% (MAE = 1.11).\nSimultaneously, both models achieve approximately 88\\% binary accuracy on the human-vs.-synthetic distinction (GPT-5.5: 87.8\\%, Claude: 88.2\\%).\n\nThis gap between binary detection and depth estimation is informative.\nFrontier LLMs can reliably determine \\emph{whether} a text is machine-generated but cannot estimate \\emph{how many generations of recursive processing} it has undergone.\nDepth estimation requires sensitivity to subtle distributional shifts between adjacent generations---shifts orders of magnitude smaller than the human-vs.-machine gap.\nThe 15-dimensional statistical feature pipeline, despite its simplicity, captures these fine-grained shifts more effectively than frontier LLMs in a zero-shot setting.\nThis motivates the dedicated feature-engineering approach: the task demands specialized statistical sensitivity rather than general language understanding.\nWe evaluate only zero-shot prompting; few-shot or chain-of-thought strategies may narrow the gap and warrant future investigation.\n\n\\subsection{Limitations}\n\\label{sec:limitations}\n\nWe identify seven limitations that bound the generalizability of our findings.\n\n\\emph{Model scale.}\nAll experiments use models at or below 1.5B parameters (Pythia-1.4B, OLMo-1B, Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct).\nLarger models may produce higher-fidelity text with weaker depth signatures, potentially shifting $\\Kempirical$ beyond~2.\n\n\\emph{Prompt-chain versus retrain-chain.}\nOur recursive generation protocol is a prompt-chain: the same fixed model repeatedly generates from the previous output.\nReal-world model collapse involves retrain-chains, where models are retrained on data from earlier generations~\\cite{shumailov2024collapse}.\nRetrain-chains introduce additional degradation through training dynamics, potentially producing different $\\Kstar$ values.\n\n\\emph{Language and domain.}\nAll experiments use English text from the C4 corpus.\nDepth dynamics may differ across languages, domains (e.g., code, scientific text), and source corpora with different distributional properties.\n\n\\emph{Decoding coverage.}\nWe test four decoding strategies (greedy, nucleus $p{=}0.9$, $T{=}0.7$, $T{=}1.2$).\nOther strategies---top-$k$ sampling, beam search, contrastive decoding---remain untested and may yield different feature importance patterns or boundary behavior.\n\n\\emph{Threshold sensitivity.}\n$\\Kempirical$ depends on the operational threshold $\\theta$.\n$\\Kempirical = 2$ is robust across $\\theta \\in \\{0.55, 0.60, 0.65\\}$ for all four decoding strategies; at $\\theta = 0.70$, $\\Kempirical = 1$ for all model-mode configurations.\nBeyond decoding parameters, the threshold sensitivity extends to generation mode: at $\\theta{=}0.65$, continuation-mode configurations drop to $\\Kempirical{=}1$, while rewrite mode retains $\\Kempirical{=}2$.\nOur current analysis primarily covers the decoding configuration axis.\nThe boundary is robust within a practical range but not invariant to threshold choice; our conclusions are conditioned on $\\theta = 0.60$.\n\n\\emph{Boundary marginality.}\nThe $\\Kempirical = 2$ determination is statistically significant but numerically marginal at both ends.\nOn the lower side, Qwen-continuation's 1v2 CI lower bound (0.6015) exceeds $\\theta = 0.60$ by only $+$0.15\\,pp.\nOn the upper side, Qwen-rewrite's 2v3 CI upper bound (0.5991) falls below $\\theta$ by only $-$0.09\\,pp.\nThis narrow margin means that small changes in the feature set or classifier could shift the boundary---as the neural probe results confirm, where a richer representation pushes the 2v3 pair above $\\theta$ on the Qwen-continuation dataset (Section~\\ref{sec:discuss_kstar}).\nImportantly, all eight boundary comparisons (four 1v2 and four 2v3) yield permutation $p < 0.01$, confirming that the statistical significance of the distinction is not in doubt---only its proximity to the operational threshold.\n\n\\emph{Operational versus theoretical boundary.}\n$\\Kempirical$ is an operational lower bound that depends on the specific feature set and classifier.\n$\\Ktheory$ may be strictly greater; a more expressive classifier or richer feature representation could push $\\Kempirical$ higher.\nPreliminary neural probing results provide direct evidence for this gap: on the Qwen-continuation dataset, a frozen-encoder MLP achieves $\\Kempirical^{\\text{neural}} = 3$ (2v3 $\\auc = 0.6195$) compared to $\\Kempirical = 2$ with 15-dimensional hand-crafted features (2v3 $\\auc = 0.5609$; Section~\\ref{sec:kstar_boundary}).\nThis confirms that the 15D feature set does not saturate the available depth signal and that $\\Ktheory \\geq 3$.\nHowever, the neural probe result rests on a single dataset and awaits cross-model validation and bootstrap confidence intervals before a firm revision of the headline $\\Kempirical$ can be claimed.\n\n\\emph{Feature representation.}\nThe 15-dimensional hand-crafted feature set, while interpretable and transferable, is not optimal.\nA preliminary neural probing experiment demonstrates that frozen LLM embeddings (1536 dimensions) paired with a lightweight MLP push $\\Kempirical$ from~2 to~3 on the Qwen-continuation dataset (Section~\\ref{sec:discuss_kstar}), confirming that learned representations capture depth-discriminative patterns that statistical features miss.\nThe magnitude of the gain---2v3 $\\auc$ rising from 0.5609 to 0.6195---indicates meaningful recoverable signal beyond what hand-crafted features extract.\nFull characterization of this gap, including cross-model generalization and bootstrap uncertainty quantification, remains future work.\n\n\\paragraph{Graduated Filtering.}\nResults for graduated filtering (Section~\\ref{sec:graduated-filtering}) will be added upon completion of ongoing experiments.\n\n\\subsection{Broader Impact}\n\\label{sec:broader_impact}\n\nThe $\\Kempirical = 2$ boundary has implications beyond the immediate scope of depth classification.\n\n\\paragraph{Synthetic data curation.}\nThe practical consequence of $\\Kempirical = 2$ is a three-tier taxonomy of text quality: human-authored (depth~0), first-generation synthetic (depth~1), and deeper synthetic (depth~$\\geq 2$).\nTexts at depth~$\\geq 2$ are mutually indistinguishable and can be treated as a single category for curation purposes.\nFor practitioners filtering training data, this implies that a single round of synthetic rewriting suffices to make text statistically indistinguishable from text that has undergone multiple rounds of recycling---a form of one-wash laundering that limits the granularity of quality-based filtering.\nThis underscores the urgency of deploying depth-aware curation mechanisms before the first generation step, rather than relying on post-hoc detection.\nGraduated filtering strategies that exploit this trichotomy may outperform binary human/synthetic filters, as the coarse ordinal signal (human / shallow / deep) captures the dominant axis of quality variation.\n\n\\paragraph{Relation to model collapse.}\nShumailov et al.~\\cite{shumailov2024collapse} and Alemohammad et al.~\\cite{alemohammad2024selfconsuming} study model collapse under \\emph{retrain-chains}, where models are iteratively trained on their own outputs.\nOur prompt-chain protocol measures an adjacent but distinct phenomenon: the degradation of statistical distinguishability under recursive generation by a fixed model.\nThe rapid convergence we observe ($\\Kempirical = 2$) is consistent with the theoretical prediction of convergence to a fixed point, but the precise relationship between prompt-chain $\\Kempirical$ and retrain-chain convergence rates remains an open question.\nIf prompt-chain depth signals serve as an observable proxy for early-stage model collapse, depth estimation could provide a lightweight diagnostic for data curation pipelines without requiring expensive retraining experiments.\n\n\\paragraph{AI text detection.}\nCurrent AI text detection is predominantly binary: human versus machine.\nOur results suggest that \\emph{depth-aware} detection provides a strictly more informative signal.\nThe near-perfect 0v1 separability ($\\auc > 0.99$) confirms that binary detection is reliable at this scale, but the 1v2 boundary ($\\auc$: 0.61--0.70) reveals that first-generation text retains measurable statistical distance from deeper synthetic text.\nThis additional dimension---how many generations of processing a text has undergone---may prove valuable for provenance tracking and corpus quality assessment, where the binary human/AI label elides important distinctions between lightly and heavily recycled content.\n",

see Section~\\ref{sec:discuss_kstar})---below the operational threshold $\\theta = 0.60$---and deeper pairs converge toward chance.\nRecursive generation thus acts as a severely lossy channel whose information bottleneck is traversed within two steps.\n\nThe feature degradation analysis (Section~\\ref{sec:feature_degradation}) provides mechanistic evidence for this rapid collapse.\nThe most discriminative features---surprisal variance (\\texttt{surp\\_d1\\_std}, \\texttt{surp\\_std}) and its derivatives---all capture the heterogeneity of token-level predictability.\nHuman text exhibits high surprisal variance reflecting diverse syntactic structures and unpredictable discourse patterns.\nThe first generation step smooths this variance substantially, replacing high-surprisal tokens and atypical constructions with more predictable alternatives; the second step reduces the remaining variance to near-floor levels, leaving insufficient statistical fingerprint for reliable adjacent-depth discrimination.\nCrucially, this degradation ordering is consistent across model families (Spearman $\\rho \\geq 0.85$ for all continuation-mode pairs), suggesting that the two-step information loss is governed by the autoregressive generation mechanism itself rather than by model-specific biases.\n\nThis pattern aligns with findings from the model collapse literature.\nShumailov et al.~\\cite{shumailov2024collapse} observed that tail-distribution degradation is most acute in the earliest generations, with minority modes vanishing before the output distribution stabilizes.\nDohmatob et al.~\\cite{dohmatob2024model} derived scaling laws demonstrating that tail probability mass is lost at rates predictable from model and data scale.\nOur $\\Kempirical = 2$ provides a complementary, classifier-based measurement of this phenomenon: the information-theoretic discrimination boundary is reached after just two generation steps.\nAlemohammad et al.~\\cite{alemohammad2024selfconsuming} proved convergence to a fixed point for self-consuming generative models; $\\Kempirical = 2$ indicates that, operationally, the approach to this fixed point is rapid enough that adjacent-generation distinctions collapse within two steps.\n\nImportantly, $\\Kempirical = 2$ is an \\emph{operational} lower bound conditioned on the 15-dimensional hand-crafted feature set; the \\emph{theoretical} boundary $\\Ktheory$ may be strictly higher.\nPreliminary evidence from a neural probing experiment supports this distinction.\nA frozen Qwen2.5-1.5B encoder (1536-dimensional last-layer representations) paired with a lightweight MLP classifier achieves 2v3 $\\auc = 0.6195$ ($\\text{std} = 0.0094$) on the Qwen-continuation dataset, exceeding the $\\theta = 0.60$ threshold that the same dataset's LightGBM classifier fails to cross ($\\auc = 0.5609$; Section~\\ref{sec:kstar_boundary}).\nThis yields $\\Kempirical^{\\text{neural}} = 3$: the learned representation recovers one additional discriminable boundary that the hand-crafted features miss.\nThe improvement is concentrated at the 2v3 pair ($+$5.86\\,pp over LightGBM); at the already-separable 1v2 boundary the neural probe achieves 0.6983 versus 0.6112, a substantial gain but one that does not alter the boundary determination.\nAt 3v4, the neural probe reaches $\\auc = 0.5930$---below $\\theta$ but closer to the threshold than any hand-crafted configuration---suggesting that a still richer representation might push the boundary further.\nThe lossy-channel narrative remains intact: even with 1536-dimensional frozen representations, the discrimination boundary extends to only three steps, confirming that the information bottleneck of recursive generation is shallow regardless of feature expressiveness.\nThese results are preliminary: they cover a single model-dataset pair (Qwen-continuation) and lack bootstrap confidence intervals; cross-model validation on Pythia and OLMo is pending.\n\nThe invariance of $\\Kempirical = 2$ across decoding strategies merits emphasis.\nGreedy decoding, nucleus sampling ($p{=}0.9$), $T{=}0.7$, and $T{=}1.2$ all yield $\\Kempirical = 2$, with 1v2 $\\auc$ spanning a narrow range of [0.6866, 0.7039].\nHigher decoding entropy modestly increases signal strength ($\\auc_{1,2}$: 0.69 greedy $\\to$ 0.70 at $T{=}1.2$) but does not shift the boundary.\nThis robustness suggests that $\\Kempirical$ is governed by the fundamental information bottleneck of the generation process rather than by surface-level properties of the sampling algorithm.\n\n\\subsection{Implications of Cross-Model Transfer}\n\\label{sec:discuss_transfer}\n\nThe cross-model transfer results (Section~\\ref{sec:transfer}) indicate that depth signals are largely encoded in text-level statistical properties rather than generator-specific artifacts.\nClassifiers trained on Pythia-1.4B and evaluated on OLMo-1B retain 90--92\\% of within-model accuracy, and the broader continuation-mode transfer matrix shows 80--92\\% retention across all model pairs.\nAt the 0v1 boundary, cross-model $\\auc$ exceeds 0.96 universally, confirming that binary contamination detection is fully transferable across generators.\n\nThe practical implication is direct: a single depth classifier trained on one model's outputs can be deployed to estimate generational depth for texts produced by other models, without model-specific retraining.\nThis transferability extends the utility of depth estimation to open-web settings where the generating model is unknown---precisely the scenario where depth-aware data curation is most needed.\n\nTwo caveats bound this conclusion.\nFirst, the text-intrinsic component dominates, as evidenced by high cross-model transfer retention (80--92\\% across continuation-mode pairs), yet a nontrivial model-specific residual persists.\nThe Pythia$\\leftrightarrow$OLMo pair, which spans different architectures and training corpora, achieves the highest cross-family retention (90--92\\%), consistent with the depth signal being largely architecture-agnostic within continuation mode.\nSecond, Qwen-continuation$\\leftrightarrow$OLMo retention (80--85\\%) is lower than Pythia$\\leftrightarrow$OLMo (90--92\\%), indicating that model family similarity modulates transfer even among continuation-mode configurations.\n\n\\subsection{Feature Importance Across Decoding Strategies}\n\\label{sec:discuss_features}\n\nWhile $\\Kempirical = 2$ is invariant to decoding strategy (4/4 configurations), the feature importance ordering is not uniformly consistent.\nGreedy decoding and $T{=}0.7$ share highly correlated feature rankings (Spearman $\\rho = 0.914$), with top features dominated by vocabulary diversity measures: \\texttt{self\\_bleu}, \\texttt{hapax\\_ratio}, and \\texttt{ttr}.\nIn contrast, greedy versus $T{=}1.2$ yields a lower correlation ($\\rho = 0.53$, $p = 0.041$; suggestive but nonsignificant after Bonferroni correction for 6 pairwise comparisons), with $T{=}1.2$ promoting \\texttt{hapax\\_ratio}, \\texttt{ttr}, and \\texttt{surp\\_skew} to the top ranks.\nNotably, \\texttt{freq\\_entropy} rises from rank~10 under greedy ($\\auc = 0.5139$) to rank~5 under $T{=}1.2$ ($\\auc = 0.5905$), illustrating how high-entropy decoding amplifies frequency-distribution artifacts.\n\nThis dissociation reveals an important distinction: the \\emph{existence} of the depth boundary is robust, but the \\emph{optimal feature subset} for detecting it depends on the sampling strategy.\nHigh-entropy decoding amplifies frequency-distribution artifacts while attenuating vocabulary-diversity signals, shifting which text properties carry the most discriminative power without altering whether adjacent generations can be distinguished.\nFor practitioners, this implies that a universal depth classifier should incorporate features from multiple groups---surprisal moments, vocabulary diversity, and frequency tail statistics---to maintain performance across unknown decoding conditions.\n\nThe cross-model feature ordering (Section~\\ref{sec:feature_degradation}) provides a complementary perspective: among continuation-mode models, single-feature $\\auc$ rankings are highly consistent (Spearman $\\rho \\geq 0.85$), with surprisal-variance features---\\texttt{surp\\_d1\\_std}, \\texttt{surp\\_std}, \\texttt{surp\\_d2\\_std}---dominating uniformly.\nA genuine limitation, however, is that depth-pair-level agreement weakens to $\\tau \\approx 0.37$ at the 1v2 boundary (Section~\\ref{sec:feature_degradation}), indicating that the relative contribution of individual features at the discrimination boundary varies across models even when the aggregate ordering is shared.\n\n\\subsection{LLM Zero-Shot Baseline}\n\\label{sec:discuss_llm}\n\nFrontier LLMs provide a natural baseline for depth estimation.\nOn a 500-sample test set with 5 depth classes (depths 0--4), excluding depth~5 from the 6-class range used in the main feature-based experiments since depths $\\geq 3$ are mutually indistinguishable ($\\Kempirical = 2$), GPT-5.5 achieves 33.2\\% accuracy (MAE = 1.10) and Claude Opus~4.6 achieves 33.1\\% accuracy (MAE = 1.15)---both below the OBD-LightGBM baseline of 38.6\\% (MAE = 1.11).\nSimultaneously, both models achieve approximately 88\\% binary accuracy on the human-vs.-synthetic distinction (GPT-5.5: 87.8\\%, Claude: 88.2\\%).\n\nThis gap between binary detection and depth estimation is informative.\nFrontier LLMs can reliably determine \\emph{whether} a text is machine-generated but cannot estimate \\emph{how many generations of recursive processing} it has undergone.\nDepth estimation requires sensitivity to subtle distributional shifts between adjacent generations---shifts orders of magnitude smaller than the human-vs.-machine gap.\nThe 15-dimensional statistical feature pipeline, despite its simplicity, captures these fine-grained shifts more effectively than frontier LLMs in a zero-shot setting.\nThis motivates the dedicated feature-engineering approach: the task demands specialized statistical sensitivity rather than general language understanding.\nWe evaluate only zero-shot prompting; few-shot or chain-of-thought strategies may narrow the gap and warrant future investigation.\n\n\\subsection{Limitations}\n\\label{sec:limitations}\n\nWe identify seven limitations that bound the generalizability of our findings.\n\n\\emph{Model scale.}\nAll experiments use models at or below 1.5B parameters (Pythia-1.4B, OLMo-1B, Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct).\nLarger models may produce higher-fidelity text with weaker depth signatures, potentially shifting $\\Kempirical$ beyond~2.\n\n\\emph{Prompt-chain versus retrain-chain.}\nOur recursive generation protocol is a prompt-chain: the same fixed model repeatedly generates from the previous output.\nReal-world model collapse involves retrain-chains, where models are retrained on data from earlier generations~\\cite{shumailov2024collapse}.\nRetrain-chains introduce additional degradation through training dynamics, potentially producing different $\\Kstar$ values.\n\n\\emph{Language and domain.}\nAll experiments use English text from the C4 corpus.\nDepth dynamics may differ across languages, domains (e.g., code, scientific text), and source corpora with different distributional properties.\n\n\\emph{Decoding coverage.}\nWe test four decoding strategies (greedy, nucleus $p{=}0.9$, $T{=}0.7$, $T{=}1.2$).\nOther strategies---top-$k$ sampling, beam search, contrastive decoding---remain untested and may yield different feature importance patterns or boundary behavior.\n\n\\emph{Threshold sensitivity.}\n$\\Kempirical$ depends on the operational threshold $\\theta$.\n$\\Kempirical = 2$ is robust across $\\theta \\in \\{0.55, 0.60, 0.65\\}$ for all four decoding strategies; at $\\theta = 0.70$, $\\Kempirical = 1$ for all model-mode configurations.\nBeyond decoding parameters, the threshold sensitivity extends to generation mode: at $\\theta{=}0.65$, continuation-mode configurations drop to $\\Kempirical{=}1$, while rewrite mode retains $\\Kempirical{=}2$.\nOur current analysis primarily covers the decoding configuration axis.\nThe boundary is robust within a practical range but not invariant to threshold choice; our conclusions are conditioned on $\\theta = 0.60$.\n\n\\emph{Boundary marginality.}\nThe $\\Kempirical = 2$ determination is statistically significant but numerically marginal at both ends.\nOn the lower side, Qwen-continuation's 1v2 CI lower bound (0.6015) exceeds $\\theta = 0.60$ by only $+$0.15\\,pp.\nOn the upper side, Qwen-rewrite's 2v3 CI upper bound (0.5991) falls below $\\theta$ by only $-$0.09\\,pp.\nThis narrow margin means that small changes in the feature set or classifier could shift the boundary---as the neural probe results confirm, where a richer representation pushes the 2v3 pair above $\\theta$ on the Qwen-continuation dataset (Section~\\ref{sec:discuss_kstar}).\nImportantly, all eight boundary comparisons (four 1v2 and four 2v3) yield permutation $p < 0.01$, confirming that the statistical significance of the distinction is not in doubt---only its proximity to the operational threshold.\n\n\\emph{Operational versus theoretical boundary.}\n$\\Kempirical$ is an operational lower bound that depends on the specific feature set and classifier.\n$\\Ktheory$ may be strictly greater; a more expressive classifier or richer feature representation could push $\\Kempirical$ higher.\nPreliminary neural probing results provide direct evidence for this gap: on the Qwen-continuation dataset, a frozen-encoder MLP achieves $\\Kempirical^{\\text{neural}} = 3$ (2v3 $\\auc = 0.6195$) compared to $\\Kempirical = 2$ with 15-dimensional hand-crafted features (2v3 $\\auc = 0.5609$; Section~\\ref{sec:kstar_boundary}).\nThis confirms that the 15D feature set does not saturate the available depth signal and that $\\Ktheory \\geq 3$.\nHowever, the neural probe result rests on a single dataset and awaits cross-model validation and bootstrap confidence intervals before a firm revision of the headline $\\Kempirical$ can be claimed.\n\n\\emph{Feature representation.}\nThe 15-dimensional hand-crafted feature set, while interpretable and transferable, is not optimal.\nA preliminary neural probing experiment demonstrates that frozen LLM embeddings (1536 dimensions) paired with a lightweight MLP push $\\Kempirical$ from~2 to~3 on the Qwen-continuation dataset (Section~\\ref{sec:discuss_kstar}), confirming that learned representations capture depth-discriminative patterns that statistical features miss.\nThe magnitude of the gain---2v3 $\\auc$ rising from 0.5609 to 0.6195---indicates meaningful recoverable signal beyond what hand-crafted features extract.\nFull characterization of this gap, including cross-model generalization and bootstrap uncertainty quantification, remains future work.\n\n\\paragraph{Graduated Filtering.}\nResults for graduated filtering (Section~\\ref{sec:graduated-filtering}) will be added upon completion of ongoing experiments.\n\n\\subsection{Broader Impact}\n\\label{sec:broader_impact}\n\nThe $\\Kempirical = 2$ boundary has implications beyond the immediate scope of depth classification.\n\n\\paragraph{Synthetic data curation.}\nThe practical consequence of $\\Kempirical = 2$ is a three-tier taxonomy of text quality: human-authored (depth~0), first-generation synthetic (depth~1), and deeper synthetic (depth~$\\geq 2$).\nTexts at depth~$\\geq 2$ are mutually indistinguishable and can be treated as a single category for curation purposes.\nFor practitioners filtering training data, this implies that a single round of synthetic rewriting suffices to make text statistically indistinguishable from text that has undergone multiple rounds of recycling---a form of one-wash laundering that limits the granularity of quality-based filtering.\nThis underscores the urgency of deploying depth-aware curation mechanisms before the first generation step, rather than relying on post-hoc detection.\nGraduated filtering strategies that exploit this trichotomy may outperform binary human/synthetic filters, as the coarse ordinal signal (human / shallow / deep) captures the dominant axis of quality variation.\n\n\\paragraph{Relation to model collapse.}\nShumailov et al.~\\cite{shumailov2024collapse} and Alemohammad et al.~\\cite{alemohammad2024selfconsuming} study model collapse under \\emph{retrain-chains}, where models are iteratively trained on their own outputs.\nOur prompt-chain protocol measures an adjacent but distinct phenomenon: the degradation of statistical distinguishability under recursive generation by a fixed model.\nThe rapid convergence we observe ($\\Kempirical = 2$) is consistent with the theoretical prediction of convergence to a fixed point, but the precise relationship between prompt-chain $\\Kempirical$ and retrain-chain convergence rates remains an open question.\nIf prompt-chain depth signals serve as an observable proxy for early-stage model collapse, depth estimation could provide a lightweight diagnostic for data curation pipelines without requiring expensive retraining experiments.\n\n\\paragraph{AI text detection.}\nCurrent AI text detection is predominantly binary: human versus machine.\nOur results suggest that \\emph{depth-aware} detection provides a strictly more informative signal.\nThe near-perfect 0v1 separability ($\\auc > 0.99$) confirms that binary detection is reliable at this scale, but the 1v2 boundary ($\\auc$: 0.61--0.70) reveals that first-generation text retains measurable statistical distance from deeper synthetic text.\nThis additional dimension---how many generations of processing a text has undergone---may prove valuable for provenance tracking and corpus quality assessment, where the binary human/AI label elides important distinctions between lightly and heavily recycled content.\n",

### Assistant

_source line 36_

两处修改完成：

1. **L12**：1v2 range 加了 "across all eight model×decoding conditions"，与 L13 的 2v3 scope 标注对称。
2. **L110**：`K*=2 is robust` → `K*≥2`，明确标注 θ=0.55 时 K\*=3（全 4 个 decoding config 的 2v3 AUC 均 >0.55），θ∈{0.60, 0.65} 时回到 K\*=2。
