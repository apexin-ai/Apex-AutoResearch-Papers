Interesting findings:

1. The main log `/root/autodl-tmp/gen-depth-contamination/logs/exp_018_llama8b.log` actually shows a **successful completion** — not a failure. The log ends with "Pipeline complete." and shows full results of an "MVP Pilot Saturation Study."

2. The `tmux ls` command was blocked because of the `2>/dev/null` redirect. Let me try without it.

3. The registry has no entry for `exp_018_llama8b_depth` — 0 results returned.

Wait, looking at the log more carefully — this doesn't look like a LLaMA 8B training run at all. 

The output is actually from a feature saturation analysis using LightGBM, showing pairwise AUC scores between adjacent depths that drop off sharply after the initial comparison, JSD divergence metrics, and a K* value of 2 indicating the maximum useful depth. The experiment appears to have run to completion, so I should check whether the registry might have it under a different name or look for any error logs that might explain why this wasn't the expected result.

```text
Now I have the picture. The registry shows `exp_018_llama8b_depth` with:
- status: "DONE"
- conclusion: "failed"
- failure_reason: "process dead 5× with no sentinel/W&B — auto-resolved as failed"

But the log file `/root/autodl-tmp/gen-depth-contamination/logs/exp_018_llama8b.log` shows the pipeline completed successfully with results! It shows "Pipeline complete." at the end with full K*=2 results.

So the situation is: the experiment actually **completed successfully** but was auto-marked as failed by the monitoring system (which checks for process liveness and sentinel/W&B signals 5 times and gave up).


The results are solid—AUC(0 vs 1) hit 0.9225, AUC(1 vs 2) cleared the 0.60 threshold at 0.6123, and the pipeline determined K*=2 before finishing. The whole run took about 10.64 hours according to the registry timestamps.

The timezone mismatch explains the discrepancy: the server's running on UTC+8, so those 23:27 log entries correspond to the 15:35 UTC finish time in the registry. The monitoring cron likely checked the process, found it already dead from natural completion, but without a sentinel file or W&B confirmation signal, it incorrectly flagged the experiment as failed after multiple checks. The experiment actually succeeded—I should verify the outputs are in the results directory to confirm.

Now I have a clear picture. The experiment actually **completed successfully**:

1. Log starts at 13:01:09 (server local time), loads LLaMA-3.1-8B, generates depth chain, runs feature extraction and analysis
2. Log ends at 23:27:38 with "Pipeline complete." and full results showing K*=2
3. Results directory has all output files (feature_importance.json, jsd.json, ordinal_results.json, pairwise_auc.json, summary.txt)

But the registry has `conclusion: "failed"` with `failure_reason: "process dead 5× with no sentinel/W&B — auto-resolved as failed"`.


The cron monitoring system mistakenly flagged this as a failure—it checked the PID after the process had already finished and, without a sentinel file or W&B confirmation, marked it as failed after 5 checks. The actual results show K*=2 confirming cross-family universality, with AUC scores of 0.9225, 0.6123, 0.5274, 0.5169, and 0.5162 across the pairwise comparisons.

The top features driving these results are surp_d1_skew, freq_entropy, and surp_d2_mean. I should update the registry notes to document this diagnosis.

诊断完成。实验实际**成功完成**，是被 cron 监控误判为 failed。

证据：
- 日志末尾显示 `Pipeline complete.`，有完整结果（K*=2）
- `results/exp_018_llama8b/` 目录有全部产出文件（5 个 json/txt）
- 失败原因是：进程正常退出后，监控 cron 检查 PID 10403 发现进程不存在，又没有 sentinel 文件/W&B 信号确认成功，5 次检查后自动标记 failed

更新 registry：

### Assistant

_source line 33_

诊断结果：

**exp_018_llama8b_depth 未失败，是误报。** 实验已成功完成，被 cron 监控误判。

| 项目 | 详情 |
|------|------|
| 根因 | 进程正常退出后 PID 消失，无 sentinel/W&B 确认机制，cron 5× 检测到 dead 后 auto-mark failed |
| 实际结果 | K*=2, AUC(1v2)=0.6123, Pipeline complete |
| 产出 | `results/exp_018_llama8b/` 有 5 个完整结果文件 |
| 运行时长 | ~10.4h (13:01→23:27 服务器本地时间) |

Registry notes 已更新。建议后续将 conclusion 改为 success 并补录 metrics。
