This page is a human-readable rendering of one source record. It preserves the recorded order and wording; the linked JSON keeps the complete machine-readable structure.

## Record overview

- **Events:** 5
- **Recorded user turns:** 0
- **Tool calls:** 2

## How to read this transcript

`User` marks a recorded user-role instruction, `Assistant` marks an agent response, and the collapsible `Tool call` / `Tool result` blocks show the actions and observations between them. A user-role record may come from another agent or the runtime system; it is not an authorship label.

5	\label{sec:discuss_kstar}
6	
7	The Data Processing Inequality guarantees the existence of a finite $\Ktheory$ beyond which adjacent generations become indistinguishable (Section~\ref{sec:formulation}).
8	Our empirical result---$\Kempirical = 2$ consistently across all 8 tested configurations (4 model-mode combinations and 4 decoding strategies; Section~\ref{sec:kstar_boundary}, Figure~\ref{fig:auc_decay})---establishes that this boundary is not only finite but remarkably shallow at the $\leq$1.5B parameter scale.
9	
10	The shallowness of $\Kempirical$ is explained by the rate of information loss across generations.
11	The 0v1 boundary is near-trivially separable ($\auc > 0.99$ across all configurations; Table~\ref{tab:kstar_ci}), reflecting the large distributional gap between human text and first-generation synthetic text.
12	At the 1v2 boundary, $\auc$ drops by approximately 30 percentage points ($\auc$ range: 0.6112--0.7039 across all eight model$\times$decoding conditions; Table~\ref{tab:kstar_ci}, Figure~\ref{fig:auc_decay}; see also Figure~\ref{fig:s1_auc_decay_ci} in the Appendix), indicating that the majority of the discriminative signal is consumed in the first generation step.
13	By the 2v3 boundary, $\auc$ falls to 0.5496--0.5917 across all eight model$\times$decoding conditions (upper bound from nucleus $p{=}0.9$ decoding; Figure~\ref{fig:auc_decay})---below the operational threshold $\theta = 0.60$---and deeper pairs converge toward chance.
14	Recursive generation thus acts as a severely lossy channel whose information bottleneck is traversed within two steps.
15	
16	The feature degradation analysis (Section~\ref{sec:feature_degradation}) provides mechanistic evidence for this rapid collapse.
17	The most discriminative features---surprisal variance (\texttt{surp\_d1\_std}, \texttt{surp\_std}) and its derivatives---all capture the heterogenei

### Assistant

_source line 5 · 2026-05-14T07:58:26.324593+00:00_

已在 `\subsection{Feature Importance Across Decoding Strategies}` 之后、`\subsection{LLM Zero-Shot Baseline}` 之前插入 `\subsection{Scale Considerations}`（约 20 行）。覆盖了全部 5 个要点：methodological lower bound 定位、framework 的 scale-agnostic 性质、两种 scaling 结果的论证、scaling laws 文献引用（dohmatob2024model, kaplan2020scaling, shumailov2024collapse, alemohammad2024selfconsuming）、以及 7B validation 作为 immediate next step 的 future work 标注。

需要确认 `kaplan2020scaling` 已在 bib 文件中定义，否则需要添加。
