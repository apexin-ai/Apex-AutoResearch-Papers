# Paper Framing — symb_invariant_consensus

## Target Venue
- Primary: EMNLP 2026 Main (ARR May 25)
- Fallback: AAAI 2027 (Aug 1)
- Deadline: May 25, 2026 (ARR submission)

## Core Claims (3 条)
1. **Principled Tiebreaking**: SICA resolves Self-Consistency voting ties through symbolic constraint weighting, achieving higher accuracy than arbitrary tiebreak rules on logic reasoning benchmarks (FOLIO +6.7pp, combined +3.3pp on 60 questions; target: statistically significant on 200+ questions).
2. **Operating Regime Characterization**: The effectiveness of symbolic consensus is conditional on trace diversity — SICA adds value when model outputs are diverse (instruction models, C0>20%) but provably degenerates to SC when models are self-consistent (reasoning models, C0<5%). This is a model property, not a task property.
3. **C0 as Practical Diagnostic**: Multi-candidate rate (C0) serves as a zero-cost predictor of whether SICA deployment will yield gains over SC, enabling practitioners to decide without running full symbolic analysis.

## Core Insight
Symbolic constraint consensus doesn't uniformly improve reasoning — it specifically helps when there IS disagreement to resolve. We provide the first systematic study of WHEN symbolic consensus adds value, revealing that model architecture (reasoning vs instruction) determines the operating regime. This transforms SICA from "yet another ensemble method" into "a method with formally characterizable applicability boundaries."

## Story Spine
- **Problem**: Self-Consistency (SC) aggregates LLM reasoning paths via majority voting but treats all chains as opaque votes, discarding the logical structure within them. When votes are tied, SC falls back to arbitrary rules (alphabetical, random) with no principled resolution.
- **Existing approaches & gaps**: SC (Wang et al. 2023) — pure voting, no reasoning structure. USC (Chen et al. 2023) — universal SC, still voting-based. None exploit the formal logical structure within reasoning traces for consensus, and none characterize when symbolic methods help vs. don't.
- **Our framing**: SICA extracts first-order logic constraints from reasoning traces and uses weighted partial MAX-SAT to find the globally consistent answer. We show this provides principled tiebreaking (75% win rate on ties vs 25% for SC) but only when trace diversity exists. We formalize this as C0 (multi-candidate rate) and show it's governed by model type, not task type.
- **Headline result template**: "On FOLIO, SICA achieves 80.0% vs SC's 73.3% (+6.7pp) with Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct. On the same benchmarks with QwQ-32B, SICA degenerates to SC (C0=3.6%), revealing that symbolic consensus effectiveness is governed by trace diversity, not task difficulty."

## Anticipated Reviewer Concerns & Defensive Experiments
1. **"Gains not statistically significant"** → exp-001: Expand to 200+ questions for statistical power
2. **"Only a better tiebreaker, not worth the overhead"** → exp-002: K sensitivity showing benefit pattern; exp-009: overhead analysis
3. **"Only one non-reasoning model"** → exp-004: Add Qwen2.5-7B for scaling; exp-007: 72B-AWQ for camera-ready
4. **"ProofWriter shows 0pp gain"** → Domain analysis in exp-001 expanded results
5. **"Random tiebreak baseline closes the gap"** → exp-003: Direct SICA vs SC-random vs SC-deterministic comparison
6. **"Why not just use a reasoning model?"** → exp-005: QwQ-32B data shows reasoning models are self-consistent (don't need consensus improvement), but instruction models (cheaper, more deployed) benefit from SICA

## Venue Fit Risks
- EMNLP: Contribution may feel narrow if framed as ONLY tiebreaking. Primary intellectual contribution is the "operating regime characterization" — the tiebreaking mechanism is evidence, not the claim.
- Cross-discipline: Combines formal logic (MAX-SAT) with NLP (LLM reasoning). MAX-SAT needs clear explanation for NLP audience.
- Negative results: QwQ-32B data must be presented as insight ("When Does Symbolic Consensus Degenerate?"), not failure.
- Statistical power: 60-question results are fragile. 200+ question expansion is prerequisite for credible submission.
