1	\section{Discussion}
2	\label{sec:discussion}
3	
4	The oracle experiment (Table~\ref{tab:main_results}, bottom) is not merely an upper bound on SICA performance; it constitutes a causal intervention that isolates the source of failure. By replacing only the constraint source (from self-extracted to gold FOL annotations) while holding all other pipeline components fixed, we establish that the MAX-SAT aggregation mechanism is effective when supplied with discriminative constraints. The +8.82pp improvement ($p < 0.001$) confirms that aggregation is not the bottleneck. This oracle design follows established methodology in compositional reasoning research: \citet{press2023compositionality} use oracle sub-question decompositions to isolate compositionality gaps, \citet{trivedi2023ircot} employ oracle retrieval to separate retrieval from reasoning errors, and \citet{saparov2023greedy} supply gold FOL proofs to test reasoning capacity independent of formalization skill. Our oracle applies the same logic to constraint extraction, pinpointing same-model self-extraction as the single point of failure.
5	
6	Several recent systems report positive results on overlapping benchmarks using symbolic constraints. DyLoS \citep{xu2026dylos} achieves gains through multi-paradigm solver selection that routes problems to appropriate formal systems. Aristotle \citep{li2025aristotle} applies logic-complete decomposition that breaks complex premises into independently verifiable units. FoVer \citep{wang2025fover} trains a dedicated FOL verifier on supervised data, so the reasoning model need not extract its own constraints. LogicAgent \citep{luo2025logicagent} employs multi-perspective grounding to construct constraints from diverse viewpoints. The common thread is that none of these methods rely on same-model self-extraction. Their success is complementary to our negative finding, not contradictory. The oracle result confirms that the gap these methods bridge (up to +8.82pp) is real and recoverable through external means.
7	
8	The +8.82pp oracle ceiling quantifies the potential that remains locked behind the capability trap. Three concrete paths can unlock this potential. First, trained FOL extractors, supervised on datasets with gold annotations such as FOLIO, can learn extraction patterns that exceed same-model capabilities. Second, external provers that verify constraints independently of the reasoning model eliminate the circular dependency between generation and verification. Third, cross-model extraction, where a separate model extracts constraints from another model's reasoning traces, breaks the self-reference loop that produces non-discriminative constraints. Each approach targets the extraction bottleneck identified by our ablation: since MAX-SAT and count-only produce identical predictions on 803 of 804 instances (Table~\ref{tab:ablation}), improving the aggregation mechanism offers no path forward.
9	
10	Our analysis also reveals $C_0$ (the multi-candidate rate) as a zero-cost diagnostic for practitioners considering constraint-based voting. $C_0$ is computable directly from the trace sampling stage, before any constraint extraction occurs. When $C_0$ falls below 5\%, as with QwQ-32B ($C_0 = 2.6\%$), SICA degenerates to SC by construction because nearly all questions receive unanimous answers. High $C_0$ is necessary but not sufficient for SICA to outperform SC, since the capability trap can render extracted constraints non-discriminative even when candidate disagreement is abundant (e.g., LLaMA-3.1-8B on FOLIO, $C_0 = 61.8\%$, $\Delta = 0$). Practitioners should compute $C_0$ from the sampling stage before investing in constraint extraction: low $C_0$ rules out any possible gain, while high $C_0$ warrants further investigation of constraint quality before deployment.

1	\section{Experiments}
2	\label{sec:experiments}
3	
4	\subsection{Experimental Setup}
5	\label{sec:exp-setup}
6	
7	We evaluate SICA against Self-Consistency (SC) across five instruction-tuned models and four reasoning benchmarks.
8	
9	\paragraph{Models.} We test Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct~\cite{yang2024qwen25}, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3~\cite{jiang2023mistral}, LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct~\cite{dubey2024llama3}, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B~\cite{guo2025deepseekr1}, and QwQ-32B~\cite{qwen2024qwq}. This selection spans 7B to 32B parameters and includes one reasoning-specialized model (QwQ-32B) and one distilled reasoning model (DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B) that, as our results show, behaves as an instruction-scale model rather than a reasoning model.
10	
11	\paragraph{Datasets.} FOLIO~\cite{han2022folio} provides formal logic problems with gold first-order logic (FOL) annotations ($n=204$), which enable the oracle control experiment (\S\ref{sec:oracle}). ProofWriter~\cite{tafjord2021proofwriter} tests multi-step deductive reasoning ($n=600$). StrategyQA~\cite{geva2021strategyqa} evaluates commonsense reasoning ($n=200$ for LLaMA-3.1-8B; $n=60$ for other models). ARC-Challenge~\cite{clark2018arc} covers science questions ($n=60$).
12	
13	\paragraph{Parameters.} Unless otherwise noted, we sample $K=12$ reasoning traces per question at temperature $T=0.7$. Z3~\cite{demoura2008z3} solves each MAX-SAT instance with a 10-second timeout. Temperature ablation experiments vary $T \in \{0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 1.0\}$.
14	
15	\paragraph{Metrics.} We report accuracy (\%), the multi-candidate rate $C_0$ (\S\ref{sec:c0}), and the accuracy gap $\Delta = \text{SICA} - \text{SC}$ in percentage points (pp). Statistical significance is assessed with the McNemar test for paired binary outcomes at $\alpha = 0.05$. For adequately powered conditions ($n \geq 200$), we also compute 95\% bootstrap confidence intervals with 1{,}000 resamples.
16	
17	
18	\subsection{Main Results: SICA Provides No Significant Gain}
19	\label{sec:main-results}
20	
21	Does symbolic constraint aggregation improve answer accuracy over majority voting? Table~\ref{tab:main_results} reports results across all model-domain conditions. The answer is no.
22	
23	\begin{table*}[t]
24	\centering
25	\small
26	\caption{Accuracy of Self-Consistency (SC) and SICA across five models and four domains. $\Delta$ denotes the SICA$-$SC gap in percentage points. No self-extraction condition reaches statistical significance ($\alpha = 0.05$). The oracle upper bound replaces self-extracted constraints with gold FOL annotations verified by Z3. $\dagger$: $n \leq 60$, insufficient power for confirmatory conclusions. $\ddagger$: $n=30$ pilot, included for operating regime characterization. $^a$McNemar test for $n \geq 200$; exact binomial test on discordant pairs for $n \leq 60$.}

47	\end{table*}
48	
49	Across the four adequately powered conditions ($n \geq 200$, combined $N = 1{,}208$), the SICA--SC gap ranges from $-2.45$ to $+2.00$~pp. None reaches significance: the two nonzero gaps yield $p = 0.267$ and $p = 0.424$, and the remaining two conditions produce identical predictions. The largest positive gap ($+2.00$~pp, LLaMA-3.1-8B on StrategyQA) falls within chance variation ($p = 0.424$). The largest negative gap ($-2.45$~pp, LLaMA-3.1-8B on FOLIO) is similarly nonsignificant ($p = 0.267$), but its direction shows that SICA can harm accuracy when self-extracted constraints introduce noise.
50	
51	The five smaller conditions ($n \leq 60$, marked $\dagger$) are consistent with this null pattern. Qwen2.5-14B on StrategyQA shows $\Delta = +3.33$~pp ($p = 0.50$, exact binomial on 2 discordant pairs). DeepSeek-R1-7B on FOLIO+ProofWriter shows $\Delta = -3.33$~pp ($p = 0.480$). QwQ-32B on AIME produces identical outputs ($\Delta = 0$) with effective $C_0 = 2.6\%$, confirming that reasoning-specialized models leave no room for SICA to operate.
52	
53	Across nine self-extraction conditions, five models, and more than 1,300 evaluation instances, SICA does not improve upon majority voting. However, the oracle row at the bottom of Table~\ref{tab:main_results} tells a different story: with gold FOL constraints verified by Z3, SICA achieves $+8.82$~pp over SC ($p < 0.001$), proving that the aggregation mechanism is effective when given high-quality constraints. The next three subsections investigate why self-extraction fails to provide such constraints.
54

56	\subsection{Oracle Control: The Aggregation Mechanism Is Effective}
57	\label{sec:oracle}
58	
59	Is the null result caused by a flawed aggregation mechanism, or by low-quality extracted constraints? To separate these explanations, we construct an oracle variant of SICA that replaces self-extracted FOL constraints with gold FOL annotations from the FOLIO dataset ($n = 204$). The oracle uses Z3 to evaluate ground-truth formulas against each candidate answer; all other pipeline components remain identical.
60	
61	Oracle-SICA achieves 88.24\% accuracy, compared to 79.41\% for both SC and standard SICA (Table~\ref{tab:main_results}). The improvement of $+8.82$~pp is highly significant (McNemar $p = 6.15 \times 10^{-5}$). Z3 satisfiability checks on gold FOL annotations agree with ground-truth labels for 193 of 204 problems (94.6\% agreement), so the solver operates correctly on well-formed constraints. This result establishes two conclusions. First, the weighted partial MAX-SAT aggregation mechanism is sound: given correct constraints, it recovers answers that majority voting misses. Second, the bottleneck lies entirely in constraint extraction quality. When the LLM extracts its own FOL constraints from reasoning traces, the resulting formulas do not carry enough discriminative signal to outperform vote counting. The oracle control is the strongest evidence that the capability trap is a constraint quality problem, not an aggregation design problem.

64	\subsection{Capability Trap Diagnostics}
65	\label{sec:diagnostics}
66	
67	Why does SICA fail to improve over SC? We examine three diagnostic dimensions: the multi-candidate rate $C_0$, constraint extraction quality, and the effect of sampling temperature on answer diversity.
68	
69	\paragraph{Multi-candidate rate.} Table~\ref{tab:capability_trap} reports $C_0$, extraction rate, and contradiction rate for each condition. Two distinct failure regimes emerge. For QwQ-32B, a reasoning-specialized model, $C_0$ is only 2.6\% across tested conditions. Qwen2.5-14B on GSM8K exhibits a different failure mode: the extraction rate drops to 14.7\% (constraints are absent entirely rather than non-discriminative), and $C_0 = 13.3\%$ leaves little room for aggregation. With over 97\% of questions answered unanimously across $K=12$ traces, SICA reduces to SC by construction and cannot provide any benefit regardless of constraint quality. For instruction-tuned models (Qwen2.5-14B, Mistral-7B, LLaMA-3.1-8B, DeepSeek-R1-7B), $C_0$ ranges from 5.0\% (ARC-Challenge) to 61.8\% (FOLIO with LLaMA-3.1-8B). Higher $C_0$ creates more questions where SICA could in principle differ from SC, yet $\Delta$ remains nonsignificant across all conditions. High $C_0$ is necessary but not sufficient: disagreement among traces exists, but the extracted constraints cannot resolve it correctly. Figure~\ref{fig:operating_regime} maps $C_0$ against the SICA--SC gap for all conditions, and the gap stays centered around zero regardless of $C_0$.

93	
94	\paragraph{Extraction quality.} Extraction rates are generally high (0.70 to 1.00), and contradiction rates remain below 7\% across all measured conditions. These metrics indicate that the extraction pipeline is mechanically functional: the LLM produces well-formed, internally consistent constraints at high rates. The problem is not extraction failure but extraction vacuity. The constraints are syntactically valid but semantically redundant with the answer they were derived from, as analyzed in \S\ref{sec:maxsat} and confirmed by the ablation in \S\ref{sec:ablation}. Even with LLaMA-3.1-8B on FOLIO, where $C_0 = 61.8\%$ and extraction rate reaches 0.94, $\Delta$ is $-2.45$~pp. The highest extraction quality among all conditions corresponds to SICA performing \emph{worse} than SC.
95	
96	\paragraph{Temperature ablation.} If SICA's failure stems from insufficient answer diversity at $T = 0.7$, increasing temperature should raise $C_0$ and create more opportunities for constraint-based discrimination. We test $T \in \{0.3, 0.5, 1.0\}$ with Qwen2.5-14B on a 60-question subset from a single ablation run. $C_0$ increases monotonically from 30.0\% ($T=0.3$) to 38.3\% ($T=0.5$) to 43.3\% ($T=1.0$), yet $\Delta$ is exactly 0.0~pp at all three temperatures with zero discordant pairs. Higher diversity does not translate into better constraint discrimination. Figure~\ref{fig:capability_scatter} plots the per-problem relationship between vote entropy and constraint exclusion rate for a representative condition.

109	\label{fig:operating_regime}
110	\end{figure}
111	
112	The diagnostic picture is consistent across all three dimensions: SICA fails not because of insufficient diversity or mechanical extraction errors, but because the extracted constraints carry no discriminative signal beyond the votes they were derived from.
113	
114	
115	\subsection{Constraint Ablation: MAX-SAT Degenerates to Counting}
116	\label{sec:ablation}
117	
118	The diagnostics above suggest that self-extracted constraints are semantically coupled to their source answers and therefore non-discriminative. If so, the MAX-SAT formulation should produce the same predictions as simpler baselines that ignore constraint satisfiability. We test this prediction with three ablation variants on Qwen2.5-14B across combined FOLIO and ProofWriter data ($n = 804$):
119	
120	\begin{itemize}
121	\item \textbf{SICA (MAX-SAT):} The full pipeline as described in \S\ref{sec:method}.
122	\item \textbf{Count-only:} Select the answer supported by the most constraints, ignoring satisfiability.
123	\item \textbf{Random-weight:} Randomize constraint weights before MAX-SAT solving.
124	\end{itemize}
125	
126	\begin{table}[t]
127	\centering
128	\small
129	\caption{Constraint ablation (Qwen2.5-14B, $n = 804$, FOLIO + ProofWriter). SC serves as the majority-vote baseline. Agreement columns report the number of identical predictions out of 804 against SC and against the count-only baseline.}
130	\label{tab:ablation}
131	\begin{tabular}{@{}lrcc@{}}
132	\toprule
133	Aggregation & Acc.\ (\%) & w/ SC & w/ Count-only \\
134	\midrule
135	SC (majority vote) & 76.24 & --- & 774\,/\,804 \\
136	SICA (MAX-SAT) & 76.49 & 773\,/\,804 & 803\,/\,804 \\
137	Count-only & 76.62 & 774\,/\,804 & --- \\
138	Random-weight & 75.87 & 764\,/\,804 & 786\,/\,804 \\
139	\bottomrule
140	\end{tabular}
141	\end{table}
142	
143	Table~\ref{tab:ablation} reports the results. MAX-SAT and count-only agree on 803 of 804 predictions, confirming the degeneration predicted in Equation~\ref{eq:degenerate}: the satisfiability structure adds nothing beyond simple counting. Against SC, all three variants change 30 to 40 predictions, but wins and losses approximately cancel (MAX-SAT: 16 wins, 14 losses among 31 discordant pairs), yielding near-zero net accuracy differences. Self-extracted constraints are tightly coupled to their source answers and carry no independent discriminative signal.
144	
145	This ablation directly supports the capability trap thesis. Symbolic verification \emph{can} improve answer selection, as the oracle control demonstrates with $+8.82$~pp over SC. But the improvement requires constraints that encode independent problem structure. Self-extracted constraints instead encode the reasoning steps that produced each candidate answer, and so they are redundant with the votes they accompany.

This selection spans 7B to 32B parameters and includes one reasoning-specialized model (QwQ-32B) and one distilled reasoning model (DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B) that, as our results show, behaves as an instruction-scale model rather than a reasoning model.\n\n\\paragraph{Datasets.} FOLIO~\\cite{han2022folio} provides formal logic problems with gold first-order logic (FOL) annotations ($n=204$), which enable the oracle control experiment (\\S\\ref{sec:oracle}).

We test this prediction with three ablation variants on Qwen2.5-14B across combined FOLIO and ProofWriter data ($n = 804$):\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item \\textbf{SICA (MAX-SAT):} The full pipeline as described in \\S\\ref{sec:method}.\n\\item \\textbf{Count-only:} Select the answer supported by the most constraints, ignoring satisfiability.\n\\item \\textbf{Random-weight:} Randomize constraint weights before MAX-SAT solving.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\begin{table}[t]\n\\centering\n\\small\n\\caption{Constraint ablation (Qwen2.5-14B, $n = 804$, FOLIO + ProofWriter). SC serves as the majority-vote baseline. Agreement columns report the number of identical predictions out of 804 against SC and against the count-only baseline.}\n\\label{tab:ablation}\n\\begin{tabular}{@{}lrcc@{}}\n\\toprule\nAggregation & Acc.\\ (\\%) & w/ SC & w/ Count-only \\\\\n\\midrule\nSC (majority vote) & 76.24 & --- & 774\\,/\\,804 \\\\\nSICA (MAX-SAT) & 76.49 & 773\\,/\\,804 & 803\\,/\\,804 \\\\\nCount-only & 76.62 & 774\\,/\\,804 & --- \\\\\nRandom-weight & 75.87 & 764\\,/\\,804 & 786\\,/\\,804 \\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\n\nTable~\\ref{tab:ablation} reports the results. MAX-SAT and count-only agree on 803 of 804 predictions, confirming the degeneration predicted in Equation~\\ref{eq:degenerate}: the satisfiability structure adds nothing beyond simple counting. Against SC, all three variants change 30 to 40 predictions, but wins and losses approximately cancel (MAX-SAT: 16 wins, 14 losses among 31 discordant pairs), yielding near-zero net accuracy differences. Self-extracted constraints are tightly coupled to their source answers and carry no independent discriminative signal.\n\nThis ablation directly supports the capability trap thesis. Symbolic verification \\emph{can} improve answer selection, as the oracle control demonstrates with $+8.82$~pp over SC. But the improvement requires constraints that encode independent problem structure. Self-extracted constraints instead encode the reasoning steps that produced each candidate answer, and so they are redundant with the votes they accompany.\n",

The introduction is also a placeholder, but I have the structure notes. Let me now write the conclusion based on the discussion, experiments, and the task instructions. Key points to include:

1. Summary of main finding: capability trap, self-extracted constraints cannot beat majority voting
2. Implications: C0 diagnostic, trained extractors vs self-extraction
3. Brief future directions

Let me draft this carefully following all the style rules (no dashes, no -ing endings, no AI patterns, concise).

  "content": "\\section{Conclusion}\n\\label{sec:conclusion}\n\nThis work presents a systematic evaluation of symbolic constraint aggregation for LLM majority voting across five models, four reasoning domains, and more than 1,300 instances. The central finding is negative: when an LLM extracts first-order logic constraints from its own reasoning traces and a MAX-SAT solver aggregates them, accuracy does not improve over standard majority voting. The gap ranges from $-3.3$ to $+2.0$ percentage points, with no condition reaching statistical significance. We trace this failure to a capability trap: self-extracted constraints are semantically coupled to the answers they accompany and carry no independent discriminative signal. The MAX-SAT solver agrees with simple constraint counting on 803 of 804 instances, which confirms that satisfiability structure adds nothing when constraints are redundant with votes.\n\nAn oracle control experiment isolates constraint quality as the sole bottleneck. Replacing self-extracted constraints with gold FOL annotations yields $+8.82$ percentage points over majority voting ($p < 0.001$), while all other pipeline components remain fixed. The aggregation mechanism is sound; the problem lies entirely in same-model self-extraction. This result quantifies an $8.82$-point gap that remains recoverable through higher-quality constraint sources.\n\nFor practitioners, we identify the multi-candidate rate $C_0$ as a zero-cost diagnostic: when $C_0$ falls below 5\\%, constraint-based methods cannot improve over majority voting regardless of constraint quality, and investment in extraction is unwarranted. For the field, our results suggest that productive directions include trained FOL extractors, external theorem provers, and cross-model constraint extraction, all of which break the circular dependency between generation and verification that defines the capability trap.\n"

The central finding is negative: when an LLM extracts first-order logic constraints from its own reasoning traces and a MAX-SAT solver aggregates them, accuracy does not improve over standard majority voting. The gap ranges from $-3.3$ to $+2.0$ percentage points, with no condition reaching statistical significance. We trace this failure to a capability trap: self-extracted constraints are semantically coupled to the answers they accompany and carry no independent discriminative signal. The MAX-SAT solver agrees with simple constraint counting on 803 of 804 instances, which confirms that satisfiability structure adds nothing when constraints are redundant with votes.\n\nAn oracle control experiment isolates constraint quality as the sole bottleneck. Replacing self-extracted constraints with gold FOL annotations yields $+8.82$ percentage points over majority voting ($p < 0.001$), while all other pipeline components remain fixed. The aggregation mechanism is sound; the problem lies entirely in same-model self-extraction. This result quantifies an $8.82$-point gap that remains recoverable through higher-quality constraint sources.\n\nFor practitioners, we identify the multi-candidate rate $C_0$ as a zero-cost diagnostic: when $C_0$ falls below 5\\%, constraint-based methods cannot improve over majority voting regardless of constraint quality, and investment in extraction is unwarranted. For the field, our results suggest that productive directions include trained FOL extractors, external theorem provers, and cross-model constraint extraction, all of which break the circular dependency between generation and verification that defines the capability trap.\n",
