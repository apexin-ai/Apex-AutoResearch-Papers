Prepared 2026-05-20. Three predicted attack points with pre-drafted responses.

## Response #1: Single-Environment Generalization (Attack probability: 90%)

We thank the reviewer for this important observation. We distinguish between our **methodological contribution** (the diagnostic framework) and our **empirical finding** (death dominance in ScienceWorld). The quantitative results (DAF=90.4%, 78.9% label fraction) are specific to ScienceWorld, as stated in Limitations ¶1; the framework's generality claim is methodological.

Three lines of evidence support framework applicability beyond ScienceWorld: (1) **ALFWorld** (§3.4): the framework successfully diagnoses a qualitatively different mechanism—information asymmetry from admissible-action access (94.6% det-preferred, 0% death)—without any modification, demonstrating that the diagnostic procedure generalizes even when the dominant signal differs. Cross-model ALFWorld replication (Llama-3.1-8B, 135 games) confirms 100% directional consistency (16/16 non-tie labels favor deterministic, 95% CI for det-preferred: [6.7%, 17.8%]). Combined with Qwen2.5-7B's 25.9% det-preferred (94.6% directional consistency, 35/37 non-tie labels), both models diagnose information asymmetry—not death—as the routing mechanism in ALFWorld, without framework modification. Gemma-2-9B-it (220 episodes, DAF=89.7%, 95% CI [79.5%, 98.4%]) confirms death dominance across a third model family employing sliding window attention, with 10/10 death-prone task types showing positive ΔDR. (2) **MATH** (§3.4): the framework correctly identifies the absence of routing signal (p=0.81), a useful null result. (3) **MiniHack/Crafter** (§5): the framework correctly diagnoses two boundary conditions (no death mechanism; universal death without asymmetry). These are not failures—they are the framework performing its diagnostic function on environments where routing signal is absent or unexploitable.

Within ScienceWorld, extended validation on 5 excluded task types (n=100; Appendix S) yields DAF=0.991, confirming that task exclusion does not bias toward death-prone tasks.

**Sensitivity analysis strengthens cross-model consistency**: Excluding the single zero-death task type (find-non-living-thing), DAF rises to ≥97% across all three model families (Qwen: 100.0% [100.0, 100.0], Llama: 97.0% [91.3, 100.0], Gemma: 99.9% [99.7, 100.0]; Appendix). The wider CI in Gemma's full analysis ([79.5%, 98.4%]) is a mechanical effect of including a zero-death outlier task, not method instability.

## Response #2: Non-triviality / Novelty (Attack probability: 70%)

We thank the reviewer for this important observation. While the *direction* of death dominance may appear predictable given ScienceWorld's −100 penalty, three empirically verified predictions were not obvious a priori:

**(1) Intervention resistance across scales.** Qwen2.5-72B (10× parameters, independently collected at 72B for both strategies) reduces death rate to 30.6% but DAF *increases* to 92.4% (vs 7B's 90.4%). Scaling makes agents safer but does not reduce death dominance—a non-trivial outcome since one might expect larger models to diversify the signal beyond death avoidance.

**(2) Self-correction overcompensation.** Reflexion (N=3) yields DAF>100%: after self-correction, the internal strategy *outperforms* deterministic on non-death episodes (Δ_nd=−0.47), meaning death avoidance more than fully accounts for the entire performance gap. The routing signal is not merely death-dominated—it is *exclusively* death-driven after self-correction.

**(3) Inverted-U vulnerability.** A 0.5B model shows *reduced* death rate (13.3%) because it is too weak to reach dangerous states, suggesting capability and vulnerability are non-monotonically related.

**(4) Cross-architecture consistency.** Three architecturally distinct models (Qwen/GQA, Llama/GQA, Gemma/SWA) independently converge on DAF 88–90% (point estimates within 2.2pp, all CIs overlapping). This is a non-trivial outcome—different architectures could plausibly exhibit different vulnerability patterns, yet death dominance is remarkably stable.

**(5) Near-total death explanation when zero-death tasks excluded.** Sensitivity analysis excluding the single zero-death task type shows DAF ≥97% across all three families (Qwen: 100.0%, Llama: 97.0%, Gemma: 99.9%). For tasks *with* death mechanisms, death avoidance explains virtually all routing signal—the residual non-death gap is ≤3%. This near-ceiling consistency across architectures was not predictable from ScienceWorld's penalty structure alone.

These findings collectively show that death dominance is *resistant to reasonable interventions, consistent across architectures, and near-total for death-prone tasks*—a conclusion that requires the precise quantification our framework provides.

## Response #3: Actionability / Practical Impact (Attack probability: 60%)

We thank the reviewer for this important observation. The practical contribution operates at the **meta-level**: before committing to router development in any new environment, practitioners can run our three-stage diagnostic pilot (Appendix R) using ~50 episodes (~2 GPU-hours) to answer: *Does routing signal exist? What drives it? Is a learned router worth building?*

This meta-question has concrete value. Our router training consumed ~200 GPU-hours without exceeding the always-deterministic baseline—an outcome the 50-episode pilot correctly predicted for all four tested conditions (always-deterministic, always-internal, random, trained router). The framework's diagnostic power lies not in building better routers, but in **determining whether router development is warranted** before investing in it.

The framework also provides deployment guidance: when DAF≈1 (as in ScienceWorld), always-deterministic is provably near-optimal (96.3% of oracle decisions match it), eliminating the need for runtime routing overhead entirely. When DAF≈0 (as in MATH), neither strategy dominates and routing has no value. The diagnostic thus converts an open-ended engineering question ("should we build a router?") into a quantitative decision with clear thresholds.

We acknowledge that the death-dominance finding is specific to ScienceWorld, though consistent across three model families within it; applying the full diagnostic pipeline to additional interactive environments with catastrophic failure mechanisms remains important future work.
