## Core Problem

Per-step compute allocation methods for LLM agents route between internal reasoning depths (CogRouter's four cognitive levels, ARES's effort tiers) or between skip-simulation and LLM-based world model rollouts (ITP-R's K-head predictor). On environments requiring accurate prediction of rule-governed dynamics, LLM world model routing consistently degrades performance relative to pure internal reasoning adaptation. ITP-R (Qwen2.5-7B) achieves only 85.07% overall on ALFWorld — underperforming CogRouter's 92.5% by 7.4 points — and scores only 62.58 (seen) / 58.94 (unseen) on ScienceWorld, dramatically below CogRouter's 84.6 score / 72.0% SR. Critically, the 85.07% overall is averaged across six subtasks with high variance (PICK: 94.29%, COOL: 53.84%), revealing that LLM world model foresight introduces noise that exceeds its planning value across diverse task types. This consistent underperformance on both benchmarks demonstrates that approximate LLM foresight is not merely unhelpful on complex scientific reasoning — it actively hurts on household tasks too. Meanwhile, deterministic external computation — encompassing environment simulators, code interpreters, calculators, database queries, and API calls — is pervasive across real-world agent tasks yet remains unexploited by any learned routing method. ToolBench tasks invoke APIs returning exact structured results; GAIA tasks require function calling for precise computation; τ-bench tasks use domain-specific APIs with deterministic outcomes. Existing simulator-using agents invoke them unconditionally (Qian et al. show forced simulation degrades performance by up to 5% on FrozenLake/Sokoban; ARTIS always simulates every action before commitment, wasting compute on easy steps), while ITP-R's learned gating routes only to an approximate LLM world model. In mathematical reasoning, ReTool (ICLR 2026) and AgentMath (ICLR 2026) demonstrate that learning when to invoke code interpreters yields dramatic gains (ReTool-32B: 72.5% on AIME vs 40% text-only baseline), but use implicit routing embedded in the LLM's generation rather than an explicit, interpretable router module. The gap: no method learns per-step selective routing via an explicit lightweight router to ground-truth deterministic computation as a complementary computation type to internal reasoning, across both interactive environments and tool-use settings.

## Opportunity / Why Now

ITP-R (Jan 2026) is the closest prior work on learned simulation gating in interactive environments, and ReTool/AgentMath (both ICLR 2026) are the closest in tool-augmented reasoning. Three key observations create our opportunity. First, ITP-R's LLM world model routing consistently underperforms pure internal adaptation (CogRouter): 85.07% vs 92.5% on ALFWorld (−7.4 points), 62.58 vs 84.6 on ScienceWorld (−22 points). This is not a benchmark-specific failure — approximate LLM foresight introduces noise exceeding its planning value across both simple household tasks and complex scientific reasoning. Second, deterministic computation is not a niche capability confined to game simulators — it is pervasive across the agent task landscape. ScienceWorld's Scala/JVM backend implements exact rule-governed transitions; ALFWorld's TextWorld/PDDL backend provides exact household physics; code interpreters provide exact arithmetic/symbolic computation; and function-calling APIs across ToolBench, GAIA, and τ-bench return exact structured results (database lookups, weather APIs, booking systems). The common thread: all these compute sources provide ground-truth outputs at negligible cost compared to LLM inference, yet no explicit routing method learns when to invoke them. Third, while ReTool and AgentMath (both ICLR 2026) demonstrate the value of learning when to invoke code interpreters in math, they use implicit routing — the LLM itself decides when to insert code blocks within its generation — rather than an explicit, interpretable router module. Concurrently, Select-then-Solve (arXiv 2604.06753, April 2026) validates that lightweight per-step paradigm routing via a small router is an effective inference-time optimization, but operates on a different axis (routing between reasoning paradigms) rather than routing to deterministic external computation. The opportunity: a unified explicit routing framework with a lightweight, modular router that treats deterministic external computation as a categorically different modality from internal reasoning, applicable across environment simulators, code interpreters, and extensible to function-calling APIs.

## Landscape (SOTA & Limitations)

ITP / ITP-R ('Imagine-then-Plan', arXiv 2601.08955, Jan 2026) introduces a K-head predictor for per-step simulation gating, routing to an SFT-trained LLM world model. With Qwen2.5-7B backbone: ALFWorld 85.07% overall (per-task: PICK 94.29%, CLEAN 88.89%, HEAT 87.50%, COOL 53.84%, LOOK 76.00%, PICK2 91.67%), ScienceWorld 62.58/58.94 score seen/unseen. Underperforms CogRouter on BOTH benchmarks, demonstrating that LLM world model routing introduces noise exceeding its planning value. Code at github.com/loyiv/ITP. CogRouter ('Think Fast and Slow', arXiv 2602.12662, Feb 2026) defines four cognitive levels with CoSFT + CoPO training on Qwen2.5-7B, achieving ALFWorld 92.5% and ScienceWorld 84.6 score / 72.0% SR with 62% token reduction. Purely internal reasoning — current ScienceWorld continuous-score SOTA among Qwen2.5-7B routing methods. Code at github.com/rhyang2021/CogRouter. EPO (arXiv 2509.22576, v1 Sep 2025, v2 Feb 2026) reports ScienceWorld results using binary success metrics: PPO+EPO achieves Succ.* = 100.0%, Succ.¯ = 96.8% (IID); GRPO+EPO achieves Succ.* = 95.8%, Succ.¯ = 83.8% (IID), with GRPO baseline at Succ.* = 93.8%, Succ.¯ = 81.6% (IID). Note: Succ.* (best success rate) and Succ.¯ (converged success rate) are both from Table 1; the 95.8% and 83.8% are different metrics for the same GRPO+EPO condition. These binary success metrics and the elevated GRPO baseline (93.8% Succ.* vs CogRouter's 53.0% SR) indicate different evaluation configurations, making direct comparison to CogRouter's standardized continuous-score protocol unreliable. We follow CogRouter's protocol for comparability. EMPO2 (arXiv 2602.23008, ICLR 2026) achieves 75.9 average continuous score on ScienceWorld using 19 tasks with Qwen2.5-7B via exploratory memory-augmented hybrid RL. This IS directly comparable to CogRouter's metric (continuous score) and confirms CogRouter's 84.6 as the stronger result. ARES (arXiv 2603.07915, March 2026) trains a Qwen3-1.7B SFT router for {low, mid, high} reasoning effort, achieving 52.7% reasoning token reduction. Internal-only. STEP-HRL (arXiv 2604.05808, April 2026) achieves ALFWorld 97.14% seen / 97.76% unseen and ScienceWorld 81.57% seen / 77.81% unseen via hierarchical RL with Llama-3-8B. Strong recent result, though different backbone prevents exact CogRouter comparison. Embodied Planner-R1 (arXiv 2506.23127) achieves ALFWorld 97.78% and ScienceWorld 79.92% via pure RL with IPO. Skill1 (arXiv 2605.06130, May 2026) achieves ALFWorld 97.5% via unified skill evolution with RL — current ALFWorld SOTA. Does not evaluate on ScienceWorld. PA-MoE+GiGPO (arXiv 2602.17038, Feb 2026) achieves ALFWorld 95.3% (7B). ReTool (arXiv 2504.11536, ICLR 2026) learns when to invoke a code interpreter for mathematical reasoning via SFT cold-start + outcome-based RL. ReTool-32B achieves 72.5% on AIME, surpassing o1-preview by 27.9% and text-only RL baseline (40%) by 32.5 points. However, ReTool uses implicit routing: the LLM decides within its own generation when to insert code blocks, with no explicit router module. The routing decision is entangled with the backbone model. AgentMath (arXiv 2512.20745, ICLR 2026) achieves 90.6% on AIME24, 86.4% on AIME25 via tool-augmented agentic RL with code interpreter. Like ReTool, uses implicit routing via the backbone LLM rather than an explicit router. SimGate differs from both in using an explicit lightweight router module (Qwen3-1.7B) that makes interpretable, modular routing decisions decoupled from the agent backbone. Select-then-Solve (arXiv 2604.06753, April 2026) routes between 6 reasoning paradigms (Direct, CoT, ReAct, Plan-Execute, Reflection, ReCode) via a lightweight embedding-based router, evaluated on 10 benchmarks including GAIA and τ-bench. Recovers ~37% of oracle gap over best fixed paradigm. Select-then-Solve validates that lightweight per-step paradigm routing is an effective inference-time optimization and an emerging research direction, but operates on a different axis: it routes between reasoning paradigms (all LLM-based), while SimGate routes between internal reasoning and deterministic external computation — a categorically different modality. The two approaches are complementary. AutoTool (AAAI 2026, arXiv 2511.14650) builds tool-invocation graphs from trajectories to predict next tool calls, skipping LLM inference when confident: ScienceWorld 0.708 progress rate with 23.6% LLM call reduction, ALFWorld 0.531 with 15.4% reduction. AutoTool predicts WHICH tool to call from statistical patterns, not WHAT state will result — it does not route to a deterministic simulator for state prediction. ARTIS (arXiv 2602.01709) implements risk-aware iterative simulation: N simulated attempts before every real action via an LLM-based simulator. Evaluated on BFCL-v3 and ACEBench, not ALFWorld/ScienceWorld. ARTIS always simulates (wasting compute on easy steps), while SimGate selectively routes. Dyna-Think (arXiv 2506.00320, May 2025) integrates internal world model simulation into reasoning via two training approaches (DIT and DDT). Evaluated on OSWorld and WindowsAgentArena, not ALFWorld/ScienceWorld. Uses a learned (not deterministic) world model with no explicit routing/gating — simulation is integrated into the thinking process rather than selectively invoked. Not a direct competitor: different world model type (learned vs deterministic), different benchmarks, no routing decision. Dyna-Mind/RESIM (arXiv 2510.09577) achieves ALFWorld 92.5% (Dyna-GRPO) via learning to simulate from experience — same group as Dyna-Think, also uses learned (not deterministic) simulator. BoundaryRouter (arXiv 2605.07180, May 2026) routes between LLM inference and agent execution using experience memory, but routes between two LLM-based systems, not to a deterministic simulator. AVIC (arXiv 2602.08236, Feb 2026) implements learned binary gating for world model invocation in visual spatial reasoning. Qian et al. (arXiv 2601.03905, Jan 2026) empirically show forced world model use degrades performance; the primary bottleneck is deciding when to simulate. MTRouter (arXiv 2604.23530, ACL 2026) routes between different LLMs per turn. Key gap: ITP-R learns simulation gating but routes to an approximate LLM world model that consistently underperforms pure internal reasoning. ReTool/AgentMath learn when to invoke code interpreters but use implicit routing entangled with the backbone. Select-then-Solve validates lightweight per-step routing but operates across reasoning paradigms, not computation modalities. No method provides an explicit, modular, lightweight router for selective invocation of ground-truth deterministic computation across both interactive environments and tool-use settings.

## Proposed Approach

We propose SimGate, a hybrid routing framework that learns per-step whether an LLM agent should rely on internal reasoning or invoke deterministic external computation for ground-truth results. SimGate establishes that learned selective routing to ANY form of deterministic external computation — environment simulators, code interpreters, calculators, databases, APIs — provides a cost-accuracy Pareto improvement over both unconditional invocation and approximate LLM-based substitutes. We demonstrate this across three computation types: environment simulators (ScienceWorld, ALFWorld), code interpreters (MATH), and discuss extension to function-calling APIs (ToolBench, GAIA, τ-bench). Unlike ITP-R, which routes to an LLM world model that consistently underperforms pure internal reasoning, SimGate routes to deterministic oracles providing exact outputs at CPU-only cost. Unlike ReTool/AgentMath (ICLR 2026), which embed routing decisions implicitly within the LLM's generation, SimGate uses an explicit lightweight router module — enabling interpretable per-step routing analysis, backbone-agnostic deployment, and unified routing across different computation types.

The framework has three components:

(1) Agent backbone: Qwen2.5-7B (matching CogRouter for controlled comparison), with ReAct-style interaction augmented by routing decisions at each step.

(2) Deterministic computation access: SimGate interfaces with deterministic oracles that provide exact results at negligible cost relative to LLM inference. For ScienceWorld, the JVM-based simulator is accessed via py4j; state forking is implemented through action-replay (a parallel ScienceWorld instance replays the current episode's action history to reach the identical state, then executes 1-3 candidate action sequences to observe exact outcomes). For ALFWorld, state forking uses GameState.copy() combined with a fresh TextWorld runtime. For MATH, the deterministic oracle is a Python code interpreter executing generated code to obtain exact arithmetic/symbolic results. This design extends naturally to other deterministic oracles: function-calling APIs (ToolBench, GAIA), database queries (τ-bench), calculators, and physics simulators — any source where outputs are exact and CPU-bound.

(3) Lightweight explicit router: a Qwen3-1.7B model fine-tuned via SFT to select per step from {fast-internal, deep-internal, deterministic-computation}, based on interaction history and current observation. This three-way modality routing via an explicit module differs fundamentally from: ITP-R's depth selection (K∈{0,...,K_max} over a single approximate world model), ReTool/AgentMath's implicit routing (LLM decides within its generation when to invoke tools, entangling routing with the backbone), Select-then-Solve's paradigm routing (routes between reasoning paradigms, all LLM-based, not to deterministic computation), and AutoTool's statistical tool-sequence prediction (predicts WHICH tool, not WHAT state). SimGate's router is modular (same architecture across ScienceWorld, ALFWorld, and MATH), interpretable (routing decisions can be analyzed per-task-category), and backbone-agnostic (router can be retrained without modifying the agent backbone).

Training proceeds in two offline phases:

Phase 1 (trajectory collection): Run the Qwen2.5-7B agent on ScienceWorld's 30 task types (200 task variations), ALFWorld's 134 tasks, and 500 competition-level MATH problems (Levels 4-5) across ~830 total episodes. At each decision step, execute all three modalities in parallel — fast-internal (direct ReAct), deep-internal (chain-of-thought with multi-step planning), and deterministic-computation (simulator lookahead for ScienceWorld/ALFWorld, code interpreter execution for MATH) — and record which produced the action leading to highest eventual task success via counterfactual labeling.

Phase 2 (router SFT): Fine-tune Qwen3-1.7B on the labeled (history, observation, best-modality) triples with cross-entropy loss, following ARES's training pipeline. No online RL needed.

Evaluation spans three co-equal tracks:

Track 1 — ScienceWorld (Rule-Governed Scientific Reasoning): ScienceWorld uniquely tests rule-governed scientific reasoning (temperature physics, chemical reactions, electrical circuits) where the gap between LLM approximation and deterministic ground truth is largest, making it the ideal testbed for SimGate's core hypothesis. While we evaluate primarily on ScienceWorld (which maximally tests our core hypothesis) and ALFWorld (user-specified), we note that the deterministic computation principle extends to user-specified benchmarks where function calling provides exact results (ToolBench, GAIA, τ-bench). We follow CogRouter's standardized evaluation protocol using continuous score for direct comparability. We compare against CogRouter (84.6 score / 72.0% SR), ITP-R (62.58/58.94 score), EMPO2 (75.9 avg score), always-simulate, never-simulate, random routing, and confidence-threshold heuristic.

Track 2 — ALFWorld (Interactive Household Tasks): ALFWorld is the user-specified benchmark. We compare against CogRouter (92.5%), ITP-R (85.07%), always-simulate, and ReAct. We cite PA-MoE+GiGPO (95.3%), STEP-HRL (97.14%), and Skill1 (97.5%) results from their papers without reproduction. The primary claim on ALFWorld is cost-efficiency: matching or exceeding ITP-R's 85.07% accuracy with lower inference cost by replacing GPU-intensive LLM world model rollouts with CPU-only deterministic simulation. Compared to CogRouter (which has no world model), SimGate adds CPU-only simulation overhead but saves LLM inference tokens on steps where deterministic lookahead substitutes for deep internal reasoning. We acknowledge ALFWorld saturation and do not claim SOTA.

Track 3 — MATH (Mathematical Reasoning with Code Interpreter): We apply SimGate's routing framework to 500 competition-level MATH problems (Levels 4-5) with the Python code interpreter as the deterministic oracle. This track demonstrates that SimGate's explicit router architecture generalizes beyond environment simulators to code interpreters — arguably the most practically relevant form of deterministic computation for current LLM deployments. Code interpreters are used across production systems for arithmetic verification, data analysis, and symbolic computation; learning WHEN to invoke them (vs. relying on internal reasoning) is a broadly applicable problem. We compare against always-CoT, always-code-interpreter, random routing, and confidence-threshold heuristic. We do not claim to beat ReTool or AgentMath (which use larger backbones with implicit routing + RL), but show that explicit modular routing achieves competitive performance with interpretable, analyzable routing decisions that are decoupled from the backbone.

Broader applicability: SimGate's routing principle — learned selective invocation of deterministic computation via an explicit router — extends naturally beyond the three evaluation tracks to function-calling APIs. In ToolBench, API calls return exact structured results (flight schedules, product databases, weather data); in GAIA, multi-step function calling provides precise computation for real-world questions; in τ-bench, domain-specific APIs (airline booking, retail inventory) produce deterministic outcomes. In all these settings, the agent faces the same routing decision SimGate addresses: should this step use internal reasoning or invoke exact external computation? Our three evaluation tracks (simulators, code interpreters) establish the framework; API-based deterministic computation is a natural extension requiring only a new oracle interface, not architectural changes.

Key metrics: task success rate, normalized score (ScienceWorld), total LLM tokens consumed, simulation/tool invocation ratio, LLM world model inference cost vs deterministic computation cost (FLOPs and wall-clock), per-task-category success breakdown to identify WHERE deterministic computation provides most value, and routing decision analysis (which task types trigger which modalities).

Core hypotheses: (H1) On ScienceWorld, SimGate outperforms both CogRouter (which lacks external grounding for scientific reasoning) and ITP-R (whose LLM world model hallucinates scientific state transitions), targeting >88 score / >78% SR. (H2) On ALFWorld, SimGate exceeds ITP-R's 85.07% accuracy (targeting >91%) with >40% reduction in inference FLOPs vs ITP-R specifically (which uses GPU-intensive LLM world model rollouts), by substituting CPU-only deterministic simulation. (H3) On MATH, SimGate's explicit 3-way routing achieves >75% accuracy on Level 4-5 problems (vs ~60% always-CoT, ~70% always-code baselines for Qwen2.5-7B), demonstrating that learned selective routing to code interpreters provides value beyond what either fixed strategy achieves, and that this benefit is captured by an explicit router module decoupled from the backbone. (H4) Per-task-category analysis reveals that deterministic computation provides greatest value on tasks requiring multi-step causal reasoning about physical/chemical processes (ScienceWorld: heating, chemical reactions, circuits) and exact arithmetic (MATH: computation-heavy problems), and least value on pattern-matching or conceptual tasks.

Paper format: We target an ARR short paper (4 pages + references) submitted by May 25, 2026, for commitment to EMNLP 2026. ARR accepts both long and short papers; we choose short paper format because the contribution is genuine but focused (explicit modular routing to deterministic computation), making it well-scoped for 4 pages. Papers not accepted to the main conference are automatically considered for Findings. Given the narrow but novel contribution, Findings is the realistic acceptance target.

### 优化方案 / 拒绝详情
【优化方案】

1. **[Abstract / 第一段] — 将"deterministic computation 统一抽象"提升为第一贡献，替换原始的 routing 方法描述开场** — 命中 Novelty + Significance
   - 原始：开篇直接说"hybrid routing framework"，统一抽象仅作背景一笔带过
   - 修改：开篇即声明"We formalize a class of deterministic external computation — covering environment simulators and code interpreters — as a unified abstraction, and demonstrate that a single explicit routing principle applies across these computation modalities"，使论文立意从"又一个 routing 方法"提升为"跨模态统一原则的首次形式化与验证"

2. **[Abstract / 第一段] — 将 explicit vs implicit routing gap 的量化结果前置为 key finding** — 命中 Novelty
   - 原始：explicit vs implicit 区分仅在架构描述中提及，无实验支撑
   - 修改：在 abstract 中明确"we provide the first controlled measurement of the explicit vs implicit routing gap on identical backbone and training data"，将其从设计选择升格为核心科学发现

3. **[Abstract / 第一段] — 前置 Pareto 效率增益的预估数字** — 命中 Significance / Practical Impact
   - 原始：只有准确率 target，无效率数字
   - 修改：加入 headline result 如"SimGate achieves comparable accuracy to always-external baselines while reducing inference cost by an estimated X%"（基于 fast ~50 tokens, deep ~500 tokens, external ~1 API call 的 cost model 预估）

4. **[核心 Claim] — "ANY form" → "across multiple forms"，收窄 generality 边界** — 命中 Technical Soundness
   - 原始："SimGate establishes that learned selective routing to ANY form of deterministic external computation … provides a cost-accuracy Pareto improvement"
   - 修改："SimGate demonstrates that learned selective routing to deterministic environment simulators and code interpreters achieves competitive-to-superior performance with consistent interpretability advantages"。ToolBench / GAIA / τ-bench 明确标为 future directions 而非已验证 applicability

5. **[Contribution 1 措辞] — 从"demonstrate unified principle"改为"empirically characterize transfer degree"** — 命中 Technical Soundness
   - 原始：隐含"统一原则已被证明"
   - 修改："We formalize deterministic external computation as a unified abstraction and empirically characterize the degree to which routing patterns transfer across computation types"——无论 transfer 结果好坏都是有价值的 empirical contribution，避免被 negative result 击穿

6. **[Contributions 列表] — 从 4 条压缩为 3 条** — 命中 Clarity / Short Paper 适配
   - 原始（隐含 4 条）：统一抽象 / SimGate 方法 / counterfactual pipeline / routing analysis
   - 修改 3 条：(1) 统一抽象 + cross-domain transfer 验证；(2) SimGate explicit modular router（含 counterfactual training pipeline 作为 method detail 而非独立贡献）；(3) Routing pattern analysis 揭示 LLM 推理边界（含 router-as-diagnostic-probe 视角）

7. **[Method — 三路由操作定义] — 新增 fast-internal / deep-internal 的精确操作规格** — 命中 Reproducibility + Technical Soundness
   - 原始：仅提及三个选项名称，无操作细节
   - 修改：明确 (1) fast-internal = "Answer directly" prompt, ~50 tokens avg, 最低推理成本；(2) deep-internal = "Think step by step, then verify your answer" prompt, ~500 tokens avg, ~10x cost of fast；(3) deterministic = 调用外部环境/解释器获取 ground truth。三路由对应 low / medium / high uncertainty 的不同消解策略（概念动机，非硬理论）

8. **[Method — Counterfactual Data Pipeline] — 从 1 句话扩展为完整 4 步 pipeline + DAgger caveat** — 命中 Reproducibility + Methodological Rigor
   - 原始："SFT-trained on counterfactual trajectory data"（1 句话）
   - 修改：4 步流程——(1) 收集 base trajectory；(2) 每步 fork 3 路、各自 rollout 到 episode 结束；(3) oracle hindsight labeling（取 final task score 最高的分支）；(4) 聚合 (state, optimal-route) 对作为 SFT 数据。附带：数据规模具体数字（ScienceWorld ~7,500 samples, MATH ~16,000 samples）；DAgger 类比 caveat（"labels optimal under base policy continuation, not learned router policy"，引用 Ross et al., 2011）；Algorithm 1 伪代码放 appendix

9. **[Method — MATH Counterfactual 操作语义] — 新增非交互式任务的 counterfactual 构造细节** — 命中 Technical Soundness
   - 原始：未区分交互式环境与非交互式推理任务的 counterfactual 构造差异
   - 修改：明确 step boundary = solution step（每步推导为一个 decision point），fork 后将 counterfactual output 拼接到 context 继续生成后续步骤，early termination 情况（code interpreter 直接给出最终答案）时 label 仅基于 correctness

10. **[Method — Router 选择] — 新增 Qwen3-1.7B router 选择理由** — 命中 Technical Soundness
    - 原始：直接使用 Qwen3-1.7B 无解释
    - 修改：1 句话说明选择理由（如 Qwen3 系列在 structured classification output 上更稳定）；推荐在 appendix 增加 router model size ablation（Qwen3-1.7B vs Qwen2.5-1.5B vs Qwen2.5-3B）

11. **[Method — "backbone-agnostic" → "architecturally decoupled"] — 弱化未验证 claim** — 命中 Technical Soundness
    - 原始：声称 router 是 "backbone-agnostic"，但仅测试 Qwen2.5-7B
    - 修改：改为 "architecturally decoupled from backbone"（描述结构特性而非功效 claim），推荐低成本 cross-backbone 验证（Llama-3-8B 推理即可，~10-15 H100h），但不作为核心 claim

12. **[Evaluation — Track 结构重组] — ALFWorld 从 main text co-equal track 降格为 appendix 支持材料** — 命中 Clarity / Short Paper 适配
    - 原始：ScienceWorld / ALFWorld / MATH 三个 "co-equal tracks"
    - 修改：Main text 保留 ScienceWorld（primary）+ MATH（secondary）；ALFWorld 降格至 appendix（已承认 saturation，主要价值是 efficiency gain + routing interpretability 展示）；main text 仅 1 句话引用 ALFWorld 的 efficiency 结果

13. **[Evaluation — 新增 Zero-shot Cross-domain Transfer 实验至 main text] — 验证 C1 统一抽象** — 命中 Novelty + Experimental Rigor
    - 原始：无 cross-domain transfer 实验
    - 修改：在 main text 用 1 个小表展示 transfer matrix（ScienceWorld→ALFWorld, ALFWorld→ScienceWorld），报告 accuracy degradation。补充 within-benchmark cross-task transfer（ScienceWorld chemistry→physics, MATH algebra→number theory）作为近距离 transfer 验证。无需额外训练，仅需 inference

14. **[Evaluation — 新增核心 Ablation 至 main text] — 强化方法论可信度** — 命中 Technical Soundness
    - 原始：无 ablation 计划
    - 修改：Main text 2 个核心 ablation：(a) explicit vs implicit routing（同 backbone Qwen2.5-7B，SimGate router vs backbone 自行决定工具调用）；(b) 2-way vs 3-way routing（{internal, deterministic} vs {fast, deep, deterministic}）。Appendix 增加 counterfactual vs heuristic training data ablation

15. **[Evaluation — 新增 Pareto Frontier 可视化] — 支撑效率 claim** — 命中 Experimental Rigor + Clarity
    - 原始：提到 "cost-accuracy Pareto improvement" 但无可视化承诺
    - 修改：每个 track 一张 Pareto 图（x = inference FLOPs / API calls, y = accuracy），同图绘制 always-internal、always-external、heuristic、SimGate。ScienceWorld 和 MATH 的 Pareto 图在 main text，ALFWorld 在 appendix

16. **[Evaluation — Routing Pattern Analysis] — 从无到有，含 router-as-probe 视角** — 命中 Analysis Depth + Insight
    - 原始：提到 "interpretable per-task-category analysis" 但未展开
    - 修改：在 main text 用 ~1/4 页展示 (a) 高不确定性状态是否跨模态一致触发 deterministic routing；(b) episode 内 routing 分布的 phase transition（前期 explore → 后期 exploit）；(c) router-as-probe 角度——聚类 deterministic-computation 步骤揭示 LLM 系统性推理失败模式（如 7B LLM 在多步算术上的失败率模式）

17. **[Evaluation — ScienceWorld 双 Protocol 报告] — 消除 cherry-picking 嫌疑** — 命中 Technical Soundness
    - 原始：仅跟随 CogRouter 的 continuous-score protocol，同时承认 EPO 用不同 protocol
    - 修改：承诺同时报告 CogRouter continuous score 和 EPO binary success rate，所有可复现 baseline 均在两种 protocol 下评估

18. **[Evaluation — Baseline 信息透明化] — 明确 backbone scale** — 命中 Experimental Rigor
    - 原始：列出 baseline 名称但未说明各自 backbone 和 scale
    - 修改：构建 baseline 信息表（method / backbone / scale / training paradigm），明确跨 backbone 比较仅供参考，核心 claim 由同 backbone controlled ablation 支撑

19. **[Evaluation — 计算预算拆分] — 增强可行性论证** — 命中 Feasibility / Reproducibility
    - 原始："Estimated cost: 170-210 H100-hours" 一句话
    - 修改：拆分为 counterfactual data construction（~40-50%）/ router SFT（~20-25%）/ evaluation（~30-35%），讨论 partial rollout 可将 data construction 成本降低 40-60%，与 RL 训练成本对比作为 SFT 方案的 selling point

20. **[Motivation 段落] — 消除 cross-paper 数字比较的自矛盾** — 命中 Technical Soundness
    - 原始：用 ITP-R vs CogRouter 的具体数字差作为 "core evidence"，但同一 proposal 又承认 cross-paper 比较不可靠
    - 修改：将具体数字降级为 "motivating observation"（"these comparisons come from different experimental setups and should be interpreted with caution regarding direction and magnitude rather than exact numbers"），核心 motivation 转为方向性论点（deterministic computation pervasive but no explicit modular routing exists）

21. **[Related Work — 新增 Tool-Augmented LLM Routing 覆盖] — 补全重要遗漏** — 命中 Related Work Coverage
    - 原始：仅覆盖 ITP-R、CogRouter、ReTool、AgentMath、Select-then-Solve、EPO、Dyna-Think
    - 修改：增加 Chameleon（LLM-as-planner routing to diverse tools）、Toolformer（learn when to insert tool calls）、ART（automated tool selection）。明确 SimGate 两点区别：(1) 独立轻量 router vs LLM-as-router；(2) 专注 deterministic computation 子类 vs 混合工具集

22. **[Related Work — 新增 Adaptive Computation 覆盖] — 回应 fast/deep-internal 与 early-exit 方向的重叠** — 命中 Related Work Coverage
    - 原始：仅一句提及 CALM 和 speculative decoding
    - 修改：增加 s1、STILL-2、SkipDecode、LayerSkip 等。明确定位差异：这些方法 route reasoning depth（同一计算模态内的 effort allocation），SimGate 核心 routing 维度是 computation modality（internal vs external），fast/deep-internal 是框架内附属维度。2-way vs 3-way ablation 验证此附属维度的增量收益

23. **[Related Work — Select-then-Solve 定位] — 从"不同"到"正交且可组合"** — 命中 Positioning
    - 原始："differs from Select-then-Solve ... which validates lightweight per-step routing but across reasoning paradigms, not computation modalities"
    - 修改：明确"orthogonal and composable"——SimGate routes internal-vs-external, Select-then-Solve routes among internal strategies, 两者可串联组合

24. **[Related Work — Taxonomy 表] — 新增系统化定位工具** — 命中 Related Work + Clarity
    - 原始：无结构化对比
    - 修改：Appendix 中 taxonomy 表，三轴对比所有 baseline——routing type（explicit modular / implicit in-backbone / LLM-as-router）、tool scope（deterministic-only / mixed）、backbone coupling（decoupled / entangled）

【主要风险】:

1. **Novelty 天花板（最大风险）**: 核心技术（lightweight router + SFT on trajectory data for tool routing）在 ReTool / AgentMath / Select-then-Solve 之后是 incremental。论文的差异化高度依赖两个实验结果：(a) explicit vs implicit routing gap 是否足够大——如果 gap < 2-3pp，reviewer 会认为 "explicit routing 的好处仅是 interpretability，不值得独立发表"；(b) cross-domain transfer 是否成功——如果严重退化，C1 "unified abstraction" 从 demonstrated 变为 proposed-but-unvalidated。这两个结果在实验做出之前无法确定，是概率估计上界受限的根本原因。

2. **Short Paper 内容密度**: 尽管已做大量减法（ALFWorld 降格 appendix、contributions 压缩为 3 条、部分 ablation 移入 appendix），main text 仍然承载 2 个 track + 2 个核心 ablation + Pareto 图 + transfer 表 + routing analysis。4 页主体的实际排版压力仍然大，reviewer 有可能给出 "superficial treatment" 评价。建议在写作阶段严格控制每个 se


## MVP Validation Results

- **Date**: 2026-05-13
- **Hypothesis Supported**: Yes

### Key Metrics

det_vs_internal: boil +30.1, melt +40.15, change-state +40.2, mix-paint +35.5, grow-plant 0.0 | oracle_vs_det: melt +16.7, change-state +15.0, mix-paint +10.0 | significant_tasks: 4/5 (threshold 2/5) | primary_signal: death avoidance (-100 penalty prevention)

### Summary

Phase 0 (forking): 100% success, p95 latency 2.37s. Phase 1 (signal detection): 5 task types tested across 2 GPUs. Primary metric (det vs internal): boil +30.1 [15.5, 45.0], melt +40.15 [25.0, 60.15], change-state +40.2 [25.0, 60.15], mix-paint +35.5 [15.0, 60.0] — all 90% CI lower bound > 0. grow-plant 0.0 (expected control). 4/5 significant, well above 2/5 threshold. Oracle > det confirmed on melt (+16.7), change-state (+15.0), mix-paint (+10.0), supporting selective routing value. Signal primarily from death avoidance (preventing -100 catastrophic failures). Pending: melt/change-state data duplication investigation (won't change PASS — worst case 3/5 still passes).

### Recommendation

GO — 核心假设成立，确定性模拟器在规则驱动任务上显著优于纯 LLM 推理。Oracle > det 进一步证实选择性路由的价值。Research 阶段重点：(1) counterfactual trajectory collection for router SFT training, (2) paper framing 定位为 safety-aware routing to deterministic computation, (3) ScienceWorld 为 primary benchmark, MATH code interpreter 为 secondary。DDL 5/25 紧张但可行。
