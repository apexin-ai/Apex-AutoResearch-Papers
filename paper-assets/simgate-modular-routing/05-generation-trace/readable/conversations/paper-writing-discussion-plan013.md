3	\subsection{Setup}
4	\label{sec:exp-setup}
5	
6	We evaluate on ScienceWorld \cite{scienceworld-2022}, a text-based interactive environment for elementary science tasks with sparse terminal rewards and a $-100$ death penalty. Using the methodology in \S\ref{sec:collection}, we collect 245 episode pairs across 11 task types (20--40 per type). The LLM backbone is Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct served via vLLM with episodes capped at 30 steps.

8	\subsection{Death Avoidance Decomposition}
9	\label{sec:death-decomp}
10

13	\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{fig1_daf_scatter.pdf}
14	\caption{Per-task death rate differential (internal minus deterministic) vs.\ $\Delta_{\text{full}}$. Each point represents one of 11 task types. Regression: $r = 0.9698$ ($p = 8.12 \times 10^{-7}$).}
15	\label{fig:decomposition}
16	\end{figure}
17	
18	The full performance gap between deterministic and internal strategies across 245 episodes is $\Delta_{\text{full}} = +29.60$ points. Excluding all episodes where either strategy results in death, the gap collapses to $\Delta_{\text{no\_death}} = +2.84$. The resulting DAF (\S\ref{sec:daf}) is 90.41\%: approximately 90\% of the deterministic strategy's advantage is attributable to death avoidance.
19	
20	This concentration is consistent across task types. The Pearson correlation between per-task death rate differential and $\Delta_{\text{full}}$ is $r = 0.9698$ ($p = 8.12 \times 10^{-7}$; Figure~\ref{fig:decomposition}). The internal strategy dies in 42.9\% of episodes versus 16.3\% for deterministic---a 2.6$\times$ ratio driving the bulk of the score difference.
21	
22	The label distribution reflects this asymmetry: 86 \texttt{det\_preferred}, 9 \texttt{internal\_preferred}, 150 \texttt{no\_preference}. When internal reasoning does not cause death, it performs comparably to deterministic computation.

1	\section{Conclusion}
2	
3	We presented episode-level counterfactual analysis for diagnosing routing behavior in modular LLM agents. Applied to 245 episodes across 11 ScienceWorld task types, death avoidance accounts for 90.41\% of the routing signal ($\Delta_\text{full}$ = +29.60 vs.\ $\Delta_\text{nd}$ = +2.84), corroborated by near-perfect cross-task correlation ($r$ = 0.9698), oracle degeneracy (96.3\% agreement with always-deterministic), and near-random trained-router accuracy (58.1\%). Future work should extend to step-level counterfactual labeling and evaluate generalization to environments with different failure modes.

1	\section{Method}
2	
3	\subsection{Counterfactual Episode Collection}
4	\label{sec:collection}
5	
6	Per-step oracle labeling assigns routing labels by comparing single-step outcomes under each modality. Under sparse terminal rewards, this degenerates: on ScienceWorld \cite{scienceworld-2022}, 97.4\% of steps produce identical intermediate scores regardless of modality, yielding no routing signal. We instead perform episode-level counterfactual analysis.
7	
8	For each task instance, we execute two complete episodes under identical initial conditions. The \emph{pure-internal} episode follows the ReAct paradigm \cite{react-2023}, where the LLM interleaves chain-of-thought reasoning with environment actions. The \emph{pure-deterministic} episode uses the environment simulator to compute exact state transitions. In both cases the LLM selects which action to take; deterministic computation replaces only the state-transition prediction---equivalent to giving the agent a perfect world model.
9	
10	Each episode pair produces a tuple $(s^{\text{int}}, s^{\text{det}}, d^{\text{int}}, d^{\text{det}})$, where $s$ denotes the terminal score and $d \in \{0,1\}$ indicates agent death. Episodes are capped at 30 steps. The LLM backbone is Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct served via vLLM. ScienceWorld spans 30 task types with a $-100$ death penalty; after prescreening, we collect 245 episode pairs across 11 task types (20--40 per type).
11	
12	\subsection{Death-Aware Labeling}
13	\label{sec:labeling}
14	
15	Each counterfactual pair receives an episode-level routing label based on $(s^{\text{int}}, s^{\text{det}}, d^{\text{int}}, d^{\text{det}})$. Scores are integer-valued, so we use exact (in)equality. The label is assigned by four mutually exclusive cases:
16	
17	\begin{enumerate}
18	    \item \textbf{Death asymmetry}: $d^{\text{int}} \neq d^{\text{det}}$ $\rightarrow$ surviving strategy preferred.
19	    \item \textbf{Both dead}: $d^{\text{int}} = d^{\text{det}} = 1$ $\rightarrow$ \texttt{no\_p

2. **排除数据** — 61.2% tied episodes excluded, 分 both-alive/both-dead
3. **训练 label 审计** — 95 labels 全部 genuine，按 death asymmetry / score comparison 分解
4. **Strict-only retrain** — balanced_acc within 1σ，score-comparison labels 贡献可忽略
5. **Step-level tie rate** — 97.4% 引用 §2.1，motivate episode-level approach
