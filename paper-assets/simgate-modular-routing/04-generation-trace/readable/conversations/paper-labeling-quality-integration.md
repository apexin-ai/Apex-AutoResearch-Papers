## How to read this transcript

`User` marks a recorded user-role instruction, `Assistant` marks an agent response, and the collapsible `Tool call` / `Tool result` blocks show the actions and observations between them. A user-role record may come from another agent or the runtime system; it is not an authorship label.

13	The full performance gap between deterministic and internal strategies across 245 episodes is $\Delta_{\text{full}} = +29.60$ points. When we exclude all episodes where either strategy results in agent death, the gap collapses to $\Delta_{\text{no\_death}} = +2.84$. The resulting Death Avoidance Factor (\S\ref{sec:daf}) is 90.41\%: approximately 90\% of the deterministic strategy's advantage over internal reasoning is attributable to death avoidance rather than superior task performance when both agents survive.
14	
15	This concentration is consistent across task types. The Pearson correlation between per-task death rate differential (internal minus deterministic) and $\Delta_{\text{full}}$ is $r = 0.9698$ ($p = 8.12 \times 10^{-7}$), as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:decomposition}. Knowing how much more frequently the internal strategy dies is nearly sufficient to predict the full performance gap for a given task type. The internal strategy dies in 42.9\% of episodes compared to 16.3\% for deterministic computation---a 2.6$\times$ ratio that drives the bulk of the observed score difference.

17	The episode-level label distribution reflects this asymmetry: of 245 episodes, 86 are \texttt{det\_preferred}, only 9 \texttt{internal\_preferred}, and 150 \texttt{no\_preference}---when internal reasoning does not cause death, it performs comparably to deterministic computation.

1	\section{Conclusion}
2	
3	We introduce episode-level counterfactual analysis for understanding routing between LLM internal reasoning and deterministic computation, overcoming per-step oracle degeneracy (98.2\% tie rate) in sparse-reward settings. On 11 ScienceWorld task types (245 episodes), death avoidance accounts for 90.41\% of routing signal ($\Delta_{\text{full}} = +29.60 \rightarrow \Delta_{\text{no\_death}} = +2.84$; $r = 0.9698$, $p = 8.12 \times 10^{-7}$). The value of deterministic computation is predominantly concentrated in preventing catastrophic failures.
4	
5	\paragraph{Limitations and Future Work.} Our analysis uses a single benchmark (ScienceWorld) with a single LLM backbone (Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct). ScienceWorld's $-100$ death penalty may amplify the death avoidance signal; environments with less catastrophic failure modes could exhibit lower DAF values. Our counterfactual labels operate at episode granularity, limiting router training resolution. Cross-seed instability in internal recall (51.5--81.8\%) warrants further investigation. Step-level labeling with denser rewards (e.g., DAgger-style \cite{dagger-2011} imitation learning) could improve both decomposition and router training. Extension to code-interpreter routing and multi-LLM evaluation would test generalization beyond simulator-based environments.
