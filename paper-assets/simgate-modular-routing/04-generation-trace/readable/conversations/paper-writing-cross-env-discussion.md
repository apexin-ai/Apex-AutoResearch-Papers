3	\subsection{Setup}
4	\label{sec:exp-setup}
5	
6	We evaluate on ScienceWorld \cite{scienceworld-2022}, a text-based interactive environment for elementary science tasks with sparse terminal rewards and a $-100$ death penalty. Using the methodology in \S\ref{sec:collection}, we collect 245 episode pairs across 11 task types (20--40 per type). The LLM backbone is Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct served via vLLM with episodes capped at 30 steps.

8	\subsection{Death Avoidance Decomposition}
9	\label{sec:death-decomp}
10	
11	\begin{figure}[t]
12	\centering
13	\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{fig1_daf_scatter.pdf}
14	\caption{Per-task death rate differential (internal minus deterministic) vs.\ $\Delta_{\text{full}}$. Each point represents one of 11 task types. Regression: $r = 0.9698$ ($p = 8.12 \times 10^{-7}$).}
15	\label{fig:decomposition}
16	\end{figure}
17	
18	The full performance gap between deterministic and internal strategies across 245 episodes is $\Delta_{\text{full}} = +29.60$ points. Excluding all episodes where either strategy results in death, the gap collapses to $\Delta_{\text{no\_death}} = +2.84$. The resulting DAF (\S\ref{sec:daf}) is 90.41\%: approximately 90\% of the deterministic strategy's advantage is attributable to death avoidance.
19	
20	This concentration is consistent across task types. The Pearson correlation between per-task death rate differential and $\Delta_{\text{full}}$ is $r = 0.9698$ ($p = 8.12 \times 10^{-7}$; Figure~\ref{fig:decomposition}). The internal strategy dies in 42.9\% of episodes versus 16.3\% for deterministic---a 2.6$\times$ ratio driving the bulk of the score difference.
21	
22	The label distribution reflects this asymmetry: 86 \texttt{det\_preferred}, 9 \texttt{internal\_preferred}, 150 \texttt{no\_preference}. When internal reasoning does not cause death, it performs comparably to deterministic computation.

1	\section{Conclusion}
2	
3	We presented episode-level counterfactual analysis for diagnosing routing behavior in modular LLM agents. Applied to 245 episodes across 11 ScienceWorld task types, death avoidance accounts for 90.41\% of the routing signal ($\Delta_\text{full}$ = +29.60 vs.\ $\Delta_\text{nd}$ = +2.84), corroborated by near-perfect cross-task correlation ($r$ = 0.9698), oracle degeneracy (96.3\% agreement with always-deterministic), and near-random trained-router accuracy (58.1\%). Future work should extend to step-level counterfactual labeling and evaluate generalization to environments with different failure modes.

27	\paragraph{Labeling quality.}
28	A potential concern is oracle circularity: whether episode-level labels reflect tie-breaking artifacts rather than genuine modality differences. We audit all 245 labels. Of the 150 \texttt{no\_preference} labels (61.2\%), 115 (46.9\%) are both-alive ties and 35 (14.3\%) are both-dead---all excluded from router training. The remaining 95 training labels are entirely genuine: 75 from death asymmetry (70 deterministic-preferred, 5 internal-preferred) and 20 from score comparison with both strategies surviving (16 deterministic-preferred, 4 internal-preferred). Zero labels depend on tie-breaking. Retraining the router using only death-asymmetry labels yields balanced accuracy of 57.3\%, within 1$\sigma$ of the full-label retrain (57.6 $\pm$ 0.5\%), confirming that score-comparison labels contribute negligible additional signal. The 97.4\% step-level tie rate (\S\ref{sec:collection}) further motivates episode-l

25	
26	Our analysis uses a single benchmark (ScienceWorld) with a single LLM backbone (Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct), and generalization to other interactive environments and model scales remains to be established. The $-100$ death penalty may amplify DAF; environments with less catastrophic penalties could exhibit lower DAF, though the qualitative finding may still hold. Step-level labeling with denser rewards is a natural extension. The logit--generation gap in the implicit router warrants further investigation.
27	
28	\paragraph{Labeling quality.}
29	A potential concern is oracle circularity: whether episode-level labels reflect tie-breaking artifacts rather than genuine modality differences. We audit all 245 labels. Of the 150 \texttt{no\_preference} labels (61.2\%), 115 (46.9\%) are both-alive ties and 35 (14.3\%) are both-dead---all excluded from router training. The remaining 95 training labels are entirely genuine: 75 from death asymmetry (70 deterministic-preferred, 5 internal-preferred) and 20 from score comparison with both strategies surviving (16 deterministic-preferred, 4 internal-preferred). Zero labels depend on tie-breaking. Retraining the router using only death-asymmetry labels yields balanced accuracy of 57.3\%, within 1$\sigma$ of the full-label retrain (57.6 $\pm$ 0.5\%), confirming that score-comparison labels contribute negligible additional signal. The 97.4\% step-level tie rate (\S\ref{sec:collection}) furth

3	We presented episode-level counterfactual analysis for diagnosing routing behavior in modular LLM agents. Applied to 245 episodes across 11 ScienceWorld task types, death avoidance accounts for 90.41\% of the routing signal ($\Delta_\text{full}$ = +29.60 vs.\ $\Delta_\text{nd}$ = +2.84), corroborated by near-perfect cross-task correlation ($r$ = 0.9698), oracle degeneracy (96.3\% agreement with always-deterministic), and near-random trained-router accuracy (58.1\%). Future work should extend to step-level counterfactual labeling and evaluate generalization to environments with different failure modes.

55	\label{sec:router-diagnostic}
56	
57	We investigate whether episode-level counterfactual labels can train a step-level router, as a diagnostic probe rather than a routing system proposal.
58	
59	\paragraph{Classification head.} A linear head appended to the LLM's hidden representations degenerates to always-deterministic (0\% internal recall) across all configurations (class weighting, focal loss, undersampling, temperature scaling).
60	
61	\paragraph{Implicit router.} We fine-tune Qwen3-1.7B to internalize routing decisions. Training configuration significantly affects results. With gradient accumulation GA=8 (effective batch size 32), the model achieves generation accuracy of 65.4\% with internal recall of 51.5\%---the only non-degenerate configuration. With GA=1 (effective batch size 4), logit-level accuracy reaches 74.5\% (balanced accuracy 79\%), but generation degenerates to 53.3\% accuracy with only 26.7\% internal recall---a 21.2 percentage point logit--generation gap. Effective batch size determines whether learned patterns transfer to generation.
62	
63	Across four seeds (GA=8), balanced accuracy is $58.1 \pm 0.8\%$---8 points above chance. Internal recall varies from 51.5\% to 81.8\%, indicating seed-dependent boundaries with consistent weak discriminability. End-to-end (Table~\ref{tab:baselines}): the router's 97.0\% simulator invocation ratio means it routes internally only 3\% of the time---weak signal with unstable thresholds, consistent with minimal routing structure beyond death avoidance.

1	\section{Discussion}
2	\label{sec:discussion}
3	
4	\paragraph{Cross-environment evidence.}
5	The death-avoidance finding in ScienceWorld raises a natural question: does routing signal persist in environments without catastrophic failure? A preliminary 50-problem pilot on MATH Level~4--5, using code interpreter as the deterministic modality, suggests not. Internal reasoning achieved 80\% accuracy versus 72\% for code interpreter, with 88\% of problems showing no modality preference (label distribution: 1 deterministic-preferred, 5 internal-preferred, 44 no-preference). In the absence of death risk, the routing signal vanishes or reverses---consistent with death avoidance as the primary driver of the deterministic strategy's advantage observed in ScienceWorld. A larger-scale replication with improved code execution (addressing sandbox limitations in the pilot) is in progress.
6	
7	% TODO: Replace pilot-50 numbers with math-200-fixed results when available
8	
9	\paragraph{Scope and future directions.}
10	Our analysis is grounded in a single interactive environment with a specific failure mode (the $-100$ death penalty). Extending the counterfactual methodology to environments with graded failure costs, embodied agents with continuous action spaces, or multi-turn dialogue systems would clarify how broadly death avoidance---or analogous catastrophic-failure avoidance---accounts for apparent routing signal. Step-level counterfactual labeling, rather than episode-level, is a complementary direction that could reveal finer-grained routing structure masked by our current aggregation.
11	
12	% TODO: ALFWorld results pending; add cross-environment comparison if signal emerges

完成。变更总结：

**已做的修改：**

1. **experiments.tex** — 移除了 §5.5 Cross-Environment Validation（原本放在 Experiments 里，不符合 D046 决策）

2. **discussion.tex** — 新建 Discussion section（§6），包含：
   - `Cross-environment evidence` 段：MATH pilot-50 结果，所有数字均来自 registry（80% vs 72%, 44/50 no-preference），framing 为 "preliminary pilot"，明确说 larger-scale replication in progress
   - `Scope and future directions` 段：泛化方向讨论（graded failure costs、embodied agents、step-level labeling），ALFWorld 的 TODO placeholder 留在注释中
   - 两处 `% TODO` 注释标记待更新位置

3. **main.tex** — 在 related_work 和 conclusion 之间插入 `\input{discussion}`

4. **conclusion.tex** — 末句从 "Future work should extend..." 改为引用 §Discussion 的 cross-environment evidence，呼应 analysis paper 主线

**Framing 检查：** Discussion 全程以 "the finding generalizes / doesn't generalize" 为主语（analysis 视角），未暗示 routing method proposal。MATH 结果描述为 "preliminary pilot"，未使用 math-200-fixed 未出的数据。ALFWorld 无定量内容，仅以注释 placeholder 存在。
