1	\section{Schema Decomposition: Failure, Diagnosis, and Mitigation}
2	\label{sec:sdgd}
3	
4	A natural intervention against confusability-driven degradation is to partition the schema so that confusable types never co-occur in the same prompt. We test this idea with \textbf{Schema-DAG-Guided Decomposition} (SDGD\footnote{SDGD (Schema Decomposition and Grouping for Degradation mitigation) is an adopted abbreviation for schema decomposition and grouping; the graph structure is undirected.}), which uses greedy graph coloring on the pairwise SCS graph to assign types to low-confusability batches.
5	
6	We construct a thresholded confusability graph $G = (V, E)$ where each type is a vertex and an edge connects types $t_i, t_j$ whenever $\text{SCS}(t_i, t_j) > \tau$. Greedy graph coloring (\textsc{largest\_first}) assigns each type to a color such that no two adjacent---i.e., highly confusable---types share a batch. Each color class forms one extraction batch. For NER, predictions from all batches are merged via set union; for RE, each instance is routed to the batch containing its gold type (oracle routing). We test four NER modes: (i)~\textbf{single\_pass}, the undecomposed baseline; (ii)~\textbf{sdgd\_zero}, SCS-guided partitioning; (iii)~\textbf{random\_batch}, random partitioning with matched batch sizes; and (iv)~\textbf{per\_type}, each type extracted in isolation. Every mode falls below the single-pass NER baseline: SDGD obtains F1\,=\,0.251, random batching 0.320, per-type 0.292, versus 0.445 for single-pass (Table~\ref{tab:sdgd_results}, Appendix~\ref{sec:appendix_sdgd}).
7	
8	\paragraph{Merge amplification in NER.}
9	The core failure mechanism is \emph{merge amplification}: presenting the same text to the model $k$ times with different type subsets causes each pass to independently generate entity predictions, and union merge accumulates all of them into a single output. Each pass produces an independent set of span predictions; because LLM outputs are not calibrated across passes \cite{llm-calibration-survey-2024}, the same span may receive conflicting type labels from different passes, or hallucinated entities may appear in passes where the correct type is absent. Union merge retains all predictions, so false positives scale with $k$ while true positives are bounded by the fixed set of gold entities.
10	
11	Quantitatively, single-pass precision (0.563) collapses to 0.210--0.249 after union merge across 8 batches, while recall gains are modest (0.368 $\to$ 0.314 for sdgd\_zero, 0.446 for random batch). The net F1 loss is substantial: 0.445 $\to$ 0.251 (sdgd\_zero) or 0.320 (random batch). Per-type extraction (66 batches) pushes recall to 0.586 but precision to 0.194 (F1\,=\,0.292), confirming that the precision--recall imbalance intensifies with the number of passes. Random batching outperforms confusability-aware SDGD on NER (0.320 vs.\ 0.251) because the dominant degradation source---merge amplification---is independent of batch composition; any multi-pass scheme suffers from it regardless of grouping quality.
12	
13	\paragraph{Confidence gating does not resolve merge amplification.}
14	Confidence-based gating (retaining only predictions above threshold) trades recall for precision but does not recover net F1 (0.251$\to$0.241), confirming that merge artifacts are systemic rather than confined to low-confidence predictions (Appendix~\ref{sec:appendix_sdgd}).
15	
16	\paragraph{Why NER fails but RE does not.}
17	Merge amplification is specific to span-level tasks. Each NER pass independently proposes entity spans, and union merge must resolve conflicting boundaries and type assignments, degrading systematically with pass count. RE avoids this mechanism entirely: under oracle routing, each relation instance receives a single classification from the batch containing its gold type, requiring no span reconciliation and eliminating the multi-pass interference that causes SDGD to fail on NER. This makes RE a clean testbed for evaluating whether confusability-aware decomposition improves accuracy once merge artifacts are removed.
18	
19	\enlargethispage*{9\baselineskip}
20	\paragraph{Oracle routing as performance ceiling.}
21	Oracle routing routes each test instance to the batch containing its gold type, eliminating cross-type confusion within each batch. On FewRel 80-relation RE, oracle-routed decomposition achieves 0.802 accuracy versus 0.504 for the single-pass baseline---a gain of +29.8\,pp (Table~\ref{tab:batch_composition}). This is the strongest positive finding of the decomposition experiments: it demonstrates that type confusability is indeed a key driver of degradation in RE, and that performance recovers substantially when confusable types are separated.
22	
23	However, oracle routing requires gold labels and is not deployable. The gap between the oracle ceiling and practical routing reveals an important asymmetry: while \emph{any} decomposition benefits enormously from removing the 80-type bottleneck (+28.4\,pp for random batching, +29.8\,pp for graph coloring), the \emph{additional} benefit of confusability-aware grouping over random grouping is modest (+1.4\,pp, $p \approx 0.19$). The confusability-aware strategy ranks 13th out of 15 random seeds, limited by the narrow BCS margin (0.006) between graph-coloring and random batches at this partition granularity. Finer-grained partitioning or alternative confusability metrics may be needed to translate the oracle-demonstrated potential into significant practical gains.

1	\section{Introduction}
2	\label{sec:introduction}
3	
4	Training-free\footnote{We use ``training-free'' and ``zero-shot'' interchangeably to denote prompting without parameter updates.}\footnote{Code and data will be released upon acceptance. Anonymous review materials: \url{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/schema-dag-extraction}} LLM information extraction---prompting a large language model with a target schema and asking it to extract structured information without any task-specific fine-tuning---enables rapid deployment across new domains and ontologies. This zero-shot paradigm eliminates the need for labeled data, making it attractive for applications where annotation is expensive or schemas evolve frequently \cite{llm4ie-survey-2024}. Yet the paradigm carries a critical limitation: performance degrades sharply as the number of candidate types in the prompt schema grows. On named entity recognition, recall drops from 0.72 with a single candidate type to a plateau of ${\sim}$0.27 across intermediate schema sizes (22--44 types) before partial recovery at full-schema. On relation extraction, accuracy falls from 85.7\% with one relation to 49.5\% with 80 relations (sentence-level) and from 88.0\% to 38.7\% with 96 relations (document-level)---near or exceeding halving. This degradation is not academic: real-world ontologies routinely define 50--200+ types, placing them squarely in the regime where training-free extraction becomes unreliable.
5	
6	What explains this degradation? Prior decomposition strategies \cite{uniner-2024,llm-pee-2025,parse-2025} conflate two mechanisms: having more types to discriminate among (count) and having semantically similar types to confuse (confusability) (hereafter Channel~1 and Channel~2).

8	We ask three questions. \textbf{RQ1}: Does type confusability independently predict extraction degradation beyond the effect of type count? \textbf{RQ2}: Through what mechanisms do count and confusability each degrade performance? \textbf{RQ3}: Can confusability-aware schema decomposition improve extraction quality?
9	
10	To our knowledge, we present the first controlled study isolating type confusability from type count via stratified design in zero-shot LLM IE, spanning NER, RE, and event detection (ED). We operationalize confusability via the \emph{Schema Confusability Score} (SCS)---pairwise embedding cosine similarity---and its batch-level aggregation, the \emph{Batch Confusability Score} (BCS). We evaluate on Few-NERD \cite{fewnerd-2021}, FewRel \cite{fewrel-2018}, DocRED \cite{docred-2019}, and MAVEN \cite{maven-2020} using Qwen3-32B (\S\ref{sec:experimental_setup}).
11	
12	Our experiments yield five findings: (1)~degradation operates through two channels---count-driven recall decline (up to $-$49\,pp at intermediate schema sizes for document-level RE) and confusability-driven type substitution (typical-batch gap ${\approx}\,2.2$\,pp; quartile $\Delta = -5.3$\,pp)---an asymmetric relationship where count dominates, consistent with bounded interaction in RE (TOST $p = 0.003$ at $\pm 3$\,pp) but coupled in NER where NER recall exhibits non-monotonic recovery at full-schema; (2)~pairwise SCS predicts type confusion ($r = 0.112$--$0.129$), the first factor empirically isolated in controlled zero-shot IE; (3)~effects are consistent across schema sizes and granularities (BCS slopes: $p = 0.60$; DocRED: slope $= -0.71$, $R^2 = 0.53$), and directionally consistent across prompt designs, with attenuated magnitude under improved prompts; (4)~per-type aggregation is confounded by centrality on homogeneous schemas; (5)~NER decomposition fails due to merge amplification; RE confusability-aware grouping yields no significant improvement over random (+1.4\,pp, $p \approx 0.19$, n.s.) despite oracle routing recovering +29.8\,pp.
13	
14	Our contributions are:
15	\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*,itemsep=2pt,topsep=2pt]
16	    \item \textbf{Count dominates confusability by ${\sim}20\times$ in typical batches.} Through stratified design isolating count from confusability, we show count effects ($-$42\% to $-$56\% recall) dwarf typical confusability effects (2.2\,pp), counter to decomposition literature's implicit assumption that confusability is the primary bottleneck. Interaction is bounded (TOST $p = 0.003$ at $\pm 3$\,pp) in RE but not in NER, where boundary and type ambiguity couple (\S\ref{sec:multi_channel}).
17	\item \textbf{Pairwise embedding similarity predicts type confusion.} SCS correlates with confusion rates ($r = 0.112$--$0.129$), with centrality confound identified on homogeneous schemas---invalidating naive per-type aggregation (\S\ref{sec:scs-validation}).
18	\item \textbf{BCS generalizes across tasks.} BCS--accuracy slopes are consistent across schema sizes ($p = 0.60$) and replicate at document level (DocRED: $R^2 = 0.22\text{--}0.53$) (\S\ref{sec:bcs_controlled}).
19	\item \textbf{Schema decomposition exposes merge limitations.} Naive merge strategies (union, confidence-gated) collapse NER precision from 0.56 to 0.21; confusability-aware RE grouping yields no significant improvement (+1.4\,pp, $p \approx 0.19$, rank 13/15 random seeds) despite oracle ceiling (+29.8\,pp), leaving routing as an open challenge (\S\ref{sec:sdgd}).

Anonymous review materials: \\url{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/schema-dag-extraction}} LLM information extraction---prompting a large language model with a target schema and asking it to extract structured information without any task-specific fine-tuning---enables rapid deployment across new domains and ontologies. This zero-shot paradigm eliminates the need for labeled data, making it attractive for applications where annotation is expensive or schemas evolve frequently \\cite{llm4ie-survey-2024}. Yet the paradigm carries a critical limitation: performance degrades sharply as the number of candidate types in the prompt schema grows. On named entity recognition, recall drops from 0.72 with a single candidate type to a plateau of ${\\sim}$0.27 across intermediate schema sizes (22--44 types) before partial recovery at full-schema. On relation extraction, accuracy falls from 85.7\\% with one relation to 49.5\\% with 80 relations (sentence-level) and from 88.0\\% to 38.7\\% with 96 relations (document-level)---near or exceeding halving. This degradation is not academic: real-world ontologies routinely define 50--200+ types, placing them squarely in the regime where training-free extraction becomes unreliable.\n\nWhat explains this degradation? Prior decomposition strategies \\cite{uniner-2024,llm-pee-2025,parse-2025} conflate two mechanisms: having more types to discriminate among (count) and having semantically similar types to confuse (confusability) (hereafter Channel~1 and Channel~2).

2	Training-free LLM information extraction degrades as schema complexity grows. To our knowledge, we present the first controlled study isolating type confusability from type count in zero-shot LLM IE, spanning NER, RE, and event detection across four datasets. We introduce the Schema Confusability Score (SCS) and two experimental paradigms: count curves (varying schema size while randomizing confusability) and BCS-controlled experiments (fixing size while varying confusability).

4	We identify two degradation channels: count-driven recall decline and confusability-driven type substitution. In typical random batches, confusability accounts for ${\approx}\,2.2$\,pp accuracy difference---markedly smaller than count effects ($-$49\,pp for document-level RE)---while batch-level BCS explains 22--53\% of cross-batch variance. The channels exhibit bounded interaction in RE (TOST $p = 0.003$ at $\pm 3$\,pp) but are coupled in NER where boundary and type ambiguity interact. Effects are directionally consistent across prompt designs and model scales, though Channel~2 attenuates on smaller models. Schema decomposition via oracle routing recovers substantial RE gains, but confusability-aware grouping yields no significant improvement over random.

85	\section{SDGD Full Protocol and Results}
86	\label{sec:appendix_sdgd}
87	
88	We construct a thresholded confusability graph $G = (V, E)$ where each type is a vertex and an edge connects types $t_i, t_j$ whenever $\text{SCS}(t_i, t_j) > \tau$. Greedy graph coloring (\textsc{largest\_first}) assigns each type to a color such that no two adjacent---i.e., highly confusable---types share a color. Each color class forms one extraction batch, and predictions are merged via set union. We compare four modes: (i)~\textbf{single\_pass}, the undecomposed baseline; (ii)~\textbf{sdgd\_zero}, SCS-guided partitioning; (iii)~\textbf{random\_batch}, random partitioning with matched batch sizes; and (iv)~\textbf{per\_type}, the extreme case where each type is extracted in isolation.
89	
90	Single-pass extraction achieves F1\,=\,0.445 (P\,=\,0.563, R\,=\,0.368). SDGD obtains F1\,=\,0.251 (P\,=\,0.210, R\,=\,0.314), a 44\% relative drop. Random batching reaches F1\,=\,0.320 (P\,=\,0.249, R\,=\,0.446), and per-type extraction yields F1\,=\,0.292 (P\,=\,0.194, R\,=\,0.586). Every decomposition mode falls below the single-pass baseline (Table~\ref{tab:sdgd_results}).
91

111	\label{tab:sdgd_results}
112	\end{table}
113	
114	Decomposition boosts recall (per-type recall reaches 0.586 versus single-pass 0.368) but devastates precision (0.194 versus 0.563). When the same text is presented to the model $k$ times with different type subsets, each pass independently generates entity predictions. Because LLM outputs are not calibrated across passes, the union merge step accumulates overlapping and contradictory predictions, inflating false positives.
115	
116	Our v2 merge ranks competing predictions by the LLM's self-reported confidence and retains only the highest-scoring candidate for each span. Confidence gating improves precision (sdgd\_zero: 0.210$\to$0.324; random\_batch: 0.249$\to$0.331), but at the cost of disproportionate recall loss (0.314$\to$0.191; 0.446$\to$0.276), yielding lower F1 in both modes (sdgd\_zero: 0.251$\to$0.241; random\_batch: 0.320$\to$0.301).
117	
118	\section{Factorial Analysis and Separability Test}
119	\label{sec:appendix_factorial}
120	
121	To formally test whether count and confusability effects are additive, we fit a multiple regression (accuracy $\sim$ $\log_2$\,count $+$ BCS $+$ count$\times$BCS) across 69 batches from FewRel spanning five count levels ($k \in \{4, 8, 16, 32, 40\}$). Both main effects are significant (count: $p = 0.008$; BCS: $p = 0.0002$; $R^2 = 0.52$), but the interaction term is negligible (0.47\,pp). A TOST equivalence test with a $\pm 3$\,pp margin confirms that the interaction is bounded well below practical significance ($p_{\text{TOST}} = 0.003$), supporting bounded interaction between count and confusability effects.
122	
123	A separate within-dataset $2 \times 2$ factorial on FewRel (count $\in \{8, 16\}$, BCS low/high; $n = 54$) did not reach equivalence ($p_{\text{TOST}} = 0.56$), likely due to limited power from fewer count levels and narrower BCS contrast. The Few-NERD factorial (\S\ref{sec:multi_channel}) similarly did not reach significance ($p = 0.50$). The regression approach provides the stronger test by leveraging the full count range.
124	
125	\paragraph{Equivalence margin justification.}
126	We set $\pm 3$\,pp as the smallest interaction that would materially alter practitioner decisions: a 3\,pp interaction atop the 2.2\,pp confusability main effect would represent ${>}130\%$ amplification, fundamentally changing whether confusability warrants mitigation. At $\pm 2$\,pp (marginally equivalent, $p = 0.047$), interaction remains bounded below the main effect itself.

147	
148	The quartile $\Delta$ for 80-pool 16-relation subsets ($-$3.92\,pp, 95\% CI [$-$8.17, $+$0.38]) crosses zero, reflecting the compressed BCS range within that pool (0.46--0.68 vs.\ 0.48--0.71 for the independent pool). Within this narrow band, the quartile contrast lacks statistical power to detect the effect that the regression identifies. The full 80-relation condition ($n = 25$) is underpowered for both the slope (CI: [$-$1.303, $+$1.695]) and quartile analyses; we include it in Table~\ref{tab:within_pool} for completeness but do not draw inferential conclusions from it.

150	\section{Controlling for Centrality Confounds in MAVEN Per-Type Analysis}
151	\label{sec:appendix_residualized_bcs}
152	
153	Section~\ref{sec:centrality_confound} identifies a centrality confound in MAVEN's per-type BCS--F1 correlation: both embeddings show a \emph{positive} raw correlation, opposite to the expected direction. Here we formalize this analysis by identifying specific confounders for each embedding and testing whether the BCS--F1 relationship survives partial correlation controlling for these confounders.
154	
155	\paragraph{Confound identification.}
156	For each embedding, we computed the correlation between mean BCS and candidate confounders (type frequency, degree centrality at threshold 0.7) across MAVEN's 149 active event types. The dominant confound differs by embedding:
157	\begin{itemize}[itemsep=2pt,leftmargin=*]
158	\item \textbf{MiniLM}: BCS correlates with log type frequency ($r = 0.201$). Frequent types have more training signal and are extracted more reliably, producing the positive BCS--F1 association.
159	\item \textbf{Qwen3}: BCS correlates strongly with degree centrality ($r = 0.854$). In the Qwen3 embedding space, high-BCS types are those with many semantic neighbors---central, well-represented types that the model extracts well.
160	\end{itemize}
161	
162	\paragraph{Partial correlation results.}
163	Table~\ref{tab:residualized_bcs} reports raw Spearman $\rho$ and partial Pearson $r$ after controlling for the identified confounders. Under single-variable control, both correlations weaken to non-significance. Under joint control (log frequency $+$ degree centrality simultaneously), neither embedding retains a significant BCS--F1 association.

183	\label{tab:residualized_bcs}
184	\end{table}
185	
186	\paragraph{Interpretation.}
187	The two embeddings encode different aspects of the same underlying confound. MiniLM, a smaller sentence encoder, produces a tighter embedding cluster for MAVEN's FrameNet-derived types; here, type frequency is the primary confounder because frequent types accumulate higher mean similarity to the dense cluster. Qwen3, with a larger representation space, differentiates types enough that frequency is not the dominant factor, but degree centrality---the count of strong semantic neighbors---becomes the confound instead. In both cases, the positive raw correlation reflects a centrality artifact: types that are semantically central are both high-BCS and easy to extract.
188	
189	Under joint control, both embeddings yield $p > 0.2$, confirming that the raw positive BCS--F1 correlation on MAVEN is fully attributable to centrality-related confounders. This does not invalidate the confusability hypothesis; the pairwise SCS--confusion correlation on MAVEN remains significant (MiniLM $r = 0.129$, $p < 0.001$; Table~\ref{tab:pairwise}). Rather, it demonstrates that per-type aggregation (mean BCS) conflates confusability with centrality in semantically homogeneous schemas, and that pairwise analysis or explicit confound adjustment is required in such settings.

198	\section{Prompt Version Sensitivity Analysis}
199	\label{sec:appendix_prompt_sensitivity}
200	
201	We assess whether the confusability effects reported in \S\ref{sec:bcs_controlled}--\ref{sec:multi_channel} are robust to prompt design by replicating key experiments under the v2 prompt (\S\ref{sec:model}; full templates in Appendix~\ref{sec:appendix_prompts}).
202	
203	\paragraph{RE (FewRel).}
204	Under the v1 prompt, the extreme-batch BCS gap (Table~\ref{tab:bcs_controlled}) is substantial. Under v2, with $n{=}25$ batches per group and wider BCS contrast (low-BCS range [0.356, 0.367]; high-BCS range [0.791, 0.811]), the gap is $-$25.5\,pp (low-BCS 85.2\% vs.\ high-BCS 59.7\%; 95\% CI: [22.4, 28.6]; $p < 0.001$; Pearson $r = -0.919$). The effect is significant, directionally consistent with v1, and only modestly attenuated in magnitude ($-$5.7\,pp reduction). An earlier $n{=}5$ evaluation with narrower BCS contrast (0.21) yielded a smaller gap of $-$7.9\,pp (CI: [$-$5.2, $+$21.5]), illustrating how limited statistical power and restricted BCS range can obscure the underlying signal---a cautionary note for small-sample prompt sensitivity studies.
205	
206	\paragraph{NER (Few-NERD).}
207	The batch-level BCS--F1 correlation under v2 is consistent with v1: at count${}\,=\,12$, $r = +0.58$ ($p = 0.002$, 95\% CI: [0.19, 0.81]) vs.\ v1 $r = +0.50$ ($p = 0.008$). As discussed in \S\ref{sec:pairwise}, this positive direction reflects a type-frequency confound at the batch level---high-BCS batches contain high-frequency entity types that models extract more reliably---rather than evidence against the confusability hypothesis. The pairwise SCS--confusion analysis (\S\ref{sec:pairwise}), which is immune to this aggregation artifact, remains the primary evidence for the NER confusability channel.
208	
209	\paragraph{Interpretation.}
210	The $n{=}25$ v2 result confirms that the confusability effect is directionally consistent across prompt designs, with attenuated magnitude: the gap narrows ($-$5.7\,pp) but remains highly significant ($p < 0.001$, $r = -0.919$). The earlier $n{=}5$ non-significance reflected insufficient power and narrow BCS contrast, not absence of the effect. V2's stricter format constraints raise the baseline accuracy (low-BCS 85.2\% vs.\ 82.3\%), but type confusion under high confusability persists (59.7\% vs.\ 51.0\%). Prompt design modulates the practical magnitude of the confusability effect but does not eliminate it, ruling out prompt-specific confounding as the primary driver. The underlying confusability signal---pairwise SCS--confusion correlation and the directional BCS--accuracy relationship---persists across both prompt versions.
211	
212	\section{BCS Aggregation Sensitivity}
213	\label{sec:appendix_bcs_sensitivity}
214	
215	We define Batch Confusability Score (BCS) as the \emph{mean} pairwise SCS across all type pairs in a batch (\S\ref{sec:bcs_controlled}). An alternative definition takes the \emph{maximum} pairwise SCS within each batch, capturing the single most confusable pair. Here we compare both aggregation methods to verify that core conclusions are robust to this choice.

233	\label{tab:bcs_aggregation}
234	\end{table}
235	
236	MAX aggregation yields stronger correlations ($r = -0.637$ vs.\ $-0.467$ for 16-rel), consistent with the hypothesis that the single most confusable pair in a batch predicts substitution errors. Both definitions produce significant negative slopes across all conditions, and the permutation tests confirm no significant difference between independent and sampled pools under either definition. We adopt MEAN as the primary definition because it better represents average pairwise difficulty across all schema combinations, while MAX may overweight a single outlier pair. The choice does not affect any paper conclusion.

261	A potential confound in the cross-scale comparison is that the 16-relation and 80-relation pools contain different types, so the observed gap could reflect pool composition rather than confusability. To control for this, we draw 100 random 16-relation subsets from the 80-relation pool and evaluate under the same BCS-controlled protocol.

285	The within-pool slope ($-$0.401, CI excludes zero) is statistically indistinguishable from the independent 16-relation pool ($-$0.509; permutation $p \approx 0.60$). The smaller quartile gap ($-$3.92\,pp vs.\ $-$5.31\,pp) reflects the narrower BCS range within the 80-relation pool (Appendix~\ref{sec:appendix_within_pool}).
286	
287	In the full 80-relation condition, natural BCS variation is insufficient (IQR${}=0.033$) to yield a detectable effect ($n=25$, slope${}=+0.221$, $p \approx 0.76$). This does not invalidate the confusability effect---the within-pool slope is significant ($p=0.027$) when BCS is deliberately varied---but establishes that natural schema sampling at this scale does not produce sufficient BCS contrast for detection.

308	\end{table}
309	
310	Few-NERD is the only dataset whose prompts include type definitions; for MAVEN and FewRel, prompts use type names alone, making name-only SCS a direct match to model input. The high matrix correlation (0.66--0.89) confirms that type names capture the dominant semantic structure.
311	
312	\section{Pair-to-Batch Aggregation Simulation}
313	\label{app:aggregation-sim}
314	
315	The following simulation provides an illustrative explanatory model for how pair-level effects aggregate to batch-level variance. It is not the evidence base for our claims---the observed batch-level $R^2 = 0.218$ (\S\ref{sec:practical_magnitude}) is a direct empirical measurement independent of this simulation.
316	
317	\paragraph{Setup.} We examine whether the pair-level $R^2 \approx 7\%$ (computed over non-zero confusion pairs) can aggregate to the observed batch-level $R^2 \approx 22\%$ via a Monte Carlo simulation. From the FewRel 16-relation experiment, we estimate the inter-pair SCS correlation for pairs sharing a common type ($\rho_\text{SCS} = 0.35$). For batches of $k=8$ types ($\binom{8}{2}=28$ pairs), we simulate 10{,}000 iterations: (1) generate 28 correlated pair-level effects with individual $R^2 = 0.074$; (2) average to obtain batch-level signals; (3) compute batch-level $R^2$.
318	
319	\paragraph{Results.} Simulated batch $R^2 = 0.219$ [95\% CI: 0.092--0.361], matching the observed value of 0.218. The effective amplification factor is $\sim$3$\times$, explained by signal correlation within batches preserving variance while independent noise averages out (effective degrees of freedom $\approx 3.4$, not 28).
320	
321	\paragraph{Unconditional baseline.}
322	When the simulation uses the unconditional pairwise $r^2 = 0.013$ (computed over all type pairs including zero-confusion pairs; Table~\ref{tab:pairwise}), the simulated batch-level $R^2$ drops to $0.044$ [95\% CI: 0.001--0.151]---well below the observed $R^2 = 0.218$. The analytical formula confirms: $\text{SNR} \times \text{EF} / (\text{SNR} \times \text{EF} + 1) = 0.042$ with the same effective factor $\text{EF} = 3.35$. This ${\sim}5\times$ gap reflects the dilution from zero-confusion pairs: approximately 89\% of type pairs never exhibit mutual confusion, contributing only noise to the unconditional correlation. The conditional model ($R^2 = 0.074 \to 0.219$) matches the observed value because it isolates the minority of semantically proximate pairs that actually compete during type resolution; BCS predicts batch accuracy through the density of \emph{active} confusable pairs, not uniform contributions from all pairs.
323	
324	\section{Split-Origin Covariate Analysis}
325	\label{app:split-origin}
326	
327	FewRel combines 64 train-split and 16 val-split relation types into a single 80-type pool.  Train-origin types show numerically lower accuracy ($-8.8$\,pp, $p = 0.06$; see Limitations), raising the question of whether differential pre-training exposure confounds the BCS--accuracy relationship.  We test this by adding a per-batch \emph{train-origin ratio} (fraction of relation types drawn from the train split) as a covariate in the BCS--accuracy regression.
328	
329	\paragraph{Method.}  Across 213 multi-type batches ($k \geq 2$) from the batch-composition experiment (\S\ref{sec:sdgd}) and the factorial design (\S\ref{sec:bcs_controlled}), we compute $\texttt{train\_origin\_ratio} = n_{\text{train}} / k$ for each batch.  The ratio ranges from 0.40 to 1.00 (mean 0.80, reflecting the 64/80 base rate).  We fit:
330	\[
331	\text{accuracy} = \beta_0 + \beta_{\text{BCS}} \cdot \text{BCS} + \beta_{\text{origin}} \cdot \text{train\_origin\_ratio} + \varepsilon
332	\]
333	
334	\paragraph{Results.}  The BCS partial effect is unchanged after controlling for split-origin: $\beta_{\text{BCS}} = -0.416$, $p < 10^{-16}$ (vs.\ $\beta = -0.412$, $p < 10^{-16}$ without the covariate).  Train-origin ratio is not independently significant ($\beta_{\text{origin}} = -0.057$, $p = 0.245$), and $\Delta R^2 = 0.005$.  The BCS--accuracy relationship is therefore not confounded by differential pre-training exposure at the batch level.
335	
336	\section{Cross-Domain Connections}
337	\label{app:cross-domain}
338	
339	The schema-induced degradation documented here is not unique to information extraction. Schema-Guided Dialogue systems (SGD/SGD-X; \citealt{rastogi2020towards}) face an analogous challenge: as the number of intent and slot types grows, dialogue state tracking accuracy declines. \citet{li2023evaluating} observed count-dependent degradation in ChatGPT-based IE, attributing it to prompt overload. Our two-channel decomposition offers a more refined explanation: schema size per se is not the sole driver; rather, larger schemas increase the probability of including high-SCS pairs, which contribute disproportionately to confusion. This distinction has practical implications---a schema of 80 types with low mutual confusability may outperform a 40-type schema with clustered semantics---and suggests that confusability-aware design principles may generalize to any task where an LLM must discriminate among a prompt-specified label inventory.

388	Intra-batch variance dominates inter-seed variance by 5--474$\times$ on FewRel (mean 125$\times$, counts 4--64) and 10--99$\times$ on Few-NERD (mean 51$\times$, counts 2--44), confirming that random batch composition is the primary source of performance variability on both tasks, not seed-dependent randomness in model inference. The wide ratio range reflects variation in how tightly seed means cluster at each count level; even the minimum ratio (5.4$\times$ on FewRel at count 16, 10.2$\times$ on Few-NERD at count 2) indicates batch composition contributes the majority of observed variance. At count 80 (FewRel) and count 66 (Few-NERD), the full schema admits only one batch composition, collapsing batch variance by construction.

Greedy graph coloring (\\textsc{largest\\_first}) assigns each type to a color such that no two adjacent---i.e., highly confusable---types share a color. Each color class forms one extraction batch, and predictions are merged via set union. We compare four modes: (i)~\\textbf{single\\_pass}, the undecomposed baseline; (ii)~\\textbf{sdgd\\_zero}, SCS-guided partitioning; (iii)~\\textbf{random\\_batch}, random partitioning with matched batch sizes; and (iv)~\\textbf{per\\_type}, the extreme case where each type is extracted in isolation.\n\nSingle-pass extraction achieves F1\\,=\\,0.445 (P\\,=\\,0.563, R\\,=\\,0.368). SDGD obtains F1\\,=\\,0.251 (P\\,=\\,0.210, R\\,=\\,0.314), a 44\\% relative drop. Random batching reaches F1\\,=\\,0.320 (P\\,=\\,0.249, R\\,=\\,0.446), and per-type extraction yields F1\\,=\\,0.292 (P\\,=\\,0.194, R\\,=\\,0.586). Every decomposition mode falls below the single-pass baseline (Table~\\ref{tab:sdgd_results}).\n\n\\begin{table}[h]\n\\centering\n\\small\n\\resizebox{\\columnwidth}{!}{%\n\\begin{tabular}{lrccc}\n\\toprule\n\\textbf{Mode} & \\textbf{\\# Batches} & \\textbf{Precision} & \\textbf{Recall} & \\textbf{F1} \\\\\n\\midrule\nsingle\\_pass & 1 & 0.563 & 0.368 & 0.445 \\\\\n\\midrule\nsdgd\\_zero (v1) & 8 & 0.210 & 0.314 & 0.251 \\\\\nrandom\\_batch (v1) & 8 & 0.249 & 0.446 & 0.320 \\\\\nper\\_type & 66 & 0.194 & 0.586 & 0.292 \\\\\n\\midrule\nsdgd\\_zero (v2) & 4 & 0.324 & 0.191 & 0.241 \\\\\nrandom\\_batch (v2) & 8 & 0.331 & 0.276 & 0.301 \\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}}\n\\caption{Few-NERD extraction under decomposition modes.

When the same text is presented to the model $k$ times with different type subsets, each pass independently generates entity predictions. Because LLM outputs are not calibrated across passes, the union merge step accumulates overlapping and contradictory predictions, inflating false positives.\n\nOur v2 merge ranks competing predictions by the LLM's self-reported confidence and retains only the highest-scoring candidate for each span. Confidence gating improves precision (sdgd\\_zero: 0.210$\\to$0.324; random\\_batch: 0.249$\\to$0.331), but at the cost of disproportionate recall loss (0.314$\\to$0.191; 0.446$\\to$0.276), yielding lower F1 in both modes (sdgd\\_zero: 0.251$\\to$0.241; random\\_batch: 0.320$\\to$0.301).\n\n\\section{Factorial Analysis and Separability Test}\n\\label{sec:appendix_factorial}\n\nTo formally test whether count and confusability effects are additive, we fit a multiple regression (accuracy $\\sim$ $\\log_2$\\,count $+$ BCS $+$ count$\\times$BCS) across 69 batches from FewRel spanning five count levels ($k \\in \\{4, 8, 16, 32, 40\\}$). Both main effects are significant (count: $p = 0.008$; BCS: $p = 0.0002$; $R^2 = 0.52$), but the interaction term is negligible (0.47\\,pp). A TOST equivalence test with a $\\pm 3$\\,pp margin confirms that the interaction is bounded well below practical significance ($p_{\\text{TOST}} = 0.003$), supporting bounded interaction between count and confusability effects.\n\nA separate within-dataset $2 \\times 2$ factorial on FewRel (count $\\in \\{8, 16\\}$, BCS low/high; $n = 54$) did not reach equivalence ($p_{\\text{TOST}} = 0.56$), likely due to limited power from fewer count levels and narrower BCS contrast. The Few-NERD factorial (\\S\\ref{sec:multi_channel}) similarly did not reach significance ($p = 0.50$). The regression approach provides the stronger test by leveraging the full count range.\n\n\\paragraph{Equivalence margin justification.}\nWe set $\\pm 3$\\,pp as the smallest interaction that would materially alter practitioner decisions: a 3\\,pp interaction atop the 2.2\\,pp confusability main effect would represent ${>}130\\%$ amplification, fundamentally changing whether confusability warrants mitigation. At $\\pm 2$\\,pp (marginally equivalent, $p = 0.047$), interaction remains bounded below the main effect itself.\n\n\\begin{table}[h]\n\\centering\n\\small\n\\begin{tabular}{crrl}\n\\toprule\n\\textbf{Margin (pp)} & \\textbf{$t_{\\text{upper}}$} & \\textbf{$p_{\\text{TOST}}$} & \\textbf{Conclusion} \\\\\n\\midrule\n$\\pm 1$ & $-0.59$ & $0.278$ & Inconclusive \\\\\n$\\pm 2$ & $-1.70$ & $0.047$ & Equivalent \\\\\n$\\pm 3$ & $-2.81$ & $0.003$ & Equivalent \\\\\n$\\pm 5$ & $-5.02$ & ${<}\\,0.001$ & Equivalent \\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}\n\\caption{TOST sensitivity analysis across equivalence margins.

At $\\pm 1$\\,pp, equivalence is inconclusive ($p = 0.278$), meaning interaction could reach approximately half the main effect magnitude.}\n\\label{tab:tost_sensitivity}\n\\end{table}\n\n\\section{Within-Pool CI Details}\n\\label{sec:appendix_within_pool}\n\nThe quartile $\\Delta$ for 80-pool 16-relation subsets ($-$3.92\\,pp, 95\\% CI [$-$8.17, $+$0.38]) crosses zero, reflecting the compressed BCS range within that pool (0.46--0.68 vs.\\ 0.48--0.71 for the independent pool). Within this narrow band, the quartile contrast lacks statistical power to detect the effect that the regression identifies. The full 80-relation condition ($n = 25$) is underpowered for both the slope (CI: [$-$1.303, $+$1.695]) and quartile analyses; we include it in Table~\\ref{tab:within_pool} for completeness but do not draw inferential conclusions from it.\n\n\\section{Controlling for Centrality Confounds in MAVEN Per-Type Analysis}\n\\label{sec:appendix_residualized_bcs}\n\nSection~\\ref{sec:centrality_confound} identifies a centrality confound in MAVEN's per-type BCS--F1 correlation: both embeddings show a \\emph{positive} raw correlation, opposite to the expected direction. Here we formalize this analysis by identifying specific confounders for each embedding and testing whether the BCS--F1 relationship survives partial correlation controlling for these confounders.\n\n\\paragraph{Confound identification.}\nFor each embedding, we computed the correlation between mean BCS and candidate confounders (type frequency, degree centrality at threshold 0.7) across MAVEN's 149 active event types. The dominant confound differs by embedding:\n\\begin{itemize}[itemsep=2pt,leftmargin=*]\n\\item \\textbf{MiniLM}: BCS correlates with log type frequency ($r = 0.201$). Frequent types have more training signal and are extracted more reliably, producing the positive BCS--F1 association.\n\\item \\textbf{Qwen3}: BCS correlates strongly with degree centrality ($r = 0.854$). In the Qwen3 embedding space, high-BCS types are those with many semantic neighbors---central, well-represented types that the model extracts well.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\paragraph{Partial correlation results.}\nTable~\\ref{tab:residualized_bcs} reports raw Spearman $\\rho$ and partial Pearson $r$ after controlling for the identified confounders. Under single-variable control, both correlations weaken to non-significance. Under joint control (log frequency $+$ degree centrality simultaneously), neither embedding retains a significant BCS--F1 association.\n\n\\begin{table}[h]\n\\centering\n\\small\n\\resizebox{\\columnwidth}{!}{%\n\\begin{tabular}{llcccc}\n\\toprule\n\\textbf{Embedding} & \\textbf{Control} & \\textbf{Raw $\\rho$} & \\textbf{Raw $p$} & \\textbf{Partial $r$} & \\textbf{Partial $p$} \\\\\n\\midrule\nMiniLM & --- & $+$0.208 & $0.011$ & --- & --- \\\\\nMiniLM & log freq & --- & --- & $+$0.133 & $0.11$ \\\\\nMiniLM & log freq $+$ degree & --- & --- & --- & $0.23$ \\\\\n\\midrule\nQwen3 & --- & $+$0.184 & $0.025$ & --- & --- \\\\\nQwen3 & degree centrality & --- & --- & $+$0.063 & $0.44$ \\\\\nQwen3 & log freq $+$ degree & --- & --- & --- & $0.44$ \\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}}\n\\caption{MAVEN per-type BCS--F1 correlation before and after controlling for centrality confounders. Raw correlations are Spearman $\\rho$; partial correlations are Pearson $r$ from residualized regression. Degree centrality is computed on the SCS graph at threshold 0.7. All values from experiment \\texttt{exp\\_maven\\_residualized\\_bcs}.}\n\\label{tab:residualized_bcs}\n\\end{table}\n\n\\paragraph{Interpretation.}\nThe two embeddings encode different aspects of the same underlying confound. MiniLM, a smaller sentence encoder, produces a tighter embedding cluster for MAVEN's FrameNet-derived types; here, type frequency is the primary confounder because frequent types accumulate higher mean similarity to the dense cluster. Qwen3, with a larger representation space, differentiates types enough that frequency is not the dominant factor, but degree centrality---the count of strong semantic neighbors---becomes the confound instead. In both cases, the positive raw correlation reflects a centrality artifact: types that are semantically central are both high-BCS and easy to extract.\n\nUnder joint control, both embeddings yield $p > 0.2$, confirming that the raw positive BCS--F1 correlation on MAVEN is fully attributable to centrality-related confounders. This does not invalidate the confusability hypothesis; the pairwise SCS--confusion correlation on MAVEN remains significant (MiniLM $r = 0.129$, $p < 0.001$; Table~\\ref{tab:pairwise}). Rather, it demonstrates that per-type aggregation (mean BCS) conflates confusability with centrality in semantically homogeneous schemas, and that pairwise analysis or explicit confound adjustment is required in such settings.\n\n\\section{Batch Composition Results}\n\\label{sec:appendix_batch_composition}\n\nSee Table~\\ref{tab:batch_composition} and the accompanying discussion in \\S\\ref{sec:sdgd}.\n\n\\input{prompt_appendix}\n\n\\section{Prompt Version Sensitivity Analysis}\n\\label{sec:appendix_prompt_sensitivity}\n\nWe assess whether the confusability effects reported in \\S\\ref{sec:bcs_controlled}--\\ref{sec:multi_channel} are robust to prompt design by replicating key experiments under the v2 prompt (\\S\\ref{sec:model}; full templates in Appendix~\\ref{sec:appendix_prompts}).\n\n\\paragraph{RE (FewRel).}\nUnder the v1 prompt, the extreme-batch BCS gap (Table~\\ref{tab:bcs_controlled}) is substantial. Under v2, with $n{=}25$ batches per group and wider BCS contrast (low-BCS range [0.356, 0.367]; high-BCS range [0.791, 0.811]), the gap is $-$25.5\\,pp (low-BCS 85.2\\% vs.\\ high-BCS 59.7\\%; 95\\% CI: [22.4, 28.6]; $p < 0.001$; Pearson $r = -0.919$). The effect is significant, directionally consistent with v1, and only modestly attenuated in magnitude ($-$5.7\\,pp reduction). An earlier $n{=}5$ evaluation with narrower BCS contrast (0.21) yielded a smaller gap of $-$7.9\\,pp (CI: [$-$5.2, $+$21.5]), illustrating how limited statistical power and restricted BCS range can obscure the underlying signal---a cautionary note for small-sample prompt sensitivity studies.\n\n\\paragraph{NER (Few-NERD).}\nThe batch-level BCS--F1 correlation under v2 is consistent with v1: at count${}\\,=\\,12$, $r = +0.58$ ($p = 0.002$, 95\\% CI: [0.19, 0.81]) vs.\\ v1 $r = +0.50$ ($p = 0.008$). As discussed in \\S\\ref{sec:pairwise}, this positive direction reflects a type-frequency confound at the batch level---high-BCS batches contain high-frequency entity types that models extract more reliably---rather than evidence against the confusability hypothesis. The pairwise SCS--confusion analysis (\\S\\ref{sec:pairwise}), which is immune to this aggregation artifact, remains the primary evidence for the NER confusability channel.\n\n\\paragraph{Interpretation.}\nThe $n{=}25$ v2 result confirms that the confusability effect is directionally consistent across prompt designs, with attenuated magnitude: the gap narrows ($-$5.7\\,pp) but remains highly significant ($p < 0.001$, $r = -0.919$). The earlier $n{=}5$ non-significance reflected insufficient power and narrow BCS contrast, not absence of the effect. V2's stricter format constraints raise the baseline accuracy (low-BCS 85.2\\% vs.\\ 82.3\\%), but type confusion under high confusability persists (59.7\\% vs.\\ 51.0\\%). Prompt design modulates the practical magnitude of the confusability effect but does not eliminate it, ruling out prompt-specific confounding as the primary driver. The underlying confusability signal---pairwise SCS--confusion correlation and the directional BCS--accuracy relationship---persists across both prompt versions.\n\n\\section{BCS Aggregation Sensitivity}\n\\label{sec:appendix_bcs_sensitivity}\n\nWe define Batch Confusability Score (BCS) as the \\emph{mean} pairwise SCS across all type pairs in a batch (\\S\\ref{sec:bcs_controlled}). An alternative definition takes the \\emph{maximum} pairwise SCS within each batch, capturing the single most confusable pair. Here we compare both aggregation methods to verify that core conclusions are robust to this choice.\n\n\\begin{table}[h]\n\\centering\n\\small\n\\resizebox{\\columnwidth}{!}{%\n\\begin{tabular}{llcccc}\n\\toprule\n\\textbf{Aggregation} & \\textbf{Condition} & \\textbf{Slope} & \\textbf{95\\% CI} & \\textbf{$r$} & \\textbf{$p$} \\\\\n\\midrule\nMEAN (primary) & 16-rel & $-$0.509 & [$-$0.686, $-$0.336] & $-$0.467 & ${<}\\,0.001$ \\\\\nMEAN & 80-pool 16-sub & $-$0.401 & [$-$0.701, $-$0.069] & $-$0.221 & 0.027 \\\\\n\\midrule\nMAX & 16-rel & $-$0.449 & [$-$0.552, $-$0.346] & $-$0.637 & ${<}\\,0.001$ \\\\\nMAX & 80-pool 16-sub & $-$0.401 & [$-$0.701, $-$0.069] & $-$0.221 & 0.027 \\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}}\n\\caption{BCS--accuracy regression under mean vs.\\ max pairwise SCS aggregation (FewRel, 16-relation batches).

Both definitions produce significant negative slopes across all conditions, and the permutation tests confirm no significant difference between independent and sampled pools under either definition. We adopt MEAN as the primary definition because it better represents average pairwise difficulty across all schema combinations, while MAX may overweight a single outlier pair. The choice does not affect any paper conclusion.\n\n\\section{BCS-Controlled Detailed Results}\n\\label{app:bcs-controlled-table}\n\n\\begin{table}[h]\n\\centering\n\\small\n\\resizebox{\\columnwidth}{!}{%\n\\begin{tabular}{lcrrrr}\n\\toprule\n\\textbf{Schema} & \\textbf{Count} & \\textbf{Low-BCS} & \\textbf{High-BCS} & \\textbf{$\\Delta$ (pp)} & \\textbf{95\\% CI} \\\\\n\\midrule\n16-rel & 8 & 88.9\\% & 79.8\\% & $-$9.1 & --- \\\\\n80-rel & 8 & 82.3\\% & 51.0\\% & $-$31.2 & {[}17.7, 42.7{]} \\\\\n80-rel & 16 & 82.8\\% & 51.6\\% & $-$31.2 & {[}22.9, 39.6{]} \\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}}\n\\caption{BCS-controlled FewRel accuracy.

The smaller quartile gap ($-$3.92\\,pp vs.\\ $-$5.31\\,pp) reflects the narrower BCS range within the 80-relation pool (Appendix~\\ref{sec:appendix_within_pool}).\n\nIn the full 80-relation condition, natural BCS variation is insufficient (IQR${}=0.033$) to yield a detectable effect ($n=25$, slope${}=+0.221$, $p \\approx 0.76$). This does not invalidate the confusability effect---the within-pool slope is significant ($p=0.027$) when BCS is deliberately varied---but establishes that natural schema sampling at this scale does not produce sufficient BCS contrast for detection.\n\n\\section{SCS Embedding Ablation: Name-Only vs. Name+Definition}\n\\label{app:scs-ablation}\n\nTable~\\ref{tab:scs-ablation} compares predictive accuracy of name-only SCS against name+definition SCS across three datasets.\n\n\\begin{table}[h]\n\\centering\n\\small\n\\begin{tabular}{lcccc}\n\\toprule\nDataset & SCS$_\\text{name}$ $r$ & SCS$_\\text{def}$ $r$ & $\\Delta r$ & Matrix corr. \\\\\n\\midrule\nFew-NERD & 0.172 & 0.149 & $-$0.023 & 0.894 \\\\\nMAVEN & 0.129 & 0.164 & +0.035 & 0.656 \\\\\nFewRel & 0.178 & 0.193 & +0.015 & 0.848 \\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}\n\\caption{Pearson correlation between SCS and empirical confusion rate. ``Def'' concatenates type name with definition before embedding. All correlations significant ($p < 0.001$). The inconsistent direction of $\\Delta r$ indicates no systematic benefit from including definitions.}\n\\label{tab:scs-ablation}\n\\end{table}\n\nFew-NERD is the only dataset whose prompts include type definitions; for MAVEN and FewRel, prompts use type names alone, making name-only SCS a direct match to model input. The high matrix correlation (0.66--0.89) confirms that type names capture the dominant semantic structure.\n\n\\section{Pair-to-Batch Aggregation Simulation}\n\\label{app:aggregation-sim}\n\nThe following simulation provides an illustrative explanatory model for how pair-level effects aggregate to batch-level variance. It is not the evidence base for our claims---the observed batch-level $R^2 = 0.218$ (\\S\\ref{sec:practical_magnitude}) is a direct empirical measurement independent of this simulation.\n\n\\paragraph{Setup.} We examine whether the pair-level $R^2 \\approx 7\\%$ (computed over non-zero confusion pairs) can aggregate to the observed batch-level $R^2 \\approx 22\\%$ via a Monte Carlo simulation. From the FewRel 16-relation experiment, we estimate the inter-pair SCS correlation for pairs sharing a common type ($\\rho_\\text{SCS} = 0.35$). For batches of $k=8$ types ($\\binom{8}{2}=28$ pairs), we simulate 10{,}000 iterations: (1) generate 28 correlated pair-level effects with individual $R^2 = 0.074$; (2) average to obtain batch-level signals; (3) compute batch-level $R^2$.\n\n\\paragraph{Results.} Simulated batch $R^2 = 0.219$ [95\\% CI: 0.092--0.361], matching the observed value of 0.218. The effective amplification factor is $\\sim$3$\\times$, explained by signal correlation within batches preserving variance while independent noise averages out (effective degrees of freedom $\\approx 3.4$, not 28).\n\n\\paragraph{Unconditional baseline.}\nWhen the simulation uses the unconditional pairwise $r^2 = 0.013$ (computed over all type pairs including zero-confusion pairs; Table~\\ref{tab:pairwise}), the simulated batch-level $R^2$ drops to $0.044$ [95\\% CI: 0.001--0.151]---well below the observed $R^2 = 0.218$. The analytical formula confirms: $\\text{SNR} \\times \\text{EF} / (\\text{SNR} \\times \\text{EF} + 1) = 0.042$ with the same effective factor $\\text{EF} = 3.35$. This ${\\sim}5\\times$ gap reflects the dilution from zero-confusion pairs: approximately 89\\% of type pairs never exhibit mutual confusion, contributing only noise to the unconditional correlation. The conditional model ($R^2 = 0.074 \\to 0.219$) matches the observed value because it isolates the minority of semantically proximate pairs that actually compete during type resolution; BCS predicts batch accuracy through the density of \\emph{active} confusable pairs, not uniform contributions from all pairs.\n\n\\section{Split-Origin Covariate Analysis}\n\\label{app:split-origin}\n\nFewRel combines 64 train-split and 16 val-split relation types into a single 80-type pool.  Train-origin types show numerically lower accuracy ($-8.8$\\,pp, $p = 0.06$; see Limitations), raising the question of whether differential pre-training exposure confounds the BCS--accuracy relationship.  We test this by adding a per-batch \\emph{train-origin ratio} (fraction of relation types drawn from the train split) as a covariate in the BCS--accuracy regression.\n\n\\paragraph{Method.}  Across 213 multi-type batches ($k \\geq 2$) from the batch-composition experiment (\\S\\ref{sec:sdgd}) and the factorial design (\\S\\ref{sec:bcs_controlled}), we compute $\\texttt{train\\_origin\\_ratio} = n_{\\text{train}} / k$ for each batch.  The ratio ranges from 0.40 to 1.00 (mean 0.80, reflecting the 64/80 base rate).  We fit:\n\\[\n\\text{accuracy} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_{\\text{BCS}} \\cdot \\text{BCS} + \\beta_{\\text{origin}} \\cdot \\text{train\\_origin\\_ratio} + \\varepsilon\n\\]\n\n\\paragraph{Results.}  The BCS partial effect is unchanged after controlling for split-origin: $\\beta_{\\text{BCS}} = -0.416$, $p < 10^{-16}$ (vs.\\ $\\beta = -0.412$, $p < 10^{-16}$ without the covariate).  Train-origin ratio is not independently significant ($\\beta_{\\text{origin}} = -0.057$, $p = 0.245$), and $\\Delta R^2 = 0.005$.  The BCS--accuracy relationship is therefore not confounded by differential pre-training exposure at the batch level.\n\n\\section{Cross-Domain Connections}\n\\label{app:cross-domain}\n\nThe schema-induced degradation documented here is not unique to information extraction. Schema-Guided Dialogue systems (SGD/SGD-X; \\citealt{rastogi2020towards}) face an analogous challenge: as the number of intent and slot types grows, dialogue state tracking accuracy declines. \\citet{li2023evaluating} observed count-dependent degradation in ChatGPT-based IE, attributing it to prompt overload. Our two-channel decomposition offers a more refined explanation: schema size per se is not the sole driver; rather, larger schemas increase the probability of including high-SCS pairs, which contribute disproportionately to confusion. This distinction has practical implications---a schema of 80 types with low mutual confusability may outperform a 40-type schema with clustered semantics---and suggests that confusability-aware design principles may generalize to any task where an LLM must discriminate among a prompt-specified label inventory.\n\n\\section{Additional Experimental Details}\n\\label{sec:appendix_additional_details}\n\n\\subsection{Cross-Seed Variance Decomposition}\n\\label{app:variance-decomposition}\n\nTo quantify whether performance variability is driven by random batch composition or seed-dependent model inference noise, we decompose total variance into intra-seed (batch) and inter-seed components across three seeds (42, 123, 456), each evaluated on 25 random batches per count level.\n\n\\begin{table}[h]\n\\centering\n\\small\n\\begin{tabular}{rrrr}\n\\toprule\n\\textbf{Count} & \\textbf{Batch SD} & \\textbf{Seed SD} & \\textbf{Ratio} \\\\\n\\midrule\n4 & 0.0889 & 0.0122 & 53.5 \\\\\n8 & 0.0820 & 0.0098 & 70.0 \\\\\n16 & 0.0626 & 0.0270 & 5.4 \\\\\n32 & 0.0462 & 0.0091 & 26.0 \\\\\n40 & 0.0421 & 0.0019 & 474.4 \\\\\n64 & 0.0245 & 0.0022 & 119.8 \\\\\n80 & 0.0001 & 0.0088 & $<$0.1 \\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}\n\\caption{Variance decomposition across count levels on FewRel.

### Assistant

_source line 14_

Now I have a clear picture of all four files. Let me make the edits.

**Key observations:**
- `sdgd_negative.tex`: The routing paragraph should go after line 23 (the "Oracle routing" paragraph), before the table at line 25.
- `supplementary.tex`: The routing table should go in the SDGD appendix section (after line 116, before the Factorial section).
- `introduction.tex`: Contribution 4 is at line 19.
- `abstract.tex`: Mentions "oracle routing recovers substantial RE gains, but confusability-aware grouping yields no significant improvement over random" — this is already compatible with the new evidence, no change needed.

Let me make the edits now.

    "originalFile": "\\section{Schema Decomposition: Failure, Diagnosis, and Mitigation}\n\\label{sec:sdgd}\n\nA natural intervention against confusability-driven degradation is to partition the schema so that confusable types never co-occur in the same prompt. We test this idea with \\textbf{Schema-DAG-Guided Decomposition} (SDGD\\footnote{SDGD (Schema Decomposition and Grouping for Degradation mitigation) is an adopted abbreviation for schema decomposition and grouping; the graph structure is undirected.}), which uses greedy graph coloring on the pairwise SCS graph to assign types to low-confusability batches.\n\nWe construct a thresholded confusability graph $G = (V, E)$ where each type is a vertex and an edge connects types $t_i, t_j$ whenever $\\text{SCS}(t_i, t_j) > \\tau$. Greedy graph coloring (\\textsc{largest\\_first}) assigns each type to a color such that no two adjacent---i.e., highly confusable---types share a batch. Each color class forms one extraction batch. For NER, predictions from all batches are merged via set union; for RE, each instance is routed to the batch containing its gold type (oracle routing). We test four NER modes: (i)~\\textbf{single\\_pass}, the undecomposed baseline; (ii)~\\textbf{sdgd\\_zero}, SCS-guided partitioning; (iii)~\\textbf{random\\_batch}, random partitioning with matched batch sizes; and (iv)~\\textbf{per\\_type}, each type extracted in isolation. Every mode falls below the single-pass NER baseline: SDGD obtains F1\\,=\\,0.251, random batching 0.320, per-type 0.292, versus 0.445 for single-pass (Table~\\ref{tab:sdgd_results}, Appendix~\\ref{sec:appendix_sdgd}).\n\n\\paragraph{Merge amplification in NER.}\nThe core failure mechanism is \\emph{merge amplification}: presenting the same text to the model $k$ times with different type subsets causes each pass to independently generate entity predictions, and union merge accumulates all of them into a single output. Each pass produces an independent set of span predictions; because LLM outputs are not calibrated across passes \\cite{llm-calibration-survey-2024}, the same span may receive conflicting type labels from different passes, or hallucinated entities may appear in passes where the correct type is absent. Union merge retains all predictions, so false positives scale with $k$ while true positives are bounded by the fixed set of gold entities.\n\nQuantitatively, single-pass precision (0.563) collapses to 0.210--0.249 after union merge across 8 batches, while recall gains are modest (0.368 $\\to$ 0.314 for sdgd\\_zero, 0.446 for random batch). The net F1 loss is substantial: 0.445 $\\to$ 0.251 (sdgd\\_zero) or 0.320 (random batch). Per-type extraction (66 batches) pushes recall to 0.586 but precision to 0.194 (F1\\,=\\,0.292), confirming that the precision--recall imbalance intensifies with the number of passes. Random batching outperforms confusability-aware SDGD on NER (0.320 vs.\\ 0.251) because the dominant degradation source---merge amplification---is independent of batch composition; any multi-pass scheme suffers from it regardless of grouping quality.\n\n\\paragraph{Confidence gating does not resolve merge amplification.}\nConfidence-based gating (retaining only predictions above threshold) trades recall for precision but does not recover net F1 (0.251$\\to$0.241), confirming that merge artifacts are systemic rather than confined to low-confidence predictions (Appendix~\\ref{sec:appendix_sdgd}).\n\n\\paragraph{Why NER fails but RE does not.}\nMerge amplification is specific to span-level tasks. Each NER pass independently proposes entity spans, and union merge must resolve conflicting boundaries and type assignments, degrading systematically with pass count. RE avoids this mechanism entirely: under oracle routing, each relation instance receives a single classification from the batch containing its gold type, requiring no span reconciliation and eliminating the multi-pass interference that causes SDGD to fail on NER. This makes RE a clean testbed for evaluating whether confusability-aware decomposition improves accuracy once merge artifacts are removed.\n\n\\enlargethispage*{9\\baselineskip}\n\\paragraph{Oracle routing as performance ceiling.}\nOracle routing routes each test instance to the batch containing its gold type, eliminating cross-type confusion within each batch. On FewRel 80-relation RE, oracle-routed decomposition achieves 0.802 accuracy versus 0.504 for the single-pass baseline---a gain of +29.8\\,pp (Table~\\ref{tab:batch_composition}). This is the strongest positive finding of the decomposition experiments: it demonstrates that type confusability is indeed a key driver of degradation in RE, and that performance recovers substantially when confusable types are separated.\n\nHowever, oracle routing requires gold labels and is not deployable. The gap between the oracle ceiling and practical routing reveals an important asymmetry: while \\emph{any} decomposition benefits enormously from removing the 80-type bottleneck (+28.4\\,pp for random batching, +29.8\\,pp for graph coloring), the \\emph{additional} benefit of confusability-aware grouping over random grouping is modest (+1.4\\,pp, $p \\approx 0.19$). The confusability-aware strategy ranks 13th out of 15 random seeds, limited by the narrow BCS margin (0.006) between graph-coloring and random batches at this partition granularity.

The confusability-aware strategy ranks 13th out of 15 random seeds, limited by the narrow BCS margin (0.006) between graph-coloring and random batches at this partition granularity. Finer-grained partitioning or alternative confusability metrics may be needed to translate the oracle-demonstrated potential into significant practical gains.",

          "+We evaluate five non-oracle routing strategies on the same FewRel 80-relation task: max-confidence (all predictions), max-confidence (positive only), none-aware selection, margin-based routing, and random assignment. All five perform below the single-pass baseline (50.4\\%), with the best practical strategy reaching only 36.5\\% accuracy (Table~\\ref{tab:routing_strategies}, Appendix~\\ref{sec:appendix_routing}). The root cause is constrained decoding: the enum constraint forces the model to produce a confident type prediction for every sub-schema, even when the correct type is absent from the candidate set. As a result, 73.4\\% of instances receive positive predictions from 3--5 sub-schemas simultaneously, and the none-rate per sub-schema is only 20--40\\%. Confidence signals become unreliable when every sub-schema produces high-confidence outputs, rendering all confidence-based routing ineffective. The oracle gain (+22.0\\,pp over single-pass) therefore depends on a routing signal that constrained decoding systematically destroys. Free-form generation or calibrated confidence estimation may provide more reliable routing signals for future work.",

    "originalFile": "\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{sec:introduction}\n\nTraining-free\\footnote{We use ``training-free'' and ``zero-shot'' interchangeably to denote prompting without parameter updates.}\\footnote{Code and data will be released upon acceptance. Anonymous review materials: \\url{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/schema-dag-extraction}} LLM information extraction---prompting a large language model with a target schema and asking it to extract structured information without any task-specific fine-tuning---enables rapid deployment across new domains and ontologies. This zero-shot paradigm eliminates the need for labeled data, making it attractive for applications where annotation is expensive or schemas evolve frequently \\cite{llm4ie-survey-2024}. Yet the paradigm carries a critical limitation: performance degrades sharply as the number of candidate types in the prompt schema grows. On named entity recognition, recall drops from 0.72 with a single candidate type to a plateau of ${\\sim}$0.27 across intermediate schema sizes (22--44 types) before partial recovery at full-schema. On relation extraction, accuracy falls from 85.7\\% with one relation to 49.5\\% with 80 relations (sentence-level) and from 88.0\\% to 38.7\\% with 96 relations (document-level)---near or exceeding halving. This degradation is not academic: real-world ontologies routinely define 50--200+ types, placing them squarely in the regime where training-free extraction becomes unreliable.\n\nWhat explains this degradation? Prior decomposition strategies \\cite{uniner-2024,llm-pee-2025,parse-2025} conflate two mechanisms: having more types to discriminate among (count) and having semantically similar types to confuse (confusability) (hereafter Channel~1 and Channel~2). None isolates which factor predicts the gains (\\S\\ref{sec:related_work}).\n\nWe ask three questions. \\textbf{RQ1}: Does type confusability independently predict extraction degradation beyond the effect of type count? \\textbf{RQ2}: Through what mechanisms do count and confusability each degrade performance? \\textbf{RQ3}: Can confusability-aware schema decomposition improve extraction quality?\n\nTo our knowledge, we present the first controlled study isolating type confusability from type count via stratified design in zero-shot LLM IE, spanning NER, RE, and event detection (ED). We operationalize confusability via the \\emph{Schema Confusability Score} (SCS)---pairwise embedding cosine similarity---and its batch-level aggregation, the \\emph{Batch Confusability Score} (BCS). We evaluate on Few-NERD \\cite{fewnerd-2021}, FewRel \\cite{fewrel-2018}, DocRED \\cite{docred-2019}, and MAVEN \\cite{maven-2020} using Qwen3-32B (\\S\\ref{sec:experimental_setup}).\n\nOur experiments yield five findings: (1)~degradation operates through two channels---count-driven recall decline (up to $-$49\\,pp at intermediate schema sizes for document-level RE) and confusability-driven type substitution (typical-batch gap ${\\approx}\\,2.2$\\,pp; quartile $\\Delta = -5.3$\\,pp)---an asymmetric relationship where count dominates, consistent with bounded interaction in RE (TOST $p = 0.003$ at $\\pm 3$\\,pp) but coupled in NER where NER recall exhibits non-monotonic recovery at full-schema; (2)~pairwise SCS predicts type confusion ($r = 0.112$--$0.129$), the first factor empirically isolated in controlled zero-shot IE; (3)~effects are consistent across schema sizes and granularities (BCS slopes: $p = 0.60$; DocRED: slope $= -0.71$, $R^2 = 0.53$), and directionally consistent across prompt designs, with attenuated magnitude under improved prompts; (4)~per-type aggregation is confounded by centrality on homogeneous schemas; (5)~NER decomposition fails due to merge amplification; RE confusability-aware grouping yields no significant improvement over random (+1.4\\,pp, $p \\approx 0.19$, n.s.) despite oracle routing recovering +29.8\\,pp.\n\nOur contributions are:\n\\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*,itemsep=2pt,topsep=2pt]\n    \\item \\textbf{Count dominates confusability by ${\\sim}20\\times$ in typical batches.} Through stratified design isolating count from confusability, we show count effects ($-$42\\% to $-$56\\% recall) dwarf typical confusability effects (2.2\\,pp), counter to decomposition literature's implicit assumption that confusability is the primary bottleneck.

Greedy graph coloring (\\textsc{largest\\_first}) assigns each type to a color such that no two adjacent---i.e., highly confusable---types share a color. Each color class forms one extraction batch, and predictions are merged via set union. We compare four modes: (i)~\\textbf{single\\_pass}, the undecomposed baseline; (ii)~\\textbf{sdgd\\_zero}, SCS-guided partitioning; (iii)~\\textbf{random\\_batch}, random partitioning with matched batch sizes; and (iv)~\\textbf{per\\_type}, the extreme case where each type is extracted in isolation.\n\nSingle-pass extraction achieves F1\\,=\\,0.445 (P\\,=\\,0.563, R\\,=\\,0.368). SDGD obtains F1\\,=\\,0.251 (P\\,=\\,0.210, R\\,=\\,0.314), a 44\\% relative drop.

When the same text is presented to the model $k$ times with different type subsets, each pass independently generates entity predictions. Because LLM outputs are not calibrated across passes, the union merge step accumulates overlapping and contradictory predictions, inflating false positives.\n\nOur v2 merge ranks competing predictions by the LLM's self-reported confidence and retains only the highest-scoring candidate for each span. Confidence gating improves precision (sdgd\\_zero: 0.210$\\to$0.324; random\\_batch: 0.249$\\to$0.331), but at the cost of disproportionate recall loss (0.314$\\to$0.191; 0.446$\\to$0.276), yielding lower F1 in both modes (sdgd\\_zero: 0.251$\\to$0.241; random\\_batch: 0.320$\\to$0.301).\n\n\\section{Factorial Analysis and Separability Test}\n\\label{sec:appendix_factorial}\n\nTo formally test whether count and confusability effects are additive, we fit a multiple regression (accuracy $\\sim$ $\\log_2$\\,count $+$ BCS $+$ count$\\times$BCS) across 69 batches from FewRel spanning five count levels ($k \\in \\{4, 8, 16, 32, 40\\}$). Both main effects are significant (count: $p = 0.008$; BCS: $p = 0.0002$; $R^2 = 0.52$), but the interaction term is negligible (0.47\\,pp). A TOST equivalence test with a $\\pm 3$\\,pp margin confirms that the interaction is bounded well below practical significance ($p_{\\text{TOST}} = 0.003$), supporting bounded interaction between count and confusability effects.\n\nA separate within-dataset $2 \\times 2$ factorial on FewRel (count $\\in \\{8, 16\\}$, BCS low/high; $n = 54$) did not reach equivalence ($p_{\\text{TOST}} = 0.56$), likely due to limited power from fewer count levels and narrower BCS contrast. The Few-NERD factorial (\\S\\ref{sec:multi_channel}) similarly did not reach significance ($p = 0.50$). The regression approach provides the stronger test by leveraging the full count range.\n\n\\paragraph{Equivalence margin justification.}\nWe set $\\pm 3$\\,pp as the smallest interaction that would materially alter practitioner decisions: a 3\\,pp interaction atop the 2.2\\,pp confusability main effect would represent ${>}130\\%$ amplification, fundamentally changing whether confusability warrants mitigation. At $\\pm 2$\\,pp (marginally equivalent, $p = 0.047$), interaction remains bounded below the main effect itself.\n\n\\begin{table}[h]\n\\centering\n\\small\n\\begin{tabular}{crrl}\n\\toprule\n\\textbf{Margin (pp)} & \\textbf{$t_{\\text{upper}}$} & \\textbf{$p_{\\text{TOST}}$} & \\textbf{Conclusion} \\\\\n\\midrule\n$\\pm 1$ & $-0.59$ & $0.278$ & Inconclusive \\\\\n$\\pm 2$ & $-1.70$ & $0.047$ & Equivalent \\\\\n$\\pm 3$ & $-2.81$ & $0.003$ & Equivalent \\\\\n$\\pm 5$ & $-5.02$ & ${<}\\,0.001$ & Equivalent \\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}\n\\caption{TOST sensitivity analysis across equivalence margins.

Within this narrow band, the quartile contrast lacks statistical power to detect the effect that the regression identifies. The full 80-relation condition ($n = 25$) is underpowered for both the slope (CI: [$-$1.303, $+$1.695]) and quartile analyses; we include it in Table~\\ref{tab:within_pool} for completeness but do not draw inferential conclusions from it.\n\n\\section{Controlling for Centrality Confounds in MAVEN Per-Type Analysis}\n\\label{sec:appendix_residualized_bcs}\n\nSection~\\ref{sec:centrality_confound} identifies a centrality confound in MAVEN's per-type BCS--F1 correlation: both embeddings show a \\emph{positive} raw correlation, opposite to the expected direction. Here we formalize this analysis by identifying specific confounders for each embedding and testing whether the BCS--F1 relationship survives partial correlation controlling for these confounders.\n\n\\paragraph{Confound identification.}\nFor each embedding, we computed the correlation between mean BCS and candidate confounders (type frequency, degree centrality at threshold 0.7) across MAVEN's 149 active event types. The dominant confound differs by embedding:\n\\begin{itemize}[itemsep=2pt,leftmargin=*]\n\\item \\textbf{MiniLM}: BCS correlates with log type frequency ($r = 0.201$). Frequent types have more training signal and are extracted more reliably, producing the positive BCS--F1 association.\n\\item \\textbf{Qwen3}: BCS correlates strongly with degree centrality ($r = 0.854$). In the Qwen3 embedding space, high-BCS types are those with many semantic neighbors---central, well-represented types that the model extracts well.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\paragraph{Partial correlation results.}\nTable~\\ref{tab:residualized_bcs} reports raw Spearman $\\rho$ and partial Pearson $r$ after controlling for the identified confounders. Under single-variable control, both correlations weaken to non-significance. Under joint control (log frequency $+$ degree centrality simultaneously), neither embedding retains a significant BCS--F1 association.\n\n\\begin{table}[h]\n\\centering\n\\small\n\\resizebox{\\columnwidth}{!}{%\n\\begin{tabular}{llcccc}\n\\toprule\n\\textbf{Embedding} & \\textbf{Control} & \\textbf{Raw $\\rho$} & \\textbf{Raw $p$} & \\textbf{Partial $r$} & \\textbf{Partial $p$} \\\\\n\\midrule\nMiniLM & --- & $+$0.208 & $0.011$ & --- & --- \\\\\nMiniLM & log freq & --- & --- & $+$0.133 & $0.11$ \\\\\nMiniLM & log freq $+$ degree & --- & --- & --- & $0.23$ \\\\\n\\midrule\nQwen3 & --- & $+$0.184 & $0.025$ & --- & --- \\\\\nQwen3 & degree centrality & --- & --- & $+$0.063 & $0.44$ \\\\\nQwen3 & log freq $+$ degree & --- & --- & --- & $0.44$ \\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}}\n\\caption{MAVEN per-type BCS--F1 correlation before and after controlling for centrality confounders.

MiniLM, a smaller sentence encoder, produces a tighter embedding cluster for MAVEN's FrameNet-derived types; here, type frequency is the primary confounder because frequent types accumulate higher mean similarity to the dense cluster. Qwen3, with a larger representation space, differentiates types enough that frequency is not the dominant factor, but degree centrality---the count of strong semantic neighbors---becomes the confound instead. In both cases, the positive raw correlation reflects a centrality artifact: types that are semantically central are both high-BCS and easy to extract.\n\nUnder joint control, both embeddings yield $p > 0.2$, confirming that the raw positive BCS--F1 correlation on MAVEN is fully attributable to centrality-related confounders. This does not invalidate the confusability hypothesis; the pairwise SCS--confusion correlation on MAVEN remains significant (MiniLM $r = 0.129$, $p < 0.001$; Table~\\ref{tab:pairwise}). Rather, it demonstrates that per-type aggregation (mean BCS) conflates confusability with centrality in semantically homogeneous schemas, and that pairwise analysis or explicit confound adjustment is required in such settings.\n\n\\section{Batch Composition Results}\n\\label{sec:appendix_batch_composition}\n\nSee Table~\\ref{tab:batch_composition} and the accompanying discussion in \\S\\ref{sec:sdgd}.\n\n\\input{prompt_appendix}\n\n\\section{Prompt Version Sensitivity Analysis}\n\\label{sec:appendix_prompt_sensitivity}\n\nWe assess whether the confusability effects reported in \\S\\ref{sec:bcs_controlled}--\\ref{sec:multi_channel} are robust to prompt design by replicating key experiments under the v2 prompt (\\S\\ref{sec:model}; full templates in Appendix~\\ref{sec:appendix_prompts}).\n\n\\paragraph{RE (FewRel).}\nUnder the v1 prompt, the extreme-batch BCS gap (Table~\\ref{tab:bcs_controlled}) is substantial. Under v2, with $n{=}25$ batches per group and wider BCS contrast (low-BCS range [0.356, 0.367]; high-BCS range [0.791, 0.811]), the gap is $-$25.5\\,pp (low-BCS 85.2\\% vs.\\ high-BCS 59.7\\%; 95\\% CI: [22.4, 28.6]; $p < 0.001$; Pearson $r = -0.919$). The effect is significant, directionally consistent with v1, and only modestly attenuated in magnitude ($-$5.7\\,pp reduction). An earlier $n{=}5$ evaluation with narrower BCS contrast (0.21) yielded a smaller gap of $-$7.9\\,pp (CI: [$-$5.2, $+$21.5]), illustrating how limited statistical power and restricted BCS range can obscure the underlying signal---a cautionary note for small-sample prompt sensitivity studies.\n\n\\paragraph{NER (Few-NERD).}\nThe batch-level BCS--F1 correlation under v2 is consistent with v1: at count${}\\,=\\,12$, $r = +0.58$ ($p = 0.002$, 95\\% CI: [0.19, 0.81]) vs.\\ v1 $r = +0.50$ ($p = 0.008$). As discussed in \\S\\ref{sec:pairwise}, this positive direction reflects a type-frequency confound at the batch level---high-BCS batches contain high-frequency entity types that models extract more reliably---rather than evidence against the confusability hypothesis. The pairwise SCS--confusion analysis (\\S\\ref{sec:pairwise}), which is immune to this aggregation artifact, remains the primary evidence for the NER confusability channel.\n\n\\paragraph{Interpretation.}\nThe $n{=}25$ v2 result confirms that the confusability effect is directionally consistent across prompt designs, with attenuated magnitude: the gap narrows ($-$5.7\\,pp) but remains highly significant ($p < 0.001$, $r = -0.919$). The earlier $n{=}5$ non-significance reflected insufficient power and narrow BCS contrast, not absence of the effect. V2's stricter format constraints raise the baseline accuracy (low-BCS 85.2\\% vs.\\ 82.3\\%), but type confusion under high confusability persists (59.7\\% vs.\\ 51.0\\%). Prompt design modulates the practical magnitude of the confusability effect but does not eliminate it, ruling out prompt-specific confounding as the primary driver. The underlying confusability signal---pairwise SCS--confusion correlation and the directional BCS--accuracy relationship---persists across both prompt versions.\n\n\\section{BCS Aggregation Sensitivity}\n\\label{sec:appendix_bcs_sensitivity}\n\nWe define Batch Confusability Score (BCS) as the \\emph{mean} pairwise SCS across all type pairs in a batch (\\S\\ref{sec:bcs_controlled}). An alternative definition takes the \\emph{maximum} pairwise SCS within each batch, capturing the single most confusable pair. Here we compare both aggregation methods to verify that core conclusions are robust to this choice.\n\n\\begin{table}[h]\n\\centering\n\\small\n\\resizebox{\\columnwidth}{!}{%\n\\begin{tabular}{llcccc}\n\\toprule\n\\textbf{Aggregation} & \\textbf{Condition} & \\textbf{Slope} & \\textbf{95\\% CI} & \\textbf{$r$} & \\textbf{$p$} \\\\\n\\midrule\nMEAN (primary) & 16-rel & $-$0.509 & [$-$0.686, $-$0.336] & $-$0.467 & ${<}\\,0.001$ \\\\\nMEAN & 80-pool 16-sub & $-$0.401 & [$-$0.701, $-$0.069] & $-$0.221 & 0.027 \\\\\n\\midrule\nMAX & 16-rel & $-$0.449 & [$-$0.552, $-$0.346] & $-$0.637 & ${<}\\,0.001$ \\\\\nMAX & 80-pool 16-sub & $-$0.401 & [$-$0.701, $-$0.069] & $-$0.221 & 0.027 \\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}}\n\\caption{BCS--accuracy regression under mean vs.\\ max pairwise SCS aggregation (FewRel, 16-relation batches).

Both definitions produce significant negative slopes across all conditions, and the permutation tests confirm no significant difference between independent and sampled pools under either definition. We adopt MEAN as the primary definition because it better represents average pairwise difficulty across all schema combinations, while MAX may overweight a single outlier pair. The choice does not affect any paper conclusion.\n\n\\section{BCS-Controlled Detailed Results}\n\\label{app:bcs-controlled-table}\n\n\\begin{table}[h]\n\\centering\n\\small\n\\resizebox{\\columnwidth}{!}{%\n\\begin{tabular}{lcrrrr}\n\\toprule\n\\textbf{Schema} & \\textbf{Count} & \\textbf{Low-BCS} & \\textbf{High-BCS} & \\textbf{$\\Delta$ (pp)} & \\textbf{95\\% CI} \\\\\n\\midrule\n16-rel & 8 & 88.9\\% & 79.8\\% & $-$9.1 & --- \\\\\n80-rel & 8 & 82.3\\% & 51.0\\% & $-$31.2 & {[}17.7, 42.7{]} \\\\\n80-rel & 16 & 82.8\\% & 51.6\\% & $-$31.2 & {[}22.9, 39.6{]} \\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}}\n\\caption{BCS-controlled FewRel accuracy.

This does not invalidate the confusability effect---the within-pool slope is significant ($p=0.027$) when BCS is deliberately varied---but establishes that natural schema sampling at this scale does not produce sufficient BCS contrast for detection.\n\n\\section{SCS Embedding Ablation: Name-Only vs. Name+Definition}\n\\label{app:scs-ablation}\n\nTable~\\ref{tab:scs-ablation} compares predictive accuracy of name-only SCS against name+definition SCS across three datasets.\n\n\\begin{table}[h]\n\\centering\n\\small\n\\begin{tabular}{lcccc}\n\\toprule\nDataset & SCS$_\\text{name}$ $r$ & SCS$_\\text{def}$ $r$ & $\\Delta r$ & Matrix corr. \\\\\n\\midrule\nFew-NERD & 0.172 & 0.149 & $-$0.023 & 0.894 \\\\\nMAVEN & 0.129 & 0.164 & +0.035 & 0.656 \\\\\nFewRel & 0.178 & 0.193 & +0.015 & 0.848 \\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}\n\\caption{Pearson correlation between SCS and empirical confusion rate. ``Def'' concatenates type name with definition before embedding.

The high matrix correlation (0.66--0.89) confirms that type names capture the dominant semantic structure.\n\n\\section{Pair-to-Batch Aggregation Simulation}\n\\label{app:aggregation-sim}\n\nThe following simulation provides an illustrative explanatory model for how pair-level effects aggregate to batch-level variance. It is not the evidence base for our claims---the observed batch-level $R^2 = 0.218$ (\\S\\ref{sec:practical_magnitude}) is a direct empirical measurement independent of this simulation.\n\n\\paragraph{Setup.} We examine whether the pair-level $R^2 \\approx 7\\%$ (computed over non-zero confusion pairs) can aggregate to the observed batch-level $R^2 \\approx 22\\%$ via a Monte Carlo simulation. From the FewRel 16-relation experiment, we estimate the inter-pair SCS correlation for pairs sharing a common type ($\\rho_\\text{SCS} = 0.35$). For batches of $k=8$ types ($\\binom{8}{2}=28$ pairs), we simulate 10{,}000 iterations: (1) generate 28 correlated pair-level effects with individual $R^2 = 0.074$; (2) average to obtain batch-level signals; (3) compute batch-level $R^2$.\n\n\\paragraph{Results.} Simulated batch $R^2 = 0.219$ [95\\% CI: 0.092--0.361], matching the observed value of 0.218. The effective amplification factor is $\\sim$3$\\times$, explained by signal correlation within batches preserving variance while independent noise averages out (effective degrees of freedom $\\approx 3.4$, not 28).\n\n\\paragraph{Unconditional baseline.}\nWhen the simulation uses the unconditional pairwise $r^2 = 0.013$ (computed over all type pairs including zero-confusion pairs; Table~\\ref{tab:pairwise}), the simulated batch-level $R^2$ drops to $0.044$ [95\\% CI: 0.001--0.151]---well below the observed $R^2 = 0.218$. The analytical formula confirms: $\\text{SNR} \\times \\text{EF} / (\\text{SNR} \\times \\text{EF} + 1) = 0.042$ with the same effective factor $\\text{EF} = 3.35$. This ${\\sim}5\\times$ gap reflects the dilution from zero-confusion pairs: approximately 89\\% of type pairs never exhibit mutual confusion, contributing only noise to the unconditional correlation. The conditional model ($R^2 = 0.074 \\to 0.219$) matches the observed value because it isolates the minority of semantically proximate pairs that actually compete during type resolution; BCS predicts batch accuracy through the density of \\emph{active} confusable pairs, not uniform contributions from all pairs.\n\n\\section{Split-Origin Covariate Analysis}\n\\label{app:split-origin}\n\nFewRel combines 64 train-split and 16 val-split relation types into a single 80-type pool.  Train-origin types show numerically lower accuracy ($-8.8$\\,pp, $p = 0.06$; see Limitations), raising the question of whether differential pre-training exposure confounds the BCS--accuracy relationship.  We test this by adding a per-batch \\emph{train-origin ratio} (fraction of relation types drawn from the train split) as a covariate in the BCS--accuracy regression.\n\n\\paragraph{Method.}  Across 213 multi-type batches ($k \\geq 2$) from the batch-composition experiment (\\S\\ref{sec:sdgd}) and the factorial design (\\S\\ref{sec:bcs_controlled}), we compute $\\texttt{train\\_origin\\_ratio} = n_{\\text{train}} / k$ for each batch.  The ratio ranges from 0.40 to 1.00 (mean 0.80, reflecting the 64/80 base rate).  We fit:\n\\[\n\\text{accuracy} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_{\\text{BCS}} \\cdot \\text{BCS} + \\beta_{\\text{origin}} \\cdot \\text{train\\_origin\\_ratio} + \\varepsilon\n\\]\n\n\\paragraph{Results.}  The BCS partial effect is unchanged after controlling for split-origin: $\\beta_{\\text{BCS}} = -0.416$, $p < 10^{-16}$ (vs.\\ $\\beta = -0.412$, $p < 10^{-16}$ without the covariate).  Train-origin ratio is not independently significant ($\\beta_{\\text{origin}} = -0.057$, $p = 0.245$), and $\\Delta R^2 = 0.005$.  The BCS--accuracy relationship is therefore not confounded by differential pre-training exposure at the batch level.\n\n\\section{Cross-Domain Connections}\n\\label{app:cross-domain}\n\nThe schema-induced degradation documented here is not unique to information extraction. Schema-Guided Dialogue systems (SGD/SGD-X; \\citealt{rastogi2020towards}) face an analogous challenge: as the number of intent and slot types grows, dialogue state tracking accuracy declines. \\citet{li2023evaluating} observed count-dependent degradation in ChatGPT-based IE, attributing it to prompt overload. Our two-channel decomposition offers a more refined explanation: schema size per se is not the sole driver; rather, larger schemas increase the probability of including high-SCS pairs, which contribute disproportionately to confusion. This distinction has practical implications---a schema of 80 types with low mutual confusability may outperform a 40-type schema with clustered semantics---and suggests that confusability-aware design principles may generalize to any task where an LLM must discriminate among a prompt-specified label inventory.\n\n\\section{Additional Experimental Details}\n\\label{sec:appendix_additional_details}\n\n\\subsection{Cross-Seed Variance Decomposition}\n\\label{app:variance-decomposition}\n\nTo quantify whether performance variability is driven by random batch composition or seed-dependent model inference noise, we decompose total variance into intra-seed (batch) and inter-seed components across three seeds (42, 123, 456), each evaluated on 25 random batches per count level.\n\n\\begin{table}[h]\n\\centering\n\\small\n\\begin{tabular}{rrrr}\n\\toprule\n\\textbf{Count} & \\textbf{Batch SD} & \\textbf{Seed SD} & \\textbf{Ratio} \\\\\n\\midrule\n4 & 0.0889 & 0.0122 & 53.5 \\\\\n8 & 0.0820 & 0.0098 & 70.0 \\\\\n16 & 0.0626 & 0.0270 & 5.4 \\\\\n32 & 0.0462 & 0.0091 & 26.0 \\\\\n40 & 0.0421 & 0.0019 & 474.4 \\\\\n64 & 0.0245 & 0.0022 & 119.8 \\\\\n80 & 0.0001 & 0.0088 & $<$0.1 \\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}\n\\caption{Variance decomposition across count levels on FewRel.

The wide ratio range reflects variation in how tightly seed means cluster at each count level; even the minimum ratio (5.4$\\times$ on FewRel at count 16, 10.2$\\times$ on Few-NERD at count 2) indicates batch composition contributes the majority of observed variance.

All three edits done. Abstract doesn't need changes — it already says "oracle routing recovers substantial RE gains, but confusability-aware grouping yields no significant improvement over random," which is compatible with the new evidence.

Now let me compile to verify.

38	\section*{Limitations}
39	\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*,itemsep=2pt]
40	\item \textbf{Model coverage.} Primary experiments use Qwen3-32B with cross-model validation on Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct. Whether patterns hold for proprietary models (GPT-4, Gemini) remains unverified. Channel~2 was not robustly detectable on NER at 8B scale, likely due to floor effects.
41	
42	\item \textbf{Modest pairwise effect size.} Pairwise SCS explains 1.3--1.7\% of type confusion variance; entity frequency, prompt position, mention ambiguity, and type definition quality likely account for the remainder.
43	
44	\item \textbf{Factorial interaction tests.} Within-dataset count $\times$ BCS interaction on Few-NERD did not reach significance ($p = 0.50$; Appendix~\ref{sec:appendix_factorial}). However, a FewRel factorial with TOST equivalence testing confirms bounded interaction ($p_{\text{TOST}} = 0.003$ at $\pm 3$\,pp, interaction = 0.47\,pp; Appendix~\ref{sec:appendix_factorial}), and cross-pool slope consistency ($p = 0.60$) corroborates stable rather than amplifying sensitivity.
45	
46	\item \textbf{Decomposition and metric scope.} RE batch composition is tested on FewRel only; NER merge alternatives remain unexplored. SCS relies on embedding cosine similarity; label entropy or ontological depth may capture complementary dimensions. For Few-NERD, SCS is computed from the extraction model's own embeddings (Qwen3), creating a shared-representation dependency. MiniLM cross-check yields a conservative but directionally consistent estimate ($r = 0.172$ vs $r = 0.138$; confusion matrix correlation 0.894), suggesting the effect is not an artifact of shared representations.
47	
48	\item \textbf{NER evaluation metric.} Our exact-match NER evaluation conflates boundary errors (partial span overlap) with type errors (correct span, wrong label). Relaxed matching may yield different confusability effect sizes, as boundary ambiguity may correlate with schema complexity independently of type similarity.
49	
50	\item \textbf{RE format specificity.} RE's clean channel separation may reflect its closed-set classification format. FewRel combines training and validation splits for 80 types and characterizes classification accuracy rather than end-to-end extraction.
51	
52	\item \textbf{Causal mechanism.} The study establishes correlational evidence with controlled stratification; mechanistic analysis at the attention or logit level is needed to confirm the causal pathway. The controlled stratification provides evidence consistent with a directional relationship but does not establish interventional causality.
53	
54	\item \textbf{Data contamination.} FewRel (2018) may appear in pretraining corpora. However, train-origin relations show numerically lower accuracy than val-origin ($-8.8$\,pp, $p=0.06$, n.s.), opposite to the contamination hypothesis. Moreover, the monotonic count-dependent degradation curve (85.7\%$\to$50.4\%) cannot be explained by uniform contamination, which would elevate all conditions equally. BCS slope consistency across independent and within-pool conditions (permutation $p = 0.60$) provides a robustness check that is difficult to reconcile with non-uniform contamination, which would differentially affect specific type subsets. DocRED (2019) provides a lower-contamination-risk replication with consistent BCS--accuracy slopes ($R^2 = 0.53$). Adding train-origin ratio as a covariate leaves the BCS partial effect unchanged ($p = 0.245$ for origin; Appendix~\ref{app:split-origin}).
55	\end{enumerate}
56	
57	\paragraph{Multiple comparisons.} Following the argument that independent replications do not require family-wise correction \citep{rothman-1990}, while acknowledging the opposing view \citep{perneger-1998}, we treat each dataset as a separate test of the same hypothesis. Within-dataset secondary analyses are reported with individual $p$-values; core claims rest on effects reaching $p < 0.001$.

### Assistant

_source line 29_

The appendix is embedded in `main.tex` directly, not in `supplementary.tex`. The supplementary.tex is a standalone document. The references in `sdgd_negative.tex` point to `\ref{tab:routing_strategies}` and `\ref{sec:appendix_routing}`, but the table and label are in `supplementary.tex` which is compiled separately.

I need to add the routing table and label to `main.tex`'s appendix section instead. Let me find where the SDGD appendix is in main.tex.

123	
124	\section{SDGD Full Protocol and Results}
125	\label{sec:appendix_sdgd}
126	
127	We construct a thresholded confusability graph $G = (V, E)$ where each type is a vertex and an edge connects types $t_i, t_j$ whenever $\text{SCS}(t_i, t_j) > \tau$. Greedy graph coloring (\textsc{largest\_first}) assigns each type to a color such that no two adjacent---i.e., highly confusable---types share a color. Each color class forms one extraction batch, and predictions are merged via set union. We compare four modes: (i)~\textbf{single\_pass}, the undecomposed baseline; (ii)~\textbf{sdgd\_zero}, SCS-guided partitioning; (iii)~\textbf{random\_batch}, random partitioning with matched batch sizes; and (iv)~\textbf{per\_type}, the extreme case where each type is extracted in isolation.
128	
129	Single-pass extraction achieves F1\,=\,0.445 (P\,=\,0.563, R\,=\,0.368). SDGD obtains F1\,=\,0.251 (P\,=\,0.210, R\,=\,0.314), a 44\% relative drop. Random batching reaches F1\,=\,0.320 (P\,=\,0.249, R\,=\,0.446), and per-type extraction yields F1\,=\,0.292 (P\,=\,0.194, R\,=\,0.586). Every decomposition mode falls below the single-pass baseline (Table~\ref{tab:sdgd_results}).
130

134	\resizebox{\columnwidth}{!}{%

150	\label{tab:sdgd_results}
151	\end{table}
152	
153	Decomposition boosts recall (per-type recall reaches 0.586 versus single-pass 0.368) but devastates precision (0.194 versus 0.563). When the same text is presented to the model $k$ times with different type subsets, each pass independently generates entity predictions. Because LLM outputs are not calibrated across passes, the union merge step accumulates overlapping and contradictory predictions, inflating false positives.
154	
155	Our v2 merge ranks competing predictions by the LLM's self-reported confidence and retains only the highest-scoring candidate for each span. Confidence gating improves precision (sdgd\_zero: 0.210$\to$0.324; random\_batch: 0.249$\to$0.331), but at the cost of disproportionate recall loss (0.314$\to$0.191; 0.446$\to$0.276), yielding lower F1 in both modes (sdgd\_zero: 0.251$\to$0.241; random\_batch: 0.320$\to$0.301).
156	
157	\section{Factorial Analysis and Separability Test}
158	\label{sec:appendix_factorial}
159	
160	To formally test whether count and confusability effects are additive, we fit a multiple regression (accuracy $\sim$ $\log_2$\,count $+$ BCS $+$ count$\times$BCS) across 69 batches from FewRel spanning five count levels ($k \in \{4, 8, 16, 32, 40\}$). Both main effects are significant (count: $p = 0.008$; BCS: $p = 0.0002$; $R^2 = 0.52$), but the interaction term is negligible (0.47\,pp). A TOST equivalence test with a $\pm 3$\,pp margin confirms that the interaction is bounded well below practical significance ($p_{\text{TOST}} = 0.003$), supporting bounded interaction between count and confusability effects.
161	
162	A separate within-dataset $2 \times 2$ factorial on FewRel (count $\in \{8, 16\}$, BCS low/high; $n = 54$) did not reach equivalence ($p_{\text{TOST}} = 0.56$), likely due to limited power from fewer count levels and narrower BCS contrast. The Few-NERD factorial (\S\ref{sec:multi_channel}) similarly did not reach significance ($p = 0.50$). The regression approach provides the stronger test by leveraging the full count range.
163	
164	\paragraph{Equivalence margin justification.}
165	We set $\pm 3$\,pp as the smallest interaction that would materially alter practitioner decisions: a 3\,pp interaction atop the 2.2\,pp confusability main effect would represent ${>}130\%$ amplification, fundamentally changing whether confusability warrants mitigation. At $\pm 2$\,pp (marginally equivalent, $p = 0.047$), interaction remains bounded below the main effect itself.
166	
167	\begin{table}[h]
168	\centering
169	\small
170	\begin{tabular}{crrl}
171	\toprule
172	\textbf{Margin (pp)} & \textbf{$t_{\text{upper}}$} & \textbf{$p_{\text{TOST}}$} & \textbf{Conclusion} \\
173	\midrule
174	$\pm 1$ & $-0.59$ & $0.278$ & Inconclusive \\
175	$\pm 2$ & $-1.70$ & $0.047$ & Equivalent \\
176	$\pm 3$ & $-2.81$ & $0.003$ & Equivalent \\

179	\end{tabular}
180	\caption{TOST sensitivity analysis across equivalence margins. The interaction effect (0.47\,pp, 90\% CI [$-$1.0, 2.0]\,pp) is bounded below 2\,pp at marginal significance ($p = 0.047$), confirming that the $\pm 3$\,pp choice does not drive the equivalence conclusion. At $\pm 1$\,pp, equivalence is inconclusive ($p = 0.278$), meaning interaction could reach approximately half the main effect magnitude.}
181	\label{tab:tost_sensitivity}
182	\end{table}
183	
184	\section{Within-Pool CI Details}
185	\label{sec:appendix_within_pool}
186	
187	The quartile $\Delta$ for 80-pool 16-relation subsets ($-$3.92\,pp, 95\% CI [$-$8.17, $+$0.38]) crosses zero, reflecting the compressed BCS range within that pool (0.46--0.68 vs.\ 0.48--0.71 for the independent pool). Within this narrow band, the quartile contrast lacks statistical power to detect the effect that the regression identifies. The full 80-relation condition ($n = 25$) is underpowered for both the slope (CI: [$-$1.303, $+$1.695]) and quartile analyses; we include it in Table~\ref{tab:within_pool} for completeness but do not draw inferential conclusions from it.
188	
189	\section{Controlling for Centrality Confounds in MAVEN Per-Type Analysis}
190	\label{sec:appendix_residualized_bcs}
191	
192	Section~\ref{sec:centrality_confound} identifies a centrality confound in MAVEN's per-type BCS--F1 correlation: both embeddings show a \emph{positive} raw correlation, opposite to the expected direction. Here we formalize this analysis by identifying specific confounders for each embedding and testing whether the BCS--F1 relationship survives partial correlation controlling for these confounders.
193	
194	\paragraph{Confound identification.}
195	For each embedding, we computed the correlation between mean BCS and candidate confounders (type frequency, degree centrality at threshold 0.7) across MAVEN's 149 active event types. The dominant confound differs by embedding:
196	\begin{itemize}[itemsep=2pt,leftmargin=*]
197	\item \textbf{MiniLM}: BCS correlates with log type frequency ($r = 0.201$). Frequent types have more training signal and are extracted more reliably, producing the positive BCS--F1 association.
198	\item \textbf{Qwen3}: BCS correlates strongly with degree centrality ($r = 0.854$). In the Qwen3 embedding space, high-BCS types are those with many semantic neighbors---central, well-represented types that the model extracts well.
199	\end{itemize}

Greedy graph coloring (\\textsc{largest\\_first}) assigns each type to a color such that no two adjacent---i.e., highly confusable---types share a color. Each color class forms one extraction batch, and predictions are merged via set union. We compare four modes: (i)~\\textbf{single\\_pass}, the undecomposed baseline; (ii)~\\textbf{sdgd\\_zero}, SCS-guided partitioning; (iii)~\\textbf{random\\_batch}, random partitioning with matched batch sizes; and (iv)~\\textbf{per\\_type}, the extreme case where each type is extracted in isolation.\n\nSingle-pass extraction achieves F1\\,=\\,0.445 (P\\,=\\,0.563, R\\,=\\,0.368). SDGD obtains F1\\,=\\,0.251 (P\\,=\\,0.210, R\\,=\\,0.314), a 44\\% relative drop. Random batching reaches F1\\,=\\,0.320 (P\\,=\\,0.249, R\\,=\\,0.446), and per-type extraction yields F1\\,=\\,0.292 (P\\,=\\,0.194, R\\,=\\,0.586). Every decomposition mode falls below the single-pass baseline (Table~\\ref{tab:sdgd_results}).\n\n\\begin{table}[h]\n\\centering\n\\small\n\\resizebox{\\columnwidth}{!}{%\n\\begin{tabular}{lrccc}\n\\toprule\n\\textbf{Mode} & \\textbf{\\# Batches} & \\textbf{Precision} & \\textbf{Recall} & \\textbf{F1} \\\\\n\\midrule\nsingle\\_pass & 1 & 0.563 & 0.368 & 0.445 \\\\\n\\midrule\nsdgd\\_zero (v1) & 8 & 0.210 & 0.314 & 0.251 \\\\\nrandom\\_batch (v1) & 8 & 0.249 & 0.446 & 0.320 \\\\\nper\\_type & 66 & 0.194 & 0.586 & 0.292 \\\\\n\\midrule\nsdgd\\_zero (v2) & 4 & 0.324 & 0.191 & 0.241 \\\\\nrandom\\_batch (v2) & 8 & 0.331 & 0.276 & 0.301 \\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}}\n\\caption{Few-NERD extraction under decomposition modes.

When the same text is presented to the model $k$ times with different type subsets, each pass independently generates entity predictions. Because LLM outputs are not calibrated across passes, the union merge step accumulates overlapping and contradictory predictions, inflating false positives.\n\nOur v2 merge ranks competing predictions by the LLM's self-reported confidence and retains only the highest-scoring candidate for each span. Confidence gating improves precision (sdgd\\_zero: 0.210$\\to$0.324; random\\_batch: 0.249$\\to$0.331), but at the cost of disproportionate recall loss (0.314$\\to$0.191; 0.446$\\to$0.276), yielding lower F1 in both modes (sdgd\\_zero: 0.251$\\to$0.241; random\\_batch: 0.320$\\to$0.301).\n\n\\section{Factorial Analysis and Separability Test}\n\\label{sec:appendix_factorial}\n\nTo formally test whether count and confusability effects are additive, we fit a multiple regression (accuracy $\\sim$ $\\log_2$\\,count $+$ BCS $+$ count$\\times$BCS) across 69 batches from FewRel spanning five count levels ($k \\in \\{4, 8, 16, 32, 40\\}$). Both main effects are significant (count: $p = 0.008$; BCS: $p = 0.0002$; $R^2 = 0.52$), but the interaction term is negligible (0.47\\,pp). A TOST equivalence test with a $\\pm 3$\\,pp margin confirms that the interaction is bounded well below practical significance ($p_{\\text{TOST}} = 0.003$), supporting bounded interaction between count and confusability effects.\n\nA separate within-dataset $2 \\times 2$ factorial on FewRel (count $\\in \\{8, 16\\}$, BCS low/high; $n = 54$) did not reach equivalence ($p_{\\text{TOST}} = 0.56$), likely due to limited power from fewer count levels and narrower BCS contrast. The Few-NERD factorial (\\S\\ref{sec:multi_channel}) similarly did not reach significance ($p = 0.50$). The regression approach provides the stronger test by leveraging the full count range.\n\n\\paragraph{Equivalence margin justification.}\nWe set $\\pm 3$\\,pp as the smallest interaction that would materially alter practitioner decisions: a 3\\,pp interaction atop the 2.2\\,pp confusability main effect would represent ${>}130\\%$ amplification, fundamentally changing whether confusability warrants mitigation. At $\\pm 2$\\,pp (marginally equivalent, $p = 0.047$), interaction remains bounded below the main effect itself.\n\n\\begin{table}[h]\n\\centering\n\\small\n\\begin{tabular}{crrl}\n\\toprule\n\\textbf{Margin (pp)} & \\textbf{$t_{\\text{upper}}$} & \\textbf{$p_{\\text{TOST}}$} & \\textbf{Conclusion} \\\\\n\\midrule\n$\\pm 1$ & $-0.59$ & $0.278$ & Inconclusive \\\\\n$\\pm 2$ & $-1.70$ & $0.047$ & Equivalent \\\\\n$\\pm 3$ & $-2.81$ & $0.003$ & Equivalent \\\\\n$\\pm 5$ & $-5.02$ & ${<}\\,0.001$ & Equivalent \\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}\n\\caption{TOST sensitivity analysis across equivalence margins.

At $\\pm 1$\\,pp, equivalence is inconclusive ($p = 0.278$), meaning interaction could reach approximately half the main effect magnitude.}\n\\label{tab:tost_sensitivity}\n\\end{table}\n\n\\section{Within-Pool CI Details}\n\\label{sec:appendix_within_pool}\n\nThe quartile $\\Delta$ for 80-pool 16-relation subsets ($-$3.92\\,pp, 95\\% CI [$-$8.17, $+$0.38]) crosses zero, reflecting the compressed BCS range within that pool (0.46--0.68 vs.\\ 0.48--0.71 for the independent pool). Within this narrow band, the quartile contrast lacks statistical power to detect the effect that the regression identifies. The full 80-relation condition ($n = 25$) is underpowered for both the slope (CI: [$-$1.303, $+$1.695]) and quartile analyses; we include it in Table~\\ref{tab:within_pool} for completeness but do not draw inferential conclusions from it.\n\n\\section{Controlling for Centrality Confounds in MAVEN Per-Type Analysis}\n\\label{sec:appendix_residualized_bcs}\n\nSection~\\ref{sec:centrality_confound} identifies a centrality confound in MAVEN's per-type BCS--F1 correlation: both embeddings show a \\emph{positive} raw correlation, opposite to the expected direction. Here we formalize this analysis by identifying specific confounders for each embedding and testing whether the BCS--F1 relationship survives partial correlation controlling for these confounders.\n\n\\paragraph{Confound identification.}\nFor each embedding, we computed the correlation between mean BCS and candidate confounders (type frequency, degree centrality at threshold 0.7) across MAVEN's 149 active event types. The dominant confound differs by embedding:\n\\begin{itemize}[itemsep=2pt,leftmargin=*]\n\\item \\textbf{MiniLM}: BCS correlates with log type frequency ($r = 0.201$). Frequent types have more training signal and are extracted more reliably, producing the positive BCS--F1 association.\n\\item \\textbf{Qwen3}: BCS correlates strongly with degree centrality ($r = 0.854$). In the Qwen3 embedding space, high-BCS types are those with many semantic neighbors---central, well-represented types that the model extracts well.\n\\end{itemize}",

Whether patterns hold for proprietary models (GPT-4, Gemini) remains unverified. Channel~2 was not robustly detectable on NER at 8B scale, likely due to floor effects.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Modest pairwise effect size.} Pairwise SCS explains 1.3--1.7\\% of type confusion variance; entity frequency, prompt position, mention ambiguity, and type definition quality likely account for the remainder.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Factorial interaction tests.} Within-dataset count $\\times$ BCS interaction on Few-NERD did not reach significance ($p = 0.50$; Appendix~\\ref{sec:appendix_factorial}). However, a FewRel factorial with TOST equivalence testing confirms bounded interaction ($p_{\\text{TOST}} = 0.003$ at $\\pm 3$\\,pp, interaction = 0.47\\,pp; Appendix~\\ref{sec:appendix_factorial}), and cross-pool slope consistency ($p = 0.60$) corroborates stable rather than amplifying sensitivity.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Decomposition and metric scope.} RE batch composition is tested on FewRel only; NER merge alternatives remain unexplored. SCS relies on embedding cosine similarity; label entropy or ontological depth may capture complementary dimensions. For Few-NERD, SCS is computed from the extraction model's own embeddings (Qwen3), creating a shared-representation dependency. MiniLM cross-check yields a conservative but directionally consistent estimate ($r = 0.172$ vs $r = 0.138$; confusion matrix correlation 0.894), suggesting the effect is not an artifact of shared representations.\n\n\\item \\textbf{NER evaluation metric.} Our exact-match NER evaluation conflates boundary errors (partial span overlap) with type errors (correct span, wrong label). Relaxed matching may yield different confusability effect sizes, as boundary ambiguity may correlate with schema complexity independently of type similarity.\n\n\\item \\textbf{RE format specificity.} RE's clean channel separation may reflect its closed-set classification format. FewRel combines training and validation splits for 80 types and characterizes classification accuracy rather than end-to-end extraction.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Causal mechanism.} The study establishes correlational evidence with controlled stratification; mechanistic analysis at the attention or logit level is needed to confirm the causal pathway. The controlled stratification provides evidence consistent with a directional relationship but does not establish interventional causality.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Data contamination.} FewRel (2018) may appear in pretraining corpora. However, train-origin relations show numerically lower accuracy than val-origin ($-8.8$\\,pp, $p=0.06$, n.s.), opposite to the contamination hypothesis. Moreover, the monotonic count-dependent degradation curve (85.7\\%$\\to$50.4\\%) cannot be explained by uniform contamination, which would elevate all conditions equally. BCS slope consistency across independent and within-pool conditions (permutation $p = 0.60$) provides a robustness check that is difficult to reconcile with non-uniform contamination, which would differentially affect specific type subsets. DocRED (2019) provides a lower-contamination-risk replication with consistent BCS--accuracy slopes ($R^2 = 0.53$). Adding train-origin ratio as a covariate leaves the BCS partial effect unchanged ($p = 0.245$ for origin; Appendix~\\ref{app:split-origin}).\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\paragraph{Multiple comparisons.} Following the argument that independent replications do not require family-wise correction \\citep{rothman-1990}, while acknowledging the opposing view \\citep{perneger-1998}, we treat each dataset as a separate test of the same hypothesis. Within-dataset secondary analyses are reported with individual $p$-values; core claims rest on effects reaching $p < 0.001$.\n\n\\input{checklist}\n\n\\bibliography{references}\n\n\\appendix\n\n\\section{Additional Figures}\n\\label{sec:appendix_figures}\n\n\\begin{table}[h]\n\\centering\n\\small\n\\begin{tabular}{lrr}\n\\toprule\n\\textbf{Count} & \\textbf{Llama-3.1-8B} & \\textbf{Qwen3-32B} \\\\\n\\midrule\n1 & 0.702 & 0.640 \\\\\n64 & 0.273 & 0.304 \\\\\n\\midrule\nDecline & $-$43\\,pp & $-$34\\,pp \\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}\n\\caption{Cross-model count-curve replication on Few-NERD (text-match recall).

Greedy graph coloring (\\textsc{largest\\_first}) assigns each type to a color such that no two adjacent---i.e., highly confusable---types share a color. Each color class forms one extraction batch, and predictions are merged via set union. We compare four modes: (i)~\\textbf{single\\_pass}, the undecomposed baseline; (ii)~\\textbf{sdgd\\_zero}, SCS-guided partitioning; (iii)~\\textbf{random\\_batch}, random partitioning with matched batch sizes; and (iv)~\\textbf{per\\_type}, the extreme case where each type is extracted in isolation.\n\nSingle-pass extraction achieves F1\\,=\\,0.445 (P\\,=\\,0.563, R\\,=\\,0.368). SDGD obtains F1\\,=\\,0.251 (P\\,=\\,0.210, R\\,=\\,0.314), a 44\\% relative drop.

When the same text is presented to the model $k$ times with different type subsets, each pass independently generates entity predictions. Because LLM outputs are not calibrated across passes, the union merge step accumulates overlapping and contradictory predictions, inflating false positives.\n\nOur v2 merge ranks competing predictions by the LLM's self-reported confidence and retains only the highest-scoring candidate for each span. Confidence gating improves precision (sdgd\\_zero: 0.210$\\to$0.324; random\\_batch: 0.249$\\to$0.331), but at the cost of disproportionate recall loss (0.314$\\to$0.191; 0.446$\\to$0.276), yielding lower F1 in both modes (sdgd\\_zero: 0.251$\\to$0.241; random\\_batch: 0.320$\\to$0.301).\n\n\\section{Factorial Analysis and Separability Test}\n\\label{sec:appendix_factorial}\n\nTo formally test whether count and confusability effects are additive, we fit a multiple regression (accuracy $\\sim$ $\\log_2$\\,count $+$ BCS $+$ count$\\times$BCS) across 69 batches from FewRel spanning five count levels ($k \\in \\{4, 8, 16, 32, 40\\}$). Both main effects are significant (count: $p = 0.008$; BCS: $p = 0.0002$; $R^2 = 0.52$), but the interaction term is negligible (0.47\\,pp). A TOST equivalence test with a $\\pm 3$\\,pp margin confirms that the interaction is bounded well below practical significance ($p_{\\text{TOST}} = 0.003$), supporting bounded interaction between count and confusability effects.\n\nA separate within-dataset $2 \\times 2$ factorial on FewRel (count $\\in \\{8, 16\\}$, BCS low/high; $n = 54$) did not reach equivalence ($p_{\\text{TOST}} = 0.56$), likely due to limited power from fewer count levels and narrower BCS contrast. The Few-NERD factorial (\\S\\ref{sec:multi_channel}) similarly did not reach significance ($p = 0.50$). The regression approach provides the stronger test by leveraging the full count range.\n\n\\paragraph{Equivalence margin justification.}\nWe set $\\pm 3$\\,pp as the smallest interaction that would materially alter practitioner decisions: a 3\\,pp interaction atop the 2.2\\,pp confusability main effect would represent ${>}130\\%$ amplification, fundamentally changing whether confusability warrants mitigation. At $\\pm 2$\\,pp (marginally equivalent, $p = 0.047$), interaction remains bounded below the main effect itself.\n\n\\begin{table}[h]\n\\centering\n\\small\n\\begin{tabular}{crrl}\n\\toprule\n\\textbf{Margin (pp)} & \\textbf{$t_{\\text{upper}}$} & \\textbf{$p_{\\text{TOST}}$} & \\textbf{Conclusion} \\\\\n\\midrule\n$\\pm 1$ & $-0.59$ & $0.278$ & Inconclusive \\\\\n$\\pm 2$ & $-1.70$ & $0.047$ & Equivalent \\\\\n$\\pm 3$ & $-2.81$ & $0.003$ & Equivalent \\\\\n$\\pm 5$ & $-5.02$ & ${<}\\,0.001$ & Equivalent \\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}\n\\caption{TOST sensitivity analysis across equivalence margins.

Within this narrow band, the quartile contrast lacks statistical power to detect the effect that the regression identifies. The full 80-relation condition ($n = 25$) is underpowered for both the slope (CI: [$-$1.303, $+$1.695]) and quartile analyses; we include it in Table~\\ref{tab:within_pool} for completeness but do not draw inferential conclusions from it.\n\n\\section{Controlling for Centrality Confounds in MAVEN Per-Type Analysis}\n\\label{sec:appendix_residualized_bcs}\n\nSection~\\ref{sec:centrality_confound} identifies a centrality confound in MAVEN's per-type BCS--F1 correlation: both embeddings show a \\emph{positive} raw correlation, opposite to the expected direction. Here we formalize this analysis by identifying specific confounders for each embedding and testing whether the BCS--F1 relationship survives partial correlation controlling for these confounders.\n\n\\paragraph{Confound identification.}\nFor each embedding, we computed the correlation between mean BCS and candidate confounders (type frequency, degree centrality at threshold 0.7) across MAVEN's 149 active event types. The dominant confound differs by embedding:\n\\begin{itemize}[itemsep=2pt,leftmargin=*]\n\\item \\textbf{MiniLM}: BCS correlates with log type frequency ($r = 0.201$). Frequent types have more training signal and are extracted more reliably, producing the positive BCS--F1 association.\n\\item \\textbf{Qwen3}: BCS correlates strongly with degree centrality ($r = 0.854$). In the Qwen3 embedding space, high-BCS types are those with many semantic neighbors---central, well-represented types that the model extracts well.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\paragraph{Partial correlation results.}\nTable~\\ref{tab:residualized_bcs} reports raw Spearman $\\rho$ and partial Pearson $r$ after controlling for the identified confounders. Under single-variable control, both correlations weaken to non-significance. Under joint control (log frequency $+$ degree centrality simultaneously), neither embedding retains a significant BCS--F1 association.\n\n\\begin{table}[h]\n\\centering\n\\small\n\\resizebox{\\columnwidth}{!}{%\n\\begin{tabular}{llcccc}\n\\toprule\n\\textbf{Embedding} & \\textbf{Control} & \\textbf{Raw $\\rho$} & \\textbf{Raw $p$} & \\textbf{Partial $r$} & \\textbf{Partial $p$} \\\\\n\\midrule\nMiniLM & --- & $+$0.208 & $0.011$ & --- & --- \\\\\nMiniLM & log freq & --- & --- & $+$0.133 & $0.11$ \\\\\nMiniLM & log freq $+$ degree & --- & --- & --- & $0.23$ \\\\\n\\midrule\nQwen3 & --- & $+$0.184 & $0.025$ & --- & --- \\\\\nQwen3 & degree centrality & --- & --- & $+$0.063 & $0.44$ \\\\\nQwen3 & log freq $+$ degree & --- & --- & --- & $0.44$ \\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}}\n\\caption{MAVEN per-type BCS--F1 correlation before and after controlling for centrality confounders.

MiniLM, a smaller sentence encoder, produces a tighter embedding cluster for MAVEN's FrameNet-derived types; here, type frequency is the primary confounder because frequent types accumulate higher mean similarity to the dense cluster. Qwen3, with a larger representation space, differentiates types enough that frequency is not the dominant factor, but degree centrality---the count of strong semantic neighbors---becomes the confound instead. In both cases, the positive raw correlation reflects a centrality artifact: types that are semantically central are both high-BCS and easy to extract.\n\nUnder joint control, both embeddings yield $p > 0.2$, confirming that the raw positive BCS--F1 correlation on MAVEN is fully attributable to centrality-related confounders. This does not invalidate the confusability hypothesis; the pairwise SCS--confusion correlation on MAVEN remains significant (MiniLM $r = 0.129$, $p < 0.001$; Table~\\ref{tab:pairwise}). Rather, it demonstrates that per-type aggregation (mean BCS) conflates confusability with centrality in semantically homogeneous schemas, and that pairwise analysis or explicit confound adjustment is required in such settings.\n\n\\section{Batch Composition Results}\n\\label{sec:appendix_batch_composition}\n\nSee Table~\\ref{tab:batch_composition} and the accompanying discussion in \\S\\ref{sec:sdgd}.\n\n\\input{prompt_appendix}\n\n\\section{Prompt Version Sensitivity Analysis}\n\\label{sec:appendix_prompt_sensitivity}\n\nWe assess whether the confusability effects reported in \\S\\ref{sec:bcs_controlled}--\\ref{sec:multi_channel} are robust to prompt design by replicating key experiments under the v2 prompt (\\S\\ref{sec:model}; full templates in Appendix~\\ref{sec:appendix_prompts}).\n\n\\paragraph{RE (FewRel).}\nUnder the v1 prompt, the extreme-batch BCS gap (Table~\\ref{tab:bcs_controlled}) is substantial. Under v2, with $n{=}25$ batches per group and wider BCS contrast (low-BCS range [0.356, 0.367]; high-BCS range [0.791, 0.811]), the gap is $-$25.5\\,pp (low-BCS 85.2\\% vs.\\ high-BCS 59.7\\%; 95\\% CI: [22.4, 28.6]; $p < 0.001$; Pearson $r = -0.919$). The effect is significant, directionally consistent with v1, and only modestly attenuated in magnitude ($-$5.7\\,pp reduction). An earlier $n{=}5$ evaluation with narrower BCS contrast (0.21) yielded a smaller gap of $-$7.9\\,pp (CI: [$-$5.2, $+$21.5]), illustrating how limited statistical power and restricted BCS range can obscure the underlying signal---a cautionary note for small-sample prompt sensitivity studies.\n\n\\paragraph{NER (Few-NERD).}\nThe batch-level BCS--F1 correlation under v2 is consistent with v1: at count${}\\,=\\,12$, $r = +0.58$ ($p = 0.002$, 95\\% CI: [0.19, 0.81]) vs.\\ v1 $r = +0.50$ ($p = 0.008$). As discussed in \\S\\ref{sec:pairwise}, this positive direction reflects a type-frequency confound at the batch level---high-BCS batches contain high-frequency entity types that models extract more reliably---rather than evidence against the confusability hypothesis. The pairwise SCS--confusion analysis (\\S\\ref{sec:pairwise}), which is immune to this aggregation artifact, remains the primary evidence for the NER confusability channel.\n\n\\paragraph{Interpretation.}\nThe $n{=}25$ v2 result confirms that the confusability effect is directionally consistent across prompt designs, with attenuated magnitude: the gap narrows ($-$5.7\\,pp) but remains highly significant ($p < 0.001$, $r = -0.919$). The earlier $n{=}5$ non-significance reflected insufficient power and narrow BCS contrast, not absence of the effect. V2's stricter format constraints raise the baseline accuracy (low-BCS 85.2\\% vs.\\ 82.3\\%), but type confusion under high confusability persists (59.7\\% vs.\\ 51.0\\%). Prompt design modulates the practical magnitude of the confusability effect but does not eliminate it, ruling out prompt-specific confounding as the primary driver. The underlying confusability signal---pairwise SCS--confusion correlation and the directional BCS--accuracy relationship---persists across both prompt versions.\n\n\\section{BCS Aggregation Sensitivity}\n\\label{sec:appendix_bcs_sensitivity}\n\nWe define Batch Confusability Score (BCS) as the \\emph{mean} pairwise SCS across all type pairs in a batch (\\S\\ref{sec:bcs_controlled}). An alternative definition takes the \\emph{maximum} pairwise SCS within each batch, capturing the single most confusable pair. Here we compare both aggregation methods to verify that core conclusions are robust to this choice.\n\n\\begin{table}[h]\n\\centering\n\\small\n\\resizebox{\\columnwidth}{!}{%\n\\begin{tabular}{llcccc}\n\\toprule\n\\textbf{Aggregation} & \\textbf{Condition} & \\textbf{Slope} & \\textbf{95\\% CI} & \\textbf{$r$} & \\textbf{$p$} \\\\\n\\midrule\nMEAN (primary) & 16-rel & $-$0.509 & [$-$0.686, $-$0.336] & $-$0.467 & ${<}\\,0.001$ \\\\\nMEAN & 80-pool 16-sub & $-$0.401 & [$-$0.701, $-$0.069] & $-$0.221 & 0.027 \\\\\n\\midrule\nMAX & 16-rel & $-$0.449 & [$-$0.552, $-$0.346] & $-$0.637 & ${<}\\,0.001$ \\\\\nMAX & 80-pool 16-sub & $-$0.401 & [$-$0.701, $-$0.069] & $-$0.221 & 0.027 \\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}}\n\\caption{BCS--accuracy regression under mean vs.\\ max pairwise SCS aggregation (FewRel, 16-relation batches).

Both definitions produce significant negative slopes across all conditions, and the permutation tests confirm no significant difference between independent and sampled pools under either definition. We adopt MEAN as the primary definition because it better represents average pairwise difficulty across all schema combinations, while MAX may overweight a single outlier pair. The choice does not affect any paper conclusion.\n\n\\section{BCS-Controlled Detailed Results}\n\\label{app:bcs-controlled-table}\n\n\\begin{table}[h]\n\\centering\n\\small\n\\resizebox{\\columnwidth}{!}{%\n\\begin{tabular}{lcrrrr}\n\\toprule\n\\textbf{Schema} & \\textbf{Count} & \\textbf{Low-BCS} & \\textbf{High-BCS} & \\textbf{$\\Delta$ (pp)} & \\textbf{95\\% CI} \\\\\n\\midrule\n16-rel & 8 & 88.9\\% & 79.8\\% & $-$9.1 & --- \\\\\n80-rel & 8 & 82.3\\% & 51.0\\% & $-$31.2 & {[}17.7, 42.7{]} \\\\\n80-rel & 16 & 82.8\\% & 51.6\\% & $-$31.2 & {[}22.9, 39.6{]} \\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}}\n\\caption{BCS-controlled FewRel accuracy.

This does not invalidate the confusability effect---the within-pool slope is significant ($p=0.027$) when BCS is deliberately varied---but establishes that natural schema sampling at this scale does not produce sufficient BCS contrast for detection.\n\n\\section{SCS Embedding Ablation: Name-Only vs. Name+Definition}\n\\label{app:scs-ablation}\n\nTable~\\ref{tab:scs-ablation} compares predictive accuracy of name-only SCS against name+definition SCS across three datasets.\n\n\\begin{table}[h]\n\\centering\n\\small\n\\begin{tabular}{lcccc}\n\\toprule\nDataset & SCS$_\\text{name}$ $r$ & SCS$_\\text{def}$ $r$ & $\\Delta r$ & Matrix corr. \\\\\n\\midrule\nFew-NERD & 0.172 & 0.149 & $-$0.023 & 0.894 \\\\\nMAVEN & 0.129 & 0.164 & +0.035 & 0.656 \\\\\nFewRel & 0.178 & 0.193 & +0.015 & 0.848 \\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}\n\\caption{Pearson correlation between SCS and empirical confusion rate. ``Def'' concatenates type name with definition before embedding.

The high matrix correlation (0.66--0.89) confirms that type names capture the dominant semantic structure.\n\n\\section{Pair-to-Batch Aggregation Simulation}\n\\label{app:aggregation-sim}\n\nThe following simulation provides an illustrative explanatory model for how pair-level effects aggregate to batch-level variance. It is not the evidence base for our claims---the observed batch-level $R^2 = 0.218$ (\\S\\ref{sec:practical_magnitude}) is a direct empirical measurement independent of this simulation.\n\n\\paragraph{Setup.} We examine whether the pair-level $R^2 \\approx 7\\%$ (computed over non-zero confusion pairs) can aggregate to the observed batch-level $R^2 \\approx 22\\%$ via a Monte Carlo simulation. From the FewRel 16-relation experiment, we estimate the inter-pair SCS correlation for pairs sharing a common type ($\\rho_\\text{SCS} = 0.35$). For batches of $k=8$ types ($\\binom{8}{2}=28$ pairs), we simulate 10{,}000 iterations: (1) generate 28 correlated pair-level effects with individual $R^2 = 0.074$; (2) average to obtain batch-level signals; (3) compute batch-level $R^2$.\n\n\\paragraph{Results.} Simulated batch $R^2 = 0.219$ [95\\% CI: 0.092--0.361], matching the observed value of 0.218. The effective amplification factor is $\\sim$3$\\times$, explained by signal correlation within batches preserving variance while independent noise averages out (effective degrees of freedom $\\approx 3.4$, not 28).\n\n\\paragraph{Unconditional baseline.}\nWhen the simulation uses the unconditional pairwise $r^2 = 0.013$ (computed over all type pairs including zero-confusion pairs; Table~\\ref{tab:pairwise}), the simulated batch-level $R^2$ drops to $0.044$ [95\\% CI: 0.001--0.151]---well below the observed $R^2 = 0.218$. The analytical formula confirms: $\\text{SNR} \\times \\text{EF} / (\\text{SNR} \\times \\text{EF} + 1) = 0.042$ with the same effective factor $\\text{EF} = 3.35$. This ${\\sim}5\\times$ gap reflects the dilution from zero-confusion pairs: approximately 89\\% of type pairs never exhibit mutual confusion, contributing only noise to the unconditional correlation. The conditional model ($R^2 = 0.074 \\to 0.219$) matches the observed value because it isolates the minority of semantically proximate pairs that actually compete during type resolution; BCS predicts batch accuracy through the density of \\emph{active} confusable pairs, not uniform contributions from all pairs.\n\n\\section{Split-Origin Covariate Analysis}\n\\label{app:split-origin}\n\nFewRel combines 64 train-split and 16 val-split relation types into a single 80-type pool.  Train-origin types show numerically lower accuracy ($-8.8$\\,pp, $p = 0.06$; see Limitations), raising the question of whether differential pre-training exposure confounds the BCS--accuracy relationship.  We test this by adding a per-batch \\emph{train-origin ratio} (fraction of relation types drawn from the train split) as a covariate in the BCS--accuracy regression.\n\n\\paragraph{Method.}  Across 213 multi-type batches ($k \\geq 2$) from the batch-composition experiment (\\S\\ref{sec:sdgd}) and the factorial design (\\S\\ref{sec:bcs_controlled}), we compute $\\texttt{train\\_origin\\_ratio} = n_{\\text{train}} / k$ for each batch.  The ratio ranges from 0.40 to 1.00 (mean 0.80, reflecting the 64/80 base rate).  We fit:\n\\[\n\\text{accuracy} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_{\\text{BCS}} \\cdot \\text{BCS} + \\beta_{\\text{origin}} \\cdot \\text{train\\_origin\\_ratio} + \\varepsilon\n\\]\n\n\\paragraph{Results.}  The BCS partial effect is unchanged after controlling for split-origin: $\\beta_{\\text{BCS}} = -0.416$, $p < 10^{-16}$ (vs.\\ $\\beta = -0.412$, $p < 10^{-16}$ without the covariate).  Train-origin ratio is not independently significant ($\\beta_{\\text{origin}} = -0.057$, $p = 0.245$), and $\\Delta R^2 = 0.005$.  The BCS--accuracy relationship is therefore not confounded by differential pre-training exposure at the batch level.\n\n\\section{Cross-Seed Variance Decomposition}\n\\label{app:variance-decomposition}\n\n\\begin{table}[h]\n\\centering\n\\small\n\\begin{tabular}{rrrr}\n\\toprule\n\\textbf{Count} & \\textbf{Batch SD} & \\textbf{Seed SD} & \\textbf{Ratio} \\\\\n\\midrule\n4 & 0.0889 & 0.0122 & 53.5 \\\\\n8 & 0.0820 & 0.0098 & 70.0 \\\\\n16 & 0.0626 & 0.0270 & 5.4 \\\\\n32 & 0.0462 & 0.0091 & 26.0 \\\\\n40 & 0.0421 & 0.0019 & 474.4 \\\\\n64 & 0.0245 & 0.0022 & 119.8 \\\\\n80 & 0.0001 & 0.0088 & $<$0.1 \\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}\n\\caption{Variance decomposition on FewRel (3 seeds $\\times$ 25 batches per count level).

At count 80, the full schema admits only one composition, leaving model inference noise as the sole variance source (seed SD = 0.88\\,pp).\n\n\\section{Cross-Domain Connections}\n\\label{app:cross-domain}\n\nThe schema-induced degradation documented here is not unique to information extraction. Schema-Guided Dialogue systems (SGD/SGD-X; \\citealt{rastogi2020towards}) face an analogous challenge: as the number of intent and slot types grows, dialogue state tracking accuracy declines. \\citet{li2023evaluating} observed count-dependent degradation in ChatGPT-based IE, attributing it to prompt overload. Our two-channel decomposition offers a more refined explanation: schema size per se is not the sole driver; rather, larger schemas increase the probability of including high-SCS pairs, which contribute disproportionately to confusion. This distinction has practical implications---a schema of 80 types with low mutual confusability may outperform a 40-type schema with clustered semantics---and suggests that confusability-aware design principles may generalize to any task where an LLM must discriminate among a prompt-specified label inventory.\n\n\\end{document}\n",

References start on page 11, so the main body (including Limitations) is 10 pages of content before References. The SDGD section with the new paragraph is on page 8. This is within the acceptable range (the task says ≤9 pages for content before references; if it were >9 we'd move the table to appendix, but at 10 pages we should check if this is the actual body or if it includes the checklist).

Let me check what's on pages 9-10.

Page 9 is Discussion/Conclusion, page 10 is Limitations. This is the standard ACL format where Limitations don't count against the page limit. The body (Introduction through Conclusion) fits within 9 pages. The routing table is in the appendix, not body. All good.

Let me do a final sanity check on the edited sdgd_negative.tex to confirm the new paragraph reads well.

20	\paragraph{Oracle routing as performance ceiling.}
21	Oracle routing routes each test instance to the batch containing its gold type, eliminating cross-type confusion within each batch. On FewRel 80-relation RE, oracle-routed decomposition achieves 0.802 accuracy versus 0.504 for the single-pass baseline---a gain of +29.8\,pp (Table~\ref{tab:batch_composition}). This is the strongest positive finding of the decomposition experiments: it demonstrates that type confusability is indeed a key driver of degradation in RE, and that performance recovers substantially when confusable types are separated.
22	
23	However, oracle routing requires gold labels and is not deployable. The gap between the oracle ceiling and practical routing reveals an important asymmetry: while \emph{any} decomposition benefits enormously from removing the 80-type bottleneck (+28.4\,pp for random batching, +29.8\,pp for graph coloring), the \emph{additional} benefit of confusability-aware grouping over random grouping is modest (+1.4\,pp, $p \approx 0.19$). The confusability-aware strategy ranks 13th out of 15 random seeds, limited by the narrow BCS margin (0.006) between graph-coloring and random batches at this partition granularity. Finer-grained partitioning or alternative confusability metrics may be needed to translate the oracle-demonstrated potential into significant practical gains.
24	
25	\paragraph{Practical routing strategies.}
26	We evaluate five non-oracle routing strategies on the same FewRel 80-relation task: max-confidence (all predictions), max-confidence (positive only), none-aware selection, margin-based routing, and random assignment. All five perform below the single-pass baseline (50.4\%), with the best practical strategy reaching only 36.5\% accuracy (Table~\ref{tab:routing_strategies}, Appendix~\ref{sec:appendix_routing}). The root cause is constrained decoding: the enum constraint forces the model to produce a confident type prediction for every sub-schema, even when the correct type is absent from the candidate set. As a result, 73.4\% of instances receive positive predictions from 3--5 sub-schemas simultaneously, and the none-rate per sub-schema is only 20--40\%. Confidence signals become unreliable when every sub-schema produces high-confidence outputs, rendering all confidence-based routing ineffective. The oracle gain (+22.0\,pp over single-pass) therefore depends on a routing signal that constrained decoding systematically destroys. Free-form generation or calibrated confidence estimation may provide more reliable routing signals for future work.

All edits complete. Compilation succeeds with no undefined references, body fits within page limits.

**Summary of changes:**
1. **sdgd_negative.tex** — Added `\paragraph{Practical routing strategies.}` after the oracle routing discussion, documenting the failure of all 5 practical strategies (best 36.5% vs 50.4% single-pass) and the constrained-decoding root cause.
2. **introduction.tex** — Contribution 4 upgraded from "merge limitations" to "systematic routing failure," now mentioning 7 strategies tested with the key 36.5% vs 50.4% comparison.
3. **main.tex** (appendix) — Added `\subsection{Practical Routing Strategies on RE}` with Table~\ref{tab:routing_strategies} in the SDGD appendix section.
4. **supplementary.tex** — Same table added for standalone supplementary compilation.
5. **abstract.tex** — No change needed; existing text is already compatible.
