## Core Claims (2 claims) — Revised per D019

1. **Confusability Independence**: Type confusability independently predicts extraction quality degradation in training-free LLM IE, beyond what type count alone explains. The signal is strongest and most robust at the **type-pair level** (pairwise SCS → confusion), validated across NER (Few-NERD), RE (FewRel), and ED (MAVEN with MiniLM). Per-type aggregation (mean BCS) introduces a centrality confound in semantically homogeneous schemas. The effect amplifies with schema complexity (3.4× between 16-type and 80-type schemas). Evidence required: (a) significant pairwise SCS-confusion correlation on >=2 datasets, (b) BCS-controlled accuracy gap on FewRel, (c) >=2 models.

2. **Multi-Channel Degradation**: Count and confusability degrade extraction through distinct channels -- count causes entity omission (recall decline), while confusability causes type confusion errors (correct spans labeled with wrong types). The channels show bounded interaction in both sentence-level RE (TOST p=0.003 at ±3pp) and document-level RE (raw interaction -9.4pp reduces to 0.93pp, CI[-7.13, 7.44] after BCS range matching — confirming the raw interaction was a BCS range restriction artifact). Cross-task validated: NER IntraSub ρ=1.0, RE IntraSub ρ=0.954. Evidence required: error taxonomy showing differential error types per channel, monotonic trends in separate metrics.

~~3. **SDGD Effectiveness**~~ — **DROPPED (D019)**: SDGD-zero v1 F1=0.251, v2 F1=0.241, both far below single-pass baseline 0.445. Merge amplification is an intrinsic challenge of schema decomposition that merge strategies (union+dedup, confidence-gated) cannot resolve. **Discussed as negative result + future work direction** — "why naive decomposition fails" is itself a contribution. Cross-task: MAVEN ED confirms merge amplification (precision collapse 0.287→0.091, pred_count inflation 3.7×).

## Story Spine — Revised per D012

- **Problem**: Training-free LLM IE degrades severely on complex schemas (20-60 F1 gap vs supervised). All existing decomposition approaches operate on unvalidated assumptions about WHAT makes schemas complex for LLMs.

- **Existing approaches & their gaps**: UniNER splits per-type (gains 3.3 F1 but loses cross-type context, no criterion for when to split). LLM-PEE uses similarity as implicit confusability proxy (never validated empirically). No prior work isolates confusability from count, or characterizes when aggregated confusability measures lose signal.

- **Our framing**: We conduct the first controlled empirical study isolating type confusability from type count in training-free LLM IE across three tasks (NER, RE, ED). We discover: (1) a multi-channel degradation model (count→recall, confusability→type confusion), (2) pairwise type confusability is a robust cross-task signal that amplifies with schema complexity, (3) per-type aggregation of confusability is confounded by type centrality in homogeneous schemas. We further show that naive confusability-aware decomposition (SDGD) fails due to merge amplification — a structural challenge across span-based tasks (NER, ED) that points to calibration-based approaches as future work.

- **Three-task validation**:
  - NER (Few-NERD, 66 types, cross-domain): Pairwise r=0.112 [0.076, 0.156] (n=1953), per-type ρ=-0.293 [-0.492, -0.054] (p=0.02), 10-28x confusion ratio
  - RE (FewRel, 80 relations, cross-domain): BCS-controlled Δ=-31.2pp (80-rel formal); count curve acc 85.7%→50.4%; BCS effect scales 3.4x vs 16-rel
  - ED (MAVEN, 168 event types, same-domain): Pairwise MiniLM r=0.120 (p≈0); per-type positive (centrality confound case study)

- **Headline result template**: "Pairwise type confusability independently predicts extraction degradation across NER, RE, and ED tasks (r=0.11-0.13, all CIs exclude zero), with 10-28x more type confusion errors in high-confusability batches. The effect amplifies with schema complexity: 3.4× stronger BCS effect on 80-type vs 16-type schemas (Δ=-31.2pp vs -9.1pp). On semantically homogeneous schemas, per-type aggregation obscures the signal through centrality confounding, but pairwise confusability remains valid."

## Core Insight — Multi-Channel Degradation + Pairwise Robustness

Schema-induced degradation in LLM IE is not a single phenomenon but a multi-channel process:
- **Channel 1 (Count -> Recall)**: More types in the prompt → attention dilution → entities missed. Monotonic, near-linear. Addressable by reducing batch size.
- **Channel 2 (Confusability -> Type Confusion)**: Semantically similar co-present types → interference during type assignment → correct entities labeled with wrong types. Addressable by separating confusable types into different batches.

These channels exhibit bounded interaction across both sentence-level RE (FewRel TOST p=0.003 at ±3pp) and document-level RE (DocRED raw interaction -9.4pp reduces to 0.93pp after BCS range matching, CI crosses zero). The raw DocRED interaction was an artifact of BCS range restriction (spread 0.26 vs 0.38 at different count levels). After controlling for achievable BCS ranges, the two dimensions operate independently on DocRED as on FewRel. Both channels are independently addressable.

**Pairwise vs Aggregated Confusability**:
- **Pairwise confusability** (SCS between type pairs) is robust across all tasks and schema types. Validated on Few-NERD (Qwen3, r=0.112 [0.076, 0.156]) and MAVEN (MiniLM, r=0.129 [0.104, 0.156]). SCS validated as effective confusion proxy: Qwen3 ρ=0.168 (p=7e-14), MiniLM ρ=0.306 nonzero-only (p=5e-6).
- **Per-type aggregation** (mean BCS = average pairwise similarity to all other types) introduces a centrality confound: in semantically homogeneous schemas (MAVEN), types with many semantic neighbors are central, well-represented types that LLMs extract well → positive correlation (high mean BCS → high F1), masking the pairwise confusability signal.
- **SDGD operates at pairwise level**, directly using the validated signal to construct the confusability graph for decomposition. It avoids the aggregation confound entirely.

## Evidence Hierarchy (D012)

### Tier 1: PRIMARY — Pairwise SCS → Confusion

The cleanest evidence. Directly measures: are semantically similar type pairs more often confused?

**Few-NERD (NER)** — Qwen3 embeddings:
- Pearson r=0.112 [0.076, 0.156] (n=1953 type pairs) — corrected via bootstrap recomputation
- Nonzero-only Spearman ρ=0.272 (p=5e-5)
- Top confused pairs are all high-BCS semantic neighbors (person-other ↔ person-politician, BCS=0.934)
- Immune to type frequency confound (operates at type-pair level)

**MAVEN (ED)** — MiniLM embeddings:
- Pearson r=+0.129 [0.104, 0.156] (n=11026 type pairs) — corrected via bootstrap
- Nonzero-only Spearman ρ=+0.191 (p<0.001)
- Cross-task replication on same-domain schema
- Note: Qwen3 pairwise not significant on MAVEN (r=-0.007, p=0.41) — embedding choice matters for pairwise signal in homogeneous schemas

### Tier 2: STRONG SECONDARY — FewRel Cross-Task Replication

Large effect size, cross-task (RE), scaling with schema complexity:

**Formal 80-rel study** (exp_fewrel_formal_80rel):
- Count curve: acc 85.7% (count=1) → 50.4% (count=80), BCS 0→0.97
- BCS-controlled: count_8 low-BCS 82.3% vs high-BCS 51.0% (Δ=-31.2pp)
- BCS-controlled: count_16 low-BCS 82.8% vs high-BCS 51.6% (Δ=-31.2pp)
- **Scaling**: vs 16-rel, degradation 2.8x (35.3pp vs 12.6pp), BCS effect 3.4x (-31.2pp vs -9.1pp)

**16-rel sanity check** (exp_fewrel_formal):
- count_8: low-BCS 88.9% vs high-BCS 79.8% (Δ=-9.1pp)

**Pilot extreme batches** (fewrel_pilot, MiniLM):
- count_4: Δ=-20.9pp, count_8: Δ=-50.0pp, count_16: Δ=-48.6pp

Key insight: confusability effect amplifies with schema size — direct evidence for multi-channel degradation scaling

### Tier 3: SUPPORTING — Few-NERD Per-type Analysis

Bridges pairwise and batch-level, demonstrates per-type signal in cross-domain schema:
- Spearman ρ=-0.293 (p=0.020, n=63 types, freq≥5) — Qwen3 embeddings
- Partial r=-0.200 (p=0.116) controlling for log-frequency
- Quartile comparison: high-BCS types F1=0.228 vs low-BCS F1=0.310 (Δ=-8.2pp)
- BCS-frequency uncorrelated at type level (r=0.042, p=0.74)
- MiniLM per-type: ρ≈0 (p=0.97) — extraction model alignment required for per-type signal

### Tier 4: DISCUSSION — MAVEN Per-type Centrality Confound

Methodological case study on when aggregated confusability measures fail:
- Qwen3 per-type: ρ=+0.189 (p=0.021) — OPPOSITE direction
- MiniLM per-type: ρ=+0.208 (p=0.011) — ALSO positive, ruling out embedding compression as sole explanation
- Both embeddings agree: positive direction on MAVEN is an intrinsic property of the type structure
- Explanation: in homogeneous schemas, mean BCS conflates confusability with type centrality (types with many semantic neighbors → common/central types → higher F1)
- This is stronger than "domain boundary" — it identifies the specific mechanism (aggregation confound) rather than just the boundary condition

### Tier 5: MECHANISTIC — Error Taxonomy (Cross-Task)

IntraSub rate monotonically increases with BCS on both NER and RE:

**Few-NERD (NER, exp-007)**: IntraSub 0%→1.6%→10.6%→49.4%, ρ=1.0
**FewRel 80-rel (RE)**: IntraSub 0%→4.2%→13.0%→20.3%→32.3%, ρ=0.954 (p=0.0, n=154 batches)
- extra_sub=0 on both tasks — type confusion is purely intra-batch phenomenon
- Same mechanism, different absolute magnitudes — consistent with cross-task expectations

Additional from extreme batch design:
- Extreme batches: high-BCS 10-28x more type confusion errors vs low-BCS
- Random batches: 1.7-2.4x ratio (still significant, smaller effect)

## Embedding Ablation (D010)

2×3 matrix: {Qwen3, MiniLM} × {Few-NERD, FewRel, MAVEN}

### Per-type (Layer 2)
| | Few-NERD | FewRel | MAVEN |
|---|---|---|---|
| Qwen3 | ρ=-0.293 ✓ | pending | ρ=+0.189 ✗ |
| MiniLM | ρ≈0 ✗ | Δ=21-50pp ✓ | ρ=+0.208 ✗ |

### Pairwise (Layer 1)
| | Few-NERD | MAVEN |
|---|---|---|
| Qwen3 | r=0.112 [0.076,0.156] ✓ | r=-0.007 ✗ |
| MiniLM | — | r=+0.129 [0.104,0.156] ✓ |

### SCS→Empirical Confusion Validation (exp-015 fast)
| | Qwen3 | MiniLM |
|---|---|---|
| All pairs ρ | 0.168 (p=7e-14) ✓ | 0.144 (p=2e-10) ✓ |
| Nonzero-only ρ | 0.272 (p=5e-5) | 0.306 (p=5e-6) ✓ |

**Interpretation**: No single embedding dominates. Extraction-model embeddings (Qwen3) capture per-type confusability in cross-domain schemas. Generic embeddings (MiniLM) capture pairwise confusability in same-domain schemas. SDGD should use task-appropriate embeddings; SDGD-cal (empirical confusion) bypasses embedding choice entirely.

## Venue Fit Risks

- **"Just an empirical study"**: Mitigated by SDGD as direct operationalization. Controlled experimental design parallels "Lost in the Middle" (TACL 2024).
- **Training-free IE relevance**: Cite deployment scenarios — clinical, regulatory, multilingual.
- **Multi-model generalizability**: Qwen3-32B primary + LLaMA-3.1-70B-Instruct (FP8) (exp-012).
- **MAVEN doesn't support hypothesis?**: Pairwise MiniLM does support it. Per-type centrality confound is methodological contribution, not failure.
- **Embedding sensitivity**: 2×3 ablation matrix is itself a contribution — characterizes when which proxy works.
