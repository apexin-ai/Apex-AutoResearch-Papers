This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The summary below covers the earlier portion of the conversation.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   I am the Research Reviewer (Loop #14) for the `recursive_gen_depth_est` project targeting EMNLP 2026 Main (ARR May 25, ~7 days remaining). My role is independent scientific auditor with read-only access, posting findings via `reviewer_post_to_director`. This session continued from a context compaction. Key tasks this session:
   - Monitor 14B scale validation experiments (qwen25_14b_scale_002 on gpu-6000pro-2, qwen25_14b_scale_003 on westd-48862)
   - Discover and report that prompted_gen_gpt2xl_001 actually completed successfully (69.52%) despite registry marking it "failed"
   - Conduct comprehensive pre-submission story review across 5 dimensions (claim strength, story consistency, reviewer attacks, missing ablations, 14B contingency)
   - Verify D039 fixes were implemented in paper files after ROADMAP update

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - Recursive generation depth estimation: ordinal classification of d0 (human) through d3+ (recursive generations)
   - Depth Degradation Atlas: 3×3 grid (Pythia-1.4B × OLMo-1B × GPT-2 XL) × (nucleus × temperature × top-k) × 4 depths, 180K samples
   - Effective Discriminable Depth (EDD): EDD₀.₇₅=4 for all three models (but statistical strength stratified: Pythia p=0.001, OLMo p=0.091, GPT-2 XL p=0.505)
   - AUC-excess contraction: non-uniform (0.64-0.88 Pythia range), 3-model mean ratios 0.80→0.73→0.69
   - Feature bottleneck: RF/XGBoost/LightGBM converge within ≤0.4pp; p90_ppl alone 58.3% (80.4% of above-chance)
   - Cross-model LOO: 66.4% mean, d2 recall as low as 26.8%
   - Cross-strategy: 59.1% mean, d1/d2 boundary inversion under temperature
   - Two-stage pipeline: strategy ID (57.8%) → conditioned depth = +11.5pp
   - 14B FP16 scale validation: Qwen2.5-14B on two servers for cross-hardware reproducibility
   - Prompted generation ecological validity: 69.52% (delta -13.78pp vs BOS-seeded 83.3%)
   - GPU compliance: projects must only use allocated GPU IDs (cuda:0 for both 14B experiments)

3. Files and Code Sections:
   - `docs/paper/abstract.tex` (verified)
     - Updated to "eight axes" (was seven), added "prompted generation at 69.5%"
     - "robust" now qualified: "robust across model families but strategy-dependent"
     - Line 6: `Systematic generalization across eight axes (e.g., cross-scale with 7B models at 70.2\%, prompted generation at 69.5\%, cross-domain, and LoRA-rank ablation) confirms that depth signal is robust across model families but strategy-dependent, residing in distributional statistics inaccessible from surface text (zero-shot LLMs: 30--36\%, 43\,pp below RF).`
   
   - `docs/paper/method.tex` (verified fix)
     - Line 35 changed FROM: "extending to prompt-conditioned generation is future work"
     - Line 35 changed TO: "a prompted-generation validation (§ref) confirms signal persistence under topic-seeded conditions (−13.8pp vs. BOS-seeded)"
   
   - `docs/paper/discussion.tex` (verified data)
     - Now 4 paragraphs (expanded from 1 in previous session)
     - Line 9: LoRA loss data verified against results_summary.json (Pythia 2.22→1.37→1.01, OLMo 2.27→1.65→1.23, GPT-2 XL 2.55→1.72→1.34)
     - Line 20: Still says "scaling evaluation to 14B+ models are immediate next steps" (will need update when 14B completes)
   
   - `docs/paper/generalization.tex` (read, verified)
     - Classifier comparison (RF/XGB/LGBM ≤0.4pp spread)
     - Surface-text ablation (mean PPL at chance 25.1%)
     - Cross-model transfer (66.4%), cross-strategy (59.1%), cross-scale (7B: 70.2%/60.1%)
     - p90_ppl single-feature 58.3%, feature-group ablation, RF seed robustness
   
   - `docs/paper/conclusion.tex` (read, Limitations section)
     - 12+ paragraphs covering cross-strategy, d0 inflation, ecological gap, FPR, adversarial, EDD monotonicity, reference model, LoRA seed
   
   - `docs/paper/introduction.tex` (read)
     - 4 contributions, consistent with results
   
   - `docs/paper/atlas.tex` lines 110-159 (read)
     - EDD analysis section, AUC-excess contraction correctly described as non-uniform
     - Lines 121-125: "contraction ratio decreases from 0.80 to 0.69" with per-model Pythia range 0.64-0.88
   
   - `artifacts/_project/data/results_summary.json` (read in full)
     - Core 3×3 matrix, instruct model, learned estimator, baseline comparison, prompted_gen, wild data FPR, downstream train loss, theory AUC values, cross-model LOO, EDD, supplementary data including finetune_losses_by_model and depth_extension_binary_pairwise
   
   - `paper_provenance.yaml` (read in full, ~48KB)
     - 122 claims (C001-C122), 7 tables, 4 figures
     - Coverage: 112/126 at time of reading, later updated to 118/132 per ROADMAP
     - C106 stale (geometric decay gamma~0.74), should be deprecated in favor of C122
     - C096, C097 (Llama-3.1-8B) have empty evidence arrays
   
   - `paper_framing.md` (read in full)
     - 3 Core Claims + Discussion implication
     - Story spine, DCOL contingency, venue fit risks
     - 12 anticipated reviewer concerns with defenses
   
   - Remote files verified via ssh_read_only:
     - `/root/autodl-tmp/recursive_gen_depth_est/results/prompted_generation/summary.json`: Complete results (69.52%, CI, AUC, top5 features)
     - `/root/autodl-tmp/recursive_gen_depth_est/data/qwen25_14b/`: d0.jsonl (5000 lines, 7,142,142 bytes on both servers), d1.jsonl growing
     - `/root/autodl-tmp/recursive_gen_depth_est/checkpoints/qwen25_14b/`: lora_depth_0 saved on both servers

4. Errors and Fixes:
   - **ssh_read_only semicolon blocking**: Commands with `;` were blocked by the read-only allowlist. Fixed by using separate ssh calls instead of chained commands.
   - **`date` command blocked**: Not in read-only allowlist. Worked around by comparing file modification timestamps to infer current server time.
   - **Registry filter returning empty for prompted_gen**: When filtering by `exp_id: "prompted_gen_gpt2xl_001"`, returned 0 results. But the experiment appeared in the full DONE list. Likely an exact-match issue with the filter system. Worked around by listing all DONE experiments.
   - **scale_002 log showing TLS failure**: The log file `/root/runs/recursive_gen_depth_est/qwen25_14b_scale_002.log` showed an aria2 download failure (EXIT_CODE=1), but nvidia-smi confirmed PID 806751 was actively using GPU at 87%. Verified process was alive via `nvidia-smi --query-compute-apps` and confirmed d1 file was growing. The log reflected an old download failure; the actual process continued.

5. Problem Solving:
   - **Prompted_gen data integrity discovery**: Found that prompted_gen_gpt2xl_001 experiment completed successfully with valid results (69.52%, 20K samples, complete data pipeline) but was marked "failed" in registry due to startup recovery. Method.tex incorrectly claimed this was "future work." Posted WARNING to Director. This was subsequently fixed in D039 — method.tex updated, registry corrected, results integrated into paper.
   - **14B cross-hardware consistency**: Independently verified d0 data file sizes identical (7,142,142 bytes both servers) and d0 LoRA training losses consistent (0.5462 vs 0.5451, delta 0.0011). GPU compliance confirmed (both using only cuda:0).
   - **Provenance staleness**: Found C106 still referencing "geometric AUC decay gamma~0.74" which was fixed in atlas.tex to "non-uniform contraction." C122 has correct data. Reported as non-urgent.
   - **Discussion.tex data verification**: Cross-checked all LoRA loss numbers against results_summary.json. All matched within rounding.
   - **Abstract number verification**: Verified all quantitative claims (69-86%, EDD=4, 66.4%, 7B 70.2%, zero-shot 30-36%, 43pp gap).

6. All User Messages:
   - **[Initial context]**: System reminders with pre-read files (worker result, generalization.tex, conclusion.tex, discussion.tex, introduction.tex) from context compaction
   - **"Continue from where you left off."** (multiple times after tool results loaded)
   - **"[System 触发审查: 投稿前整体 Story 审查请求]"**: Comprehensive pre-submission story review with 5 specific questions about claim strength, story consistency, reviewer attack angles, missing ablations, and 14B contingency
   - **"[系统通知 — worker_done:worker_ops_14b-status-westd48862_20260518T034420]"**: Worker completed, asked to review Agent's handling
   - **"Continue from where you left off."** (after worker review)
   - **"[系统通知 — worker_done:worker_ops_prompted-gen-verify_20260518T034636]"**: Worker verified prompted_gen results are real
   - **"Continue from where you left off."** (after prompted-gen verify)
   - **"[系统通知 — worker_done:worker_ops_14b-status-westd_20260518T040646]"**: Second westd status check worker
   - **"Continue from where you left off."** (after status check)
   - **"[系统通知 — worker_done:worker_ops_read-prompted-gen-summary_20260518T040930]"**: Worker read prompted_gen summary.json
   - **"Continue from where you left off."** (after summary read)
   - **"[系统通知 — roadmap_updated]"**: ROADMAP.md updated with D039 fixes, prompted gen integration, submission checklist update — asked to review research direction and plan reasonability

7. Pending Tasks:
   - **14B experiment completion audit**: scale_002 (gpu-6000pro-2, ETA ~5/19 03:00 server time) and scale_003 (westd-48862, ETA ~5/18 late afternoon+). When complete: verify AUC metrics, check cross-server consistency, GPU compliance, compare with 1.5B baseline
   - **14B paper patch review**: After results are in, Paper Agent will integrate — need to review the patch
   - **Provenance completion**: Currently 118/132, will expand after 14B patch
   - **Final pre-submission review**: Before ARR May 25 deadline
   - **Registry prompted_gen verification**: Last filter attempt returned empty; ROADMAP says "registry 已修正为 success" but I haven't independently confirmed the registry update

8. Current Work:
   I was verifying that the D039 fixes (triggered by my comprehensive story review) were actually implemented in the paper files. I confirmed:
   - method.tex line 35: Fixed from "future work" to citing prompted generation results ✓
   - abstract.tex: "robust" qualified with "across model families but strategy-dependent" + updated to "eight axes" + added "prompted generation at 69.5%" ✓
   - Registry filter for prompted_gen_gpt2xl_001 returned empty (needs re-verification, but ROADMAP says corrected)
   
   The ROADMAP update shows all D039 items completed:
   - Discussion expansion ✓
   - EDD wording ✓
   - Abstract robust limitation ✓
   - Binoculars citation ✓
   - Prompted gen integration ✓
   - Bootstrap CIs (plan_020) done ✓
   - Binoculars ordinal baseline (plan_018) done ✓

9. Optional Next Step:
   Post a confirmation/verification report to Director on D039 fixes. My ROADMAP review was triggered by "[系统通知 — roadmap_updated]: ROADMAP.md 已更新...请审查研究方向和计划的合理性." I read the ROADMAP and started verifying the claimed fixes. The verification is mostly complete (method.tex ✓, abstract.tex ✓). Remaining items to verify:
   - Confirm prompted_gen registry actually updated to "success" (filter returned empty, may need to try full registry read)
   - Check if Binoculars/Fast-DetectGPT results are now in generalization.tex §5.1
   - Check if Bootstrap CIs are in Table 1
   - Post ROADMAP review verdict to Director
   
   Then return to monitoring 14B experiments (scale_002 at ~4500/5000 d1, scale_003 at ~2715/5000 d1).

If you need specific details from before compaction (like exact code snippets, error messages, or content you generated), read the full transcript at: /home/ubuntu/.claude-account-3/projects/-home-ubuntu--agent-ml-research-idea-gen-0513-2-projects-recursive-gen-depth-est--claude-sessions-reviewer-2647e3b4/9eadbcc4-a208-420f-b3d3-dc61970d6e63.jsonl
Continue the conversation from where it left off without asking the user any further questions. Resume directly — do not acknowledge the summary, do not recap what was happening, do not preface with "I'll continue" or similar. Pick up the last task as if the break never happened.

Let me continue from where I left off. I need to:

1. Verify remaining D039 fixes (Binoculars/Fast-DetectGPT in generalization.tex, Bootstrap CIs in Table 1, registry update for prompted_gen)
2. Post ROADMAP review verdict to Director
3. Continue monitoring 14B experiments

Let me start by checking the remaining verification items in parallel.
```

only 1.9pp lower — well within the hypothesis that depth signal is decoding-strategy-agnostic.\\n2. **Ordinal structure preserved**: AUC ordering 0v1 > 1v3 > 1v2 > 2v3 identical to baseline, confirming the difficulty gradient d0≫d1>d2>d3 is robust.\\n3. **d2 remains the weak link**: d2 recall (0.554 in 3-class) is the lowest, consistent with baseline — d2 is the hardest to distinguish from both d1 and d3.\\n4. **Feature importance stable**: Top-5 features identical between strategies with near-identical importance weights, suggesting the same statistical signatures carry depth information regardless of decoding method.\\n5. **Higher code contamination**: Temp09 shows 2-3pp higher code-like content across depths, possibly because temperature-only sampling without top-p truncation preserves more of the distribution tail including code patterns. The filtered 3-class acc (72.52%) mitigates this.\\n6. **Conclusion: SUCCESS** — 4-class acc 76.25% >> 40% threshold, d1v2 AUC 0.8327 >> 0.6 threshold.

1	\label{sec:atlas}
2	
3	We present the Depth Degradation Atlas: a systematic empirical map of how statistical fingerprints evolve across recursive generation depths, models, and decoding strategies.
4	The atlas spans $3 \times 3 = 9$ model--strategy cells evaluated at depths $d \in \{0, 1, 2, 3\}$, with depth extensions to $d{=}5$ for cross-model EDD validation (\S\ref{sec:atlas:edd}).
5	
6	%% ----------------------------------------------------------------
7	\subsection{In-Distribution Performance}
8	\label{sec:atlas:id}
9	
10	Table~\ref{tab:main_matrix} reports four-class Random Forest accuracy (5-fold CV, 200 trees) across all nine cells.
11	Accuracy ranges from 68.8\% (Pythia, top-$k$) to 85.9\% (GPT-2~XL, temperature), all exceeding the 25\% chance baseline by a wide margin.
12	Two axis effects emerge.
13	GPT-2~XL achieves the highest accuracy under every strategy (75.9--85.9\%), followed by OLMo (74.5--82.1\%) and Pythia (68.8--78.7\%).
14	Top-$k$ sampling yields the lowest accuracy in every model.
15	The mean within-model strategy gap is 9.2~pp, comparable to the 7.2~pp mean within-strategy model gap; decoding strategy and model family contribute roughly equally to performance variance.
16	
17	\begin{table}[t]
18	\centering
19	\small
20	\caption{Four-class RF accuracy (\%) with bootstrap 95\% CI (${\pm}$half-width; 10{,}000 resamples) across the $3 \times 3$ atlas; d1--d3 three-class accuracy in parentheses (chance = 25\% / 33\%). Depth-0 recall exceeds 98\% in all cells.}
21	\label{tab:main_matrix}
22	\begin{tabular}{@{}lccc@{}}
23	\toprule
24	& Nucleus & Temp.\ $\tau{=}0.9$ & Top-$k$ \\
25	\midrule
26	Pythia-1.4B  & 78.7{\scriptsize$\pm$0.5}\,(71.2) & 76.7{\scriptsize$\pm$0.5}\,(70.6) & 68.8{\scriptsize$\pm$0.6}\,(58.8) \\
27	OLMo-1B     & 78.9{\scriptsize$\pm$0.5}\,(75.0) & 82.1{\scriptsize$\pm$0.5}\,(76.3) & 74.5{\scriptsize$\pm$0.5}\,(66.1) \\
28	GPT-2~XL    & \textbf{84.1}{\scriptsize$\pm$0.5}\,(79.0) & \textbf{85.9}{\scriptsize$\pm$0.5}\,(82.6) & \textbf{75.9}{\scriptsize$\pm$0.6}\,(69.5) \\
29	\bottomrule
30	\end{tabular}
31	\end{table}
32	
33	\paragraph{Per-class recall distribution.}
34	Depth-0 recall exceeds 98\% in all 9 cells, confirming that human-written text is trivially separable from any generation depth.
35	Among generated depths, d2 consistently yields the lowest recall (46--73\% across cells), followed by d3 (58--82\%) and d1 (72--91\%).
36	For example, Pythia-1.4B nucleus achieves per-class recall of d0$\,{=}\,$99\%, d1$\,{=}\,$82\%, d2$\,{=}\,$59\%, d3$\,{=}\,$72\%.
37	The strongest d2 recall is obtained by GPT-2~XL nucleus (73\%).
38	The d2 trough reflects its position at the center of the depth gradient: d2 features overlap with both the d1 distribution above and d3 below, making it the most confusable class, consistent with the d2-vs-d3 pair being the EDD bottleneck (\S\ref{sec:atlas:edd}).
39	Full per-class recall for all cells appears in Appendix~\ref{app:per_class}.
40	
41	%% ----------------------------------------------------------------
42	\subsection{Feature Consistency Across the Grid}
43	\label{sec:atlas:features}
44	
45	Despite the 17.1~pp accuracy spread across cells, a small feature family dominates in every setting.
46	Perplexity tail statistics as a feature group dominate depth discrimination: the 90th-percentile perplexity (\texttt{p90\_ppl}) ranks top-2 by Gini importance in all 9 cells; surprisal variance (\texttt{var\_surprisal}) in 8/9 under SHAP (7/9 under Gini; Appendix~\ref{app:permutation}).\footnote{Individual feature rankings should be interpreted cautiously given high multicollinearity (VIF${>}$10 for 14--16/19 features); the group-level dominance of perplexity tail statistics is robust across importance measures.}
47	Table~\ref{tab:feature_importance} shows the full per-cell ranking.
48	
49	Cross-model feature-rank Spearman correlation averages $\bar{\rho} = 0.868$ (range $[0.619, 0.954]$): models agree on which features carry depth information even when they differ in absolute accuracy.

1	\section{Generalization and Robustness}
2	\label{sec:generalization}
3	
4	We test whether atlas accuracy (68.8--85.9\%) reflects genuine statistical regularities across seven generalization axes (four below, three in Appendix).
5	
6	\subsection{Classifier Comparison and Surface-Text Ablation}
7	\label{sec:gen:baselines}
8	
9	Table~\ref{tab:baselines} evaluates bagging (RF) and gradient boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM) on the same 19 features; per-cell spread is $\leq$0.4pp, establishing a feature-determined ceiling.
10	On Pythia nucleus, CORAL ordinal regression \cite{coral2020} (78.1\%) and DivEye \cite{diveye2026} (78.2\%) match within-cell RF within 0.6\,pp ($p>0.05$, Bonferroni-corrected); all feature-based methods outperform CE-MLP (74.9\%, $p<0.001$) and logistic regression (75.0\%).
11	Binary detectors repurposed for ordinal classification (Binoculars + Fast-DetectGPT combined: 74.2\%) fall 4\,pp below RF (Appendix~\ref{app:detector_baselines}).
12	
13	\paragraph{Surface-text ablation.}
14	Single-feature regression on mean perplexity performs at chance (25.1\%); zero-shot LLMs (DeepSeek V3.2, 36.2\%; Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, 30.4\%) also fail (43\,pp below RF; Appendix~\ref{app:zeroshot_prompt}), confirming depth signal resides in distributional statistics inaccessible from surface text.
15	
16	\begin{table}[t]
17	\centering
18	\small
19	\caption{Classifier convergence: 4-class accuracy (\%) across three atlas cells. RF (bagging), XGBoost and LightGBM (gradient boosting) operate on the same 19 features; $\Delta_{\max}$: largest per-cell spread. Chance = 25\%. RF values differ from Table~\ref{tab:main_matrix} by $\leq$0.2pp due to matched-fold evaluation. 5-fold cross-validation standard deviation $\leq$ 0.9\,pp across all settings.}
20	\label{tab:baselines}
21	\begin{tabular}{@{}lcccc@{}}
22	\toprule
23	Cell & RF & XGB & LGBM & $\Delta_{\max}$ \\
24	\midrule
25	Pythia, nuc. & 78.8 & 79.0 & 78.9 & 0.2 \\
26	GPT-2~XL, $\tau$ & 85.8 & 86.2 & 86.2 & 0.4 \\
27	Pythia, top-$k$ & 68.9 & 68.9 & 68.7 & 0.2 \\
28	\bottomrule
29	\end{tabular}
30	\end{table}
31	
32	Convergence confirms the signal resides in the features, not the classifier; this ceiling extends to cross-model transfer, where XGBoost (67.2\%), ordinal MLP (66.7\%), and prototypical networks (66.6\%) all match the RF baseline (66.4\%) within 0.8\,pp (Appendix~\ref{app:learned_estimator}).
33	A feature-group ablation further localizes the signal: the 9 perplexity features alone recover 66.0\% ($-$0.5\,pp vs.\ full), while repetition/diversity features alone reach only 53.0\% ($-$13.6\,pp; Appendix~\ref{app:feature_ablation}), confirming perplexity degradation as the dominant depth marker.
34	Raw perplexity (mean/median) performs at chance (25.1\%); the strongest single feature (\texttt{p90\_ppl}) achieves 58.3\% ($-$8.3\,pp vs.\ full), confirming that ordinal depth estimation requires multi-dimensional characterization of the perplexity distribution rather than a single threshold.
35	Figure~\ref{fig:confusion_matrix} shows d0 near-perfectly identified; errors concentrate at d2/d3 in-distribution and spread to d1--d3 under transfer (seed std $= 0.06$\,pp; Appendix~\ref{app:rf_seed}).
36	
37	\begin{figure}[t]
38	\centering
39	\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figures/fig_confusion_matrix.pdf}
40	\caption{Confusion matrices for the best in-distribution setting (GPT-2 XL, temp $\tau{=}0.9$, 85.9\%) and the best cross-model leave-one-out transfer (OLMo holdout, 69.2\%). d0 recall exceeds 99\% in both; errors spread across the d1--d3 range under transfer.}
41	\label{fig:confusion_matrix}
42	\end{figure}
43	
44	\subsection{Cross-Model Transfer}
45	\label{sec:gen:crossmodel}
46	
47	We perform leave-one-model-family-out evaluation: train on two families (nucleus only), test on the held-out third (Table~\ref{tab:cross_model}).
48	
49	\begin{table}[t]
50	\centering
51	\small
52	\caption{Cross-model transfer (leave-one-out, nucleus only). Chance = 25\% / 33\% (d1--d3). d1--d3 bal.\ acc: Pythia 49.9\%, OLMo 59.2\%, GPT-2~XL 57.2\% (mean 55.4\%).}
53	\label{tab:cross_model}
54	\begin{tabular}{lccccc}
55	\toprule
56	Holdout & Acc & d0 & d1 & d2 & d3 \\

61	GPT-2 XL & 67.6 & 98.5 & 74.7 & 52.6 & 44.5 \\
62	\midrule
63	Mean & 66.4 & 99.3 & 66.5 & 40.9 & 59.0 \\
64	\bottomrule
65	\end{tabular}
66	\end{table}
67	
68	Mean transfer accuracy is 66.4\% (2.7$\times$ chance); d0 recall ($>$98\%) inflates the headline (d1--d3 balanced mean 55.4\%).
69	
70	\subsection{Cross-Strategy Transfer}
71	\label{sec:gen:crossstrategy}
72	
73	Table~\ref{tab:cross_strategy} reports leave-one-strategy-out transfer.
74	
75	\begin{table}[t]
76	\centering
77	\small
78	\caption{Cross-strategy transfer (leave-one-out). Chance = 25\% / 33\% (d1--d3). d0 recall $\geq$89\% inflates headline; d1--d3 mean: 45.9\%.}
79	\label{tab:cross_strategy}
80	\begin{tabular}{lccc}
81	\toprule
82	Holdout & Pythia & OLMo & GPT-2 XL \\
83	 & Acc (\%) & Acc (\%) & Acc (\%) \\
84	\midrule
85	nucleus & \textbf{69.4} & \textbf{65.4} & \textbf{59.9} \\
86	temp ($\tau{=}0.9$) & 62.8 & 58.2 & 56.1 \\
87	top-$k$ ($k{=}50$) & 51.5 & 54.9 & 53.6 \\
88	\bottomrule
89	\end{tabular}
90	\end{table}
91	
92	Mean cross-strategy accuracy (59.1\%) falls 7pp below cross-model transfer (66.4\%); excluding d0, d1--d3 accuracy drops to 45.9\% (chance = 33\%).
93	Training on nucleus + top-$k$ and testing on temperature inverts the d1/d2 boundary (d1v2 AUC $<$ 0.5); per-strategy z-score normalization partially recovers it but leaves a residual gap (Limitations).
94	A multi-temperature ablation (Appendix~\ref{app:multi_tau}) confirms within-$\tau$ signal for $\tau \leq 0.9$ but collapse at $\tau{=}1.1$; end-to-end PLMs lag RF by 20pp (Appendix~\ref{app:e2e}).
95	
96	\paragraph{Prompted generation.}
97	Replicating the GPT-2~XL nucleus pipeline with topic-seeded generation yields 69.5\% (95\% CI $[68.9, 70.2]$, $-$13.8\,pp vs.\ BOS-seeded, $2.8\times$ chance), with monotonic AUC decay and identical top features (Appendix~\ref{app:prompted_gen}): prompt conditioning attenuates but does not eliminate the depth signal.

103	Extending to 7--8B under QLoRA, Llama-3.1-8B Instruct achieves 70.2\% ($\mathrm{EDD}_{0.70}{=}4$) and Qwen2.5-7B 60.1\% ($\mathrm{EDD}_{0.70}{>}5$).
104	A base-model control (Llama-3.1-8B, 59.9\%, non-monotonic AUC) vs.\ instruction-tuned (70.2\%, monotonic) suggests instruction tuning \emph{regularizes} recursive degradation; a 1.5B instruct control (47.4\%, $1.9\times$ chance) confirms at matched scale (Appendix~\ref{app:instruct_1p5b}).
105	Cross-model chains (84.75\%), cross-domain (arXiv 74.1\%), and LoRA rank sensitivity ($\Delta{=}4.65$\,pp; Appendix~\ref{app:cross_scale_full}) further confirm robustness.

Good. Let me check the key findings:

1. **Binoculars/Fast-DetectGPT in generalization.tex**: Line 11 shows "Binary detectors repurposed for ordinal classification (Binoculars + Fast-DetectGPT combined: 74.2%) fall 4pp below RF (Appendix~\ref{app:detector_baselines})." ✓ This is present.

2. **Bootstrap CIs in Table 1 (main_matrix)**: Line 20-21 shows the caption mentions "bootstrap 95% CI (±half-width; 10,000 resamples)" and the table values include ±0.5/±0.6. ✓ Bootstrap CIs are in the main table.


3. **Prompted generation in generalization.tex**: Lines 96-97 confirm the prompted generation section with the 69.5% performance, confidence interval, -13.8pp drop, and top features listed. ✓ Now I'm searching through the registry to verify the prompted_gen status.

westd-48862 (scale_003):
- depth_0.jsonl: 7,142,142 bytes (complete, identical to gpu-6000pro-2 ✓)
- depth_1.jsonl: 3009/5000 lines (60.2%)

So the two servers:
- gpu-6000pro-2: d1 at 4809/5000 (96.2%) — will finish d1 very soon, then needs d1 LoRA finetune + d2 gen + d2 finetune + d3 gen + RF training


- westd-48862: d1 at 3009/5000 (60.2%) — slower, still has a ways to go

Now I'm preparing to post a ROADMAP review to the Director with the D039 fixes verification, the 14B experiment progress, and an overall assessment, so let me pull up the current ROADMAP to make sure everything's current before I send it.

Now I have a complete picture. Let me post the ROADMAP review to Director.

Key findings:
1. D039 all 7 fixes verified in paper files and registry ✓
2. 14B experiments progressing well:
   - gpu-6000pro-2 (scale_002): d1 at 4809/5000 (96.2%), will finish d1 imminently
   - westd-48862 (scale_003): d1 at 3009/5000 (60.2%)
   - ROADMAP estimates "scale_003 5/18 下午+, scale_002 5/19 凌晨" are reasonable


3. The remaining work looks manageable: plan_026 is blocked on an OpenAI key but that's not critical, and the other checklist items—14B patch, provenance completion, final review—are all reasonable. The timeline is tight with 7 days until the May 25 deadline, but feasible if the 14B experiments wrap up by 5/19. Provenance is at 118/132 and can be finished after the patch, and the paper length of 8 pages plus 14 pages of appendix is solid.

The only thing running right now is the 14B experiment across 2 instances. I notice the ROADMAP's GPU metrics are slightly outdated—scale_002 d1 shows 75% but I'm actually seeing 96.2% now, and westd-48862 is at 60.2% versus the ROADMAP's 57%. This is expected since the ROADMAP was last updated a few hours ago, so the numbers have naturally progressed. I'll go ahead and post the review.

[System 触发审查]:
**Final Polish 审查 + Claim 强度最大化评估**

论文当前状态：51/52 审稿 issue resolved，D039 全部 patch 完成，14B 在跑（ETA 5/19）。距 ARR May 25 还有 7 天。

请评估以下 3 点：

**1. 不依赖 14B 的段落打磨**
逐段检查论文正文（Abstract → Intro → Method → Atlas → Generalization → Discussion → Conclusion/Limitations），找出措辞可以更精确、论证可以更紧凑、或有 AI 写作痕迹残留的地方。重点关注：
- 是否还有解释性 em-dash（—）残留
- -ing 短语结尾
- "Furthermore/Moreover/Additionally" 连用
- 段落过度分段
- 数字与 registry 是否一致

**2. Claim 强度最大化**
基于当前 62 个成功实验的完整数据，评估：
- 有没有 underclaim 的地方？（数据支持更强的 claim 但论文说得太弱）
- Instruct 47.4% + Base 对比模式能否 claim 更强？
- LoRA loss 单调递减作为理论支撑是否被充分利用？
- prompted gen 69.5% 对 ecological validity 的论证是否足够突出？

**3. cuda:1 空闲——值得跑的额外 ablation？**
论文还差什么可以让审稿人挑不出毛病？考虑：
- 有没有 reviewer 可能问但我们没做的实验？
- 有没有能进一步加固现有 claim 的快速 ablation（<4h GPU time）？
- plan_026 GPT-4o-mini blocked 之外，有没有替代方案（如用 Gemini Flash API 做 API model 递归链）？

请具体给出 actionable 建议，标注 priority (must-do / nice-to-have) 和预计耗时。

Automated behaviors (\"from now on when X\", \"each time X\", \"whenever X\", \"before/after X\") require hooks configured in settings.json - the harness executes these, not Claude, so memory/preferences cannot fulfill them. Also use for: permissions (\"allow X\", \"add permission\", \"move permission to\"), env vars (\"set X=Y\"), hook troubleshooting, or any changes to settings.json/settings.local.json files. Examples: \"allow npm commands\", \"add bq permission to global settings\", \"move permission to user settings\", \"set DEBUG=true\", \"when claude stops show X\". For simple settings like theme/model, suggest the /config command.\n- keybindings-help: Use when the user wants to customize keyboard shortcuts, rebind keys, add chord bindings, or modify ~/.claude/keybindings.json. Examples: \"rebind ctrl+s\", \"add a chord shortcut\", \"change the submit key\", \"customize keybindings\".\n- simplify: Review changed code for reuse, quality, and efficiency, then fix any issues found.\n- fewer-permission-prompts: Scan your transcripts for common read-only Bash and MCP tool calls, then add a prioritized allowlist to project .claude/settings.json to reduce permission prompts.\n- loop: Run a prompt or slash command on a recurring interval (e.g. /loop 5m /foo). Omit the interval to let the model self-pace. - When the user wants to set up a recurring task, poll for status, or run something repeatedly on an interval (e.g. \"check the deploy every 5 minutes\", \"keep running /babysit-prs\"). Do NOT invoke for one-off tasks.\n- schedule: Create, update, list, or run scheduled remote agents (routines) that execute on a cron schedule. - When the user wants to schedule a recurring remote agent, set up automated tasks, create a cron job for Claude Code, or manage their scheduled agents/routines. Also use when the user wants a one-time scheduled run (\"run this once at 3pm\", \"remind me to check X tomorrow\").\n- claude-api: Build, debug, and optimize Claude API / Anthropic SDK apps.

This is a comprehensive review request with 3 parts. Let me systematically work through this:

1. Line-by-line polish of paper files (AI writing traces, number consistency, tightness)
2. Claim strength maximization assessment
3. cuda:1 idle GPU utilization suggestions

I need to read all paper files carefully. Let me start by reading them in parallel, plus the registry/results data for cross-checking numbers.

1	\section*{Limitations}
2	\label{sec:limitations}
3	
4	\paragraph{Cross-strategy deployment constraint.}
5	Cross-strategy transfer induces a d1/d2 boundary inversion under temperature sampling.
6	Per-strategy z-score normalization partially corrects the inversion under logistic regression (GPT-2~XL d1v2 AUC $0.24{\to}0.56$, OLMo $0.19{\to}0.70$) but yields negligible improvement for the Random Forest classifier used throughout the main experiments ($\Delta < 0.02$\,pp), and even in the best case (logistic regression) leaves a residual gap relative to within-strategy performance (${\sim}0.83$), indicating that a two-stage pipeline (strategy identification + strategy-conditioned classification) is needed for reliable cross-strategy deployment.
7	
8	\paragraph{Strategy-unknown deployment.}
9	In strategy-unknown settings, naive transfer on d1--d3 yields only 45.9\%, and d1/d2 predictions may invert.
10	A two-stage pipeline recovers 11.5\,pp over LOO, though per-model gains vary (GPT-2~XL $+$16.4\,pp vs.\ Pythia $+$8.0\,pp).
11	Practical deployment requires either strategy metadata or learned routing.
12	
13	\paragraph{d0 inflation of headline metrics.}
14	Depth~0 (human-written text) is near-perfectly separable (recall $>$98\% across all nine model--strategy settings), inflating headline accuracy.
15	Cross-model transfer accuracy of 66.4\% is substantially driven by d0; d2 recall drops to 26.8\% in the worst case (Pythia holdout).
16	
17	\paragraph{Controlled vs.\ ecological setting.}
18	The primary benchmark uses Wikipedia seed text with controlled LoRA fine-tuning (1--1.5B models), isolating the depth variable but diverging from wild contamination where models train on mixed corpora with prior-generation outputs at unknown proportions.
19	Domain bias controls confirm depth as the dominant factor: LOGO accuracy (72.1\%) matches standard CV (72.0\%), seed-group prediction is at chance (10.2\%; Appendix~\ref{app:domain_bias}).
20	Cross-scale experiments (7--8B, \S\ref{sec:gen:crossscale}) show weaker but above-chance signal; a base-model control suggests instruction-tuning regularizes degradation.
21	Segment-level estimation in mixed-depth documents remains open; in particular, partial mixing (accumulation), where a single document contains fragments from different recursive depths, is a key open question, as our framework assumes uniform depth per passage.
22	
23	\paragraph{Domain-dependent false positive rate.}
24	On editorial text (WikiText-103), all classifiers achieve $\geq$98.5\% d0 accuracy, but on web-crawl data (C4, 5{,}000 passages), per-model FPR ranges from 4.7\% (OLMo) to 22.4\% (GPT-2~XL).
25	A pooled RF classifier evaluated on larger corpora (10{,}000 passages each) yields 34\% FPR on C4 and 17\% on FineWeb; the gap reflects quality filtering in FineWeb removing feature-anomalous text that triggers false positives.
26	Misclassifications concentrate in template/SEO content with elevated repetition features (\texttt{rep\_3gram} $+$37\%, \texttt{rep\_4gram} $+$75\% vs.\ correctly classified d0).
27	Deployment on heterogeneous web corpora requires model- and domain-specific calibration.
28	
29	\paragraph{Adversarial robustness.}
30	Adversarial paraphrasing \cite{sadasivan2023_paraphrase} could disrupt the perplexity tail features that drive classification; depth estimation's robustness under such attacks is untested.
31	
32	\paragraph{EDD monotonicity assumption.}
33	Our EDD definition (Eq.~\ref{eq:edd}) requires all pairwise AUCs up to depth $d^*$ to exceed $T$, which is well-behaved when AUC decays monotonically, as observed in all our configurations.
34	However, \citet{bakshi2026_collapse_improvement} show that early recursion can temporarily \emph{improve} model quality, which could produce non-monotonic AUC profiles (e.g., a dip at d1/d2 followed by recovery at d2/d3).
35	Our cross-strategy transfer results provide an empirical example: training on nucleus + top-$k$ and testing on temperature yields d1-vs-d2 AUC as low as 0.129 (GPT-2~XL) and 0.253 (OLMo), violating the monotonicity assumption.
36	In such cases EDD would conservatively report a lower value than the deepest discriminable pair, potentially underestimating the true discriminable range; extending EDD to handle non-contiguous discriminable regions is future work.
37	The choice of threshold $T$ is also application-dependent: at $T{=}0.80$, several cells lose one depth level relative to $T{=}0.75$.
38	
39	\paragraph{Reference model dependency.}
40	Reference model choice affects classification accuracy by up to 11\,pp; same-family references yield optimal performance, though all configurations exceed $2.5\times$ chance.
41	Surprisal-based features are computed relative to Pythia-1.4B, which coincides with one of the three generators.
42	For the Pythia pipeline this constitutes self-model feature extraction, while OLMo and GPT-2~XL measurements are cross-model.
43	Empirically, the self-model configuration does not yield the highest accuracy (Pythia 78.7\% vs.\ GPT-2~XL 85.9\%), suggesting the overlap does not confer a systematic advantage.
44	An ablation with OLMo-1B and GPT-2 XL as alternative references shows accuracy ranging from 67--79\% across three reference architectures (Appendix~\ref{app:ref_ablation}), all exceeding $2.5\times$ chance; same-family reference yields optimal performance ($\Delta{\leq}$11\,pp).
45	The choice of reference model affects feature values; a different reference model may shift absolute feature magnitudes and potentially alter discriminability at depth boundaries.
46	Reference-free surface features alone achieve 53.7\% (confirming partial signal in lexical statistics) but 25pp below the full pipeline, underscoring that surprisal-based features are essential.
47	Simple multi-reference ensembling does not outperform the best single reference (73.7\% vs.\ 78.6\%).
48	
49	\paragraph{Single LoRA instance.}
50	Independent replication with seed=43 yields 77.15\% (95\% CI [76.4, 78.15], $\Delta{=}{-}1.05$\,pp vs.\ baseline); cross-seed transfer retains 76.76\% ($\Delta{=}{-}1.30$\,pp vs.\ within-seed avg), confirming depth signal is inherent to the recursive process rather than specific LoRA weights (Appendix~\ref{app:seed_replication}).
51	Top-5 feature importance is identical across seeds.
52	
53	\paragraph{Additional caveats.}
54	Depth signal scales with passage length (68.4\% at 128 tokens, 77.8\% at 512; Appendix~\ref{app:length_ablation}), saturating near 500 tokens.
55	Detection features degrade under domain shift \cite{pudasaini2026_detection_fails}, and curated synthetic data may not trigger collapse \cite{falahati2026_curated}, attenuating the fingerprints we exploit.
56	
57	\section*{Ethics Statement}
58	
59	This work uses publicly available pretrained language models (Pythia-1.4B, OLMo-1B, GPT-2~XL) and Wikipedia text as seed data.
60	No human subjects were involved, no private or sensitive data were collected, and no new models were released.
61	Our method is intended to support data provenance and training-data auditing; we acknowledge that depth estimation tools could in principle be misused to circumvent content moderation, though such risks are shared with all detection-oriented research.
62	Code and data will be released upon acceptance.

2	As large language models increasingly train on web text containing their own outputs, a recursive model$\to$data$\to$model loop arises, yet no method estimates how many such iterations a text has undergone.
3	We formalize \emph{recursive generation depth estimation} as ordinal classification and construct a benchmark of 180K passages spanning 3 model families, 3 decoding strategies, and 4 generation depths.
4	A Random Forest over 19 perplexity-based features achieves $\approx$69--86\% four-class accuracy (chance = 25\%), with perplexity tail statistics emerging as consistent depth markers; a parsimonious subset of 5 features retains 97.6\% of full performance.
5	We define the \emph{Effective Discriminable Depth} (EDD) metric, finding $\mathrm{EDD}_{0.75}{=}4$ for the best-characterized family, and show that cross-model transfer reaches 66.4\% (2.7$\times$ chance).
6	Systematic generalization across eight axes (e.g., cross-scale with 7B models at 70.2\%, prompted generation at 69.5\%, cross-domain, and LoRA-rank ablation) confirms that depth signal is robust across model families but strategy-dependent, residing in distributional statistics inaccessible from surface text (zero-shot LLMs: 30--36\%, 43\,pp below RF).

1	\section{Introduction}
2	\label{sec:intro}
3	
4	The text on which large language models are trained increasingly contains their own outputs.
5	As synthetic content proliferates across the web, a recursive loop emerges: models trained on web corpora ingest text generated by earlier models, and their outputs feed into the next generation's training data \cite{shumailov2024_nature,alemohammad2024_mad}.
6	This model$\to$data$\to$model cycle is no longer hypothetical; it is already occurring in the wild. Yet we lack the ability to determine how many recursive iterations a given text has undergone, a distinction that matters because first-generation synthetic text may be benign or even beneficial for training, while deeply recursive text drives the distributional collapse that degrades model quality \cite{dohmatob2024_tale_of_tails}.
7	
8	Existing tools address adjacent but distinct problems.
9	Binary detectors such as Binoculars \cite{binoculars2024}, Fast-DetectGPT \cite{fast_detectgpt2024}, and DivEye \cite{diveye2026} classify text as human-written or machine-generated, collapsing all depths $d \geq 1$ into a single category.
10	Watermarking \cite{kirchenbauer2023_watermark} requires proactive embedding and cannot be applied retroactively.
11	The model collapse literature \cite{shumailov2024_nature,dohmatob2024_tale_of_tails} assumes depth is known a priori; \citet{drayson2025_detection_prevents_collapse} filter synthetic data via binary detection without distinguishing depths.
12	No existing method estimates the ordinal recursive generation depth of a text passage from its content alone.
13	
14	We find that recursive generation leaves quantifiable statistical fingerprints in text, and these fingerprints are \textbf{consistent in direction but scale-dependent in magnitude} across the three model families and three decoding strategies studied.
15	Specifically, perplexity tail statistics (the 90th-percentile perplexity, \textsc{p90\_ppl}, and surprisal variance, \textsc{var\_surprisal}) emerge as dominant depth indicators, ranking in the top two features by importance in 9/9 and 8/9 model--strategy configurations, respectively.
16	Instruction-tuned variants exhibit monotonically decreasing AUC (regularization), whereas base models can show non-monotonic trajectories, suggesting that instruction tuning acts as a regularizer on the depth signal rather than introducing degradation.
17	
18	We formalize recursive generation depth estimation as ordinal classification and introduce a lightweight pipeline: compute 19 reference-model perplexity features (effective dimensionality ${\approx}$4--5 due to multicollinearity; \S\ref{sec:atlas:features}) and classify with a Random Forest into $K{+}1$ depth classes.
19	To characterize how recursive generation reshapes these features, we construct the \emph{Depth Degradation Atlas}: a $3 \times 3$ grid of model families $\times$ decoding strategies spanning 4 depths (180K samples).
20	The atlas reveals strategy-dependent degradation trajectories and we introduce the \emph{Effective Discriminable Depth} (EDD) metric to quantify how far into the recursion chain adjacent depths remain distinguishable.
21	
22	Our contributions are:
23	\begin{itemize}
24	    \item \textbf{Task formalization and benchmark.} We define recursive generation depth estimation as ordinal classification, introduce the EDD metric, and construct a 180K-sample benchmark spanning 3 model families $\times$ 3 decoding strategies $\times$ 4 depths.
25	
26	    \item \textbf{Depth Degradation Atlas.} A systematic $3 \times 3$ characterization reveals that perplexity tail statistics dominate depth discrimination (top-2 in 9/9 and 8/9 cells), decoding strategy reshapes degradation trajectories qualitatively, and $\mathrm{EDD}_{0.75}{=}4$ for the best-characterized family (Pythia, $p{=}0.001$); all three families cross the $T{=}0.75$ threshold within the d3--d4 region, with graded statistical confidence ($p{=}0.091$ for OLMo, $p{=}0.505$ for GPT-2~XL).
27	
28	    \item \textbf{Transfer generalization.} Cross-model LOO (66.4\%), cross-strategy (59.1\%), cross-seed (76.8\%), prompted generation (69.5\%), and recursive chains (84.75\%).
29	
30	    \item \textbf{Scale and domain robustness.} Cross-scale 7--8B (70.2\%, 60.1\%), cross-domain arXiv (74.1\%), temperature ($\tau \in [0.5, 0.9]$).
31	
32	    \item \textbf{Diagnostic ablations.} LoRA rank spread 4.65\,pp, three reference architectures (67--79\%), generation length scaling, and surface-text control (zero-shot LLMs at 30--36\%, 43\,pp below RF) confirming the signal resides in distributional statistics; 19 features and a Random Forest suffice for GPU-free inference.
33	\end{itemize}

```text
1	\section{Method}
2	\label{sec:method}
3	
4	\subsection{Problem Definition}
5	\label{sec:method:problem}
6	
7	Let $f_\theta$ denote a language model and $\mathcal{D}_0$ a corpus of human-written seed text.
8	We define a \emph{recursive generation chain} of depth $K$ as the sequence $\mathcal{D}_0, \mathcal{D}_1, \dots, \mathcal{D}_K$, where each $\mathcal{D}_k$ ($k \geq 1$) is produced by finetuning $f_\theta$ on $\mathcal{D}_{k-1}$ and sampling from the resulting model.
9	Depth $d{=}0$ denotes human-written text; depth $d{=}k$ ($k \geq 1$) denotes text generated by a model trained on depth-$(k{-}1)$ data.
10	
11	Given a text passage $x$, the task is to estimate its recursive generation depth $d \in \{0, 1, \dots, K\}$.
12	This is an ordinal classification problem: depths carry a natural ordering, and $d{=}1$ is structurally closer to $d{=}0$ than $d{=}3$ is, since each generation step compounds distributional drift.
13	
14	\subsection{Multi-Generational Benchmark Construction}
15	\label{sec:method:benchmark}
16	
17	We construct a benchmark spanning three axes: model family, decoding strategy, and generation depth.
18	
19	\paragraph{Model families.}
20	We select three 1--1.5B-parameter models with diverse pretraining corpora and architectures: Pythia-1.4B (EleutherAI), OLMo-1B (AI2), and GPT-2~XL (OpenAI, 1.5B).
21	Restricting to a narrow parameter range isolates the effect of architecture and training data from scale.
22	
23	\paragraph{Decoding strategies.}
24	Each model is paired with three decoding strategies: nucleus sampling ($p{=}0.95$) \cite{holtzman2020_nucleus}, temperature sampling ($\tau{=}0.9$), and top-$k$ sampling ($k{=}50$).
25	These span the dominant modes of open-ended generation and induce qualitatively different entropy profiles.
26	Our findings on feature importance and discriminability are limited to this grid; transfer to untested models, scales, or strategies is not established.
27	
28	\paragraph{Depth and scale.}
29	The primary benchmark covers depths d0--d3 across all $3 \times 3 = 9$ model--strategy cells, with 5{,}000 samples per depth per cell (180K samples total).
30	For depth extension experiments (\S\ref{sec:atlas}), we extend one pipeline (Pythia-1.4B, nucleus) to d0--d5.
31	
32	\paragraph{Generation pipeline.}
33	Starting from a Wikipedia subset as seed text ($\mathcal{D}_0$), each generation cycle proceeds in three steps: (1)~LoRA finetuning \cite{hu2022lora} on $\mathcal{D}_{k-1}$, freezing base model weights and training low-rank update matrices ($<$1\% additional parameters; $r{=}16$, $\alpha{=}32$, lr $2{\times}10^{-4}$, batch size 8, 3 epochs, dropout $0.05$, architecture-specific targets); (2)~sampling 5{,}000 passages from the LoRA-finetuned model (max 512 tokens, BOS-seeded, no prompt conditioning) under the specified decoding strategy; (3)~the generated corpus becomes $\mathcal{D}_k$ for the next cycle.
34	Each depth is produced by a model explicitly trained on the prior depth's data, not by sampling from the unmodified base model.
35	Our BOS-seeded generation may amplify depth signal relative to prompted settings; a prompted-generation validation (\S\ref{sec:gen:crossstrategy}) confirms signal persistence under topic-seeded conditions ($-$13.8\,pp vs.\ BOS-seeded).
36	There is no per-passage lineage across depths, ensuring cross-validation splits do not introduce information leakage.
37	
38	\paragraph{Reference model.}
39	All statistical features (\S\ref{sec:method:features}) are computed using Pythia-1.4B as fixed reference model, the smallest generator whose training corpus partially overlaps with the others.
40	For Pythia this constitutes self-model measurement, yet its accuracy (78.7\%) does not exceed GPT-2~XL (85.9\%), indicating no systematic self-model advantage.
41	Ablations with OLMo-1B and GPT-2 XL as alternative references yield 67--79\% accuracy (Appendix~\ref{app:ref_ablation}), confirming reference model robustness; further discussion in Limitations.
42	
43	\subsection{Statistical Feature Design}
44	\label{sec:method:features}
45	
46	We extract a feature vector $\mathbf{f}(x)$ comprising 19 candidate features from the reference-model perplexity distribution over each passage $x$; ablation (\S\ref{sec:atlas:features}) shows the top 5 achieve 97.6\% of full-set performance, and variance inflation analysis reveals VIF${>}$10 for 14--16 features, placing the effective independent dimensionality at ${\approx}$4--5.
47	The features fall into four categories (Table~\ref{tab:features}).
48	
49	\begin{table}[t]
50	\centering
51	\small
52	\caption{The 19 statistical features comprising $\mathbf{f}(x)$, grouped by category. All perplexity and surprisal features are computed from the reference model (Pythia-1.4B).}
53	\label{tab:features}
54	\begin{tabular}{@{}llr@{}}
55	\toprule
56	Category & Features & $n$ \\
57	\midrule
58	Perplexity & mean, var, skewness, kurtosis, & 9 \\
59	statistics & p10, p25, p50, p75, p90 & \\
60	\addlinespace
61	Surprisal & mean, var, entropy & 3 \\
62	statistics & & \\
63	\addlinespace
64	Lexical & type--token ratio, hapax ratio, & 4 \\
65	diversity & bigram entropy, trigram entropy & \\
66	\addlinespace
67	Repetition & repeated 2/3/4-gram fractions & 3 \\
68	\bottomrule
69	\end{tabular}
70	\end{table}
71	
72	\emph{Perplexity statistics} (9 features) capture the per-token perplexity distribution via moments (mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis) and quantiles (p10--p90); tail quantiles prove especially informative as recursive finetuning erodes the high-perplexity tail (\S\ref{sec:atlas}).
73	\emph{Surprisal statistics} (3 features): mean, variance, and entropy of $-\log p(\text{token})$; surprisal variance captures second-order structure not redundant with perplexity moments.
74	\emph{Lexical diversity} (4 features): type--token ratio, hapax ratio, bigram/trigram entropy.
75	\emph{Repetition} (3 features): repeated $n$-gram fractions for $n \in \{2, 3, 4\}$.
76	
77	\subsection{Effective Discriminable Depth}
78	\label{sec:method:edd}
79	
80	Aggregate multi-class accuracy obscures whether discriminability degrades at specific depth boundaries.
81	We propose the \emph{Effective Discriminable Depth} (EDD) as an operational measure of how far into a recursive chain adjacent depths remain distinguishable.
82	
83	\paragraph{Pairwise discriminability.}
84	Let $\mathcal{D} = \{0, 1, \dots, K\}$ denote the depth set and $T \in (0.5, 1.0]$ a discrimination threshold.
85	For each adjacent pair $(d, d{+}1)$, we define the pairwise discriminability $\mathrm{AUC}(d, d{+}1)$ as the area under the ROC curve of a dedicated binary Random Forest classifier (500 trees, $\lfloor\sqrt{19}\rfloor$ candidate features per split) trained on class-balanced data from $\mathbf{f}(x)$ (\S\ref{sec:method:features}) to distinguish depth-$d$ from depth-$(d{+}1)$ samples, evaluated via 5-fold stratified cross-validation.
86	Each pair uses an independent classifier, avoiding the decision boundary dilution that arises in multi-class settings (\S\ref{sec:atlas:edd}).
87	
88	\begin{definition}[Effective Discriminable Depth]
89	\label{def:edd}
90	The \emph{Effective Discriminable Depth} at threshold $T$ is:
91	\begin{equation}
92	\mathrm{EDD}_T = \max \bigl\{ d^*{+}1 \,:\, \forall\, d' \leq d^*,\; \mathrm{AUC}(d', d'{+}1) \geq T \bigr\}
93	\label{eq:edd}
94	\end{equation}
95	where $d^* \in \{0, \dots, K{-}1\}$. If\, $\mathrm{AUC}(0,1) < T$, then $\mathrm{EDD}_T = 0$.
96	\end{definition}
97	
98	$\mathrm{EDD}_T$ is the deepest depth $d$ such that every adjacent pair from $(0,1)$ through $(d{-}1, d)$ remains discriminable at level $T$.
99	The universal quantifier ensures EDD reports the longest \emph{contiguous} discriminable prefix rather than an isolated high-AUC pair at greater depth.\footnote{Our AUC profiles are empirically monotonically decreasing for the 1--1.5B base models (\S\ref{sec:atlas}), so in practice $\mathrm{EDD}_T = \max\{d'{+}1 : \mathrm{AUC}(d', d'{+}1) \geq T\}$. Qwen2.5-7B exhibits a U-shaped AUC pattern rather than monotonic decay; a base-model control shows non-monotonic decay persists without instruction tuning (\S\ref{sec:gen:crossscale}). For non-monotonic profiles, the contiguous formulation is more conservative (see Limitations).}
100	We set $T{=}0.75$ as default; sensitivity at $T \in \{0.65, 0.70, 0.75, 0.80\}$ is reported in \S\ref{sec:atlas}.
101	
102	\paragraph{Classifiers.}
103	Our primary classifier is a Random Forest (200 trees, unconstrained depth, 5-fold stratified cross-validation).
104	We compare against CORAL ordinal regression \cite{coral2020}, DivEye \cite{diveye2026}, a 2-layer cross-entropy MLP, logistic regression, and a single-feature baseline using mean perplexity alone; results appear in \S\ref{sec:generalization}.

If\\, $\\mathrm{AUC}(0,1) < T$, then $\\mathrm{EDD}_T = 0$.\n\\end{definition}\n\n$\\mathrm{EDD}_T$ is the deepest depth $d$ such that every adjacent pair from $(0,1)$ through $(d{-}1, d)$ remains discriminable at level $T$.\nThe universal quantifier ensures EDD reports the longest \\emph{contiguous} discriminable prefix rather than an isolated high-AUC pair at greater depth.\\footnote{Our AUC profiles are empirically monotonically decreasing for the 1--1.5B base models (\\S\\ref{sec:atlas}), so in practice $\\mathrm{EDD}_T = \\max\\{d'{+}1 : \\mathrm{AUC}(d', d'{+}1) \\geq T\\}$. Qwen2.5-7B exhibits a U-shaped AUC pattern rather than monotonic decay; a base-model control shows non-monotonic decay persists without instruction tuning (\\S\\ref{sec:gen:crossscale}). For non-monotonic profiles, the contiguous formulation is more conservative (see Limitations).}\nWe set $T{=}0.75$ as default; sensitivity at $T \\in \\{0.65, 0.70, 0.75, 0.80\\}$ is reported in \\S\\ref{sec:atlas}.\n\n\\paragraph{Classifiers.}\nOur primary classifier is a Random Forest (200 trees, unconstrained depth, 5-fold stratified cross-validation).\nWe compare against CORAL ordinal regression \\cite{coral2020}, DivEye \\cite{diveye2026}, a 2-layer cross-entropy MLP, logistic regression, and a single-feature baseline using mean perplexity alone; results appear in \\S\\ref{sec:generalization}.",

1	\section{The Depth Degradation Atlas}
2	\label{sec:atlas}
3	
4	We present the Depth Degradation Atlas: a systematic empirical map of how statistical fingerprints evolve across recursive generation depths, models, and decoding strategies.
5	The atlas spans $3 \times 3 = 9$ model--strategy cells evaluated at depths $d \in \{0, 1, 2, 3\}$, with depth extensions to $d{=}5$ for cross-model EDD validation (\S\ref{sec:atlas:edd}).
6	
7	%% ----------------------------------------------------------------
8	\subsection{In-Distribution Performance}
9	\label{sec:atlas:id}
10	
11	Table~\ref{tab:main_matrix} reports four-class Random Forest accuracy (5-fold CV, 200 trees) across all nine cells.
12	Accuracy ranges from 68.8\% (Pythia, top-$k$) to 85.9\% (GPT-2~XL, temperature), all exceeding the 25\% chance baseline by a wide margin.
13	Two axis effects emerge.
14	GPT-2~XL achieves the highest accuracy under every strategy (75.9--85.9\%), followed by OLMo (74.5--82.1\%) and Pythia (68.8--78.7\%).
15	Top-$k$ sampling yields the lowest accuracy in every model.
16	The mean within-model strategy gap is 9.2~pp, comparable to the 7.2~pp mean within-strategy model gap; decoding strategy and model family contribute roughly equally to performance variance.
17	
18	\begin{table}[t]
19	\centering
20	\small
21	\caption{Four-class RF accuracy (\%) with bootstrap 95\% CI (${\pm}$half-width; 10{,}000 resamples) across the $3 \times 3$ atlas; d1--d3 three-class accuracy in parentheses (chance = 25\% / 33\%). Depth-0 recall exceeds 98\% in all cells.}
22	\label{tab:main_matrix}
23	\begin{tabular}{@{}lccc@{}}
24	\toprule
25	& Nucleus & Temp.\ $\tau{=}0.9$ & Top-$k$ \\
26	\midrule
27	Pythia-1.4B  & 78.7{\scriptsize$\pm$0.5}\,(71.2) & 76.7{\scriptsize$\pm$0.5}\,(70.6) & 68.8{\scriptsize$\pm$0.6}\,(58.8) \\
28	OLMo-1B     & 78.9{\scriptsize$\pm$0.5}\,(75.0) & 82.1{\scriptsize$\pm$0.5}\,(76.3) & 74.5{\scriptsize$\pm$0.5}\,(66.1) \\
29	GPT-2~XL    & \textbf{84.1}{\scriptsize$\pm$0.5}\,(79.0) & \textbf{85.9}{\scriptsize$\pm$0.5}\,(82.6) & \textbf{75.9}{\scriptsize$\pm$0.6}\,(69.5) \\
30	\bottomrule
31	\end{tabular}
32	\end{table}
33	
34	\paragraph{Per-class recall distribution.}
35	Depth-0 recall exceeds 98\% in all 9 cells, confirming that human-written text is trivially separable from any generation depth.
36	Among generated depths, d2 consistently yields the lowest recall (46--73\% across cells), followed by d3 (58--82\%) and d1 (72--91\%).
37	For example, Pythia-1.4B nucleus achieves per-class recall of d0$\,{=}\,$99\%, d1$\,{=}\,$82\%, d2$\,{=}\,$59\%, d3$\,{=}\,$72\%.
38	The strongest d2 recall is obtained by GPT-2~XL nucleus (73\%).
39	The d2 trough reflects its position at the center of the depth gradient: d2 features overlap with both the d1 distribution above and d3 below, making it the most confusable class, consistent with the d2-vs-d3 pair being the EDD bottleneck (\S\ref{sec:atlas:edd}).
40	Full per-class recall for all cells appears in Appendix~\ref{app:per_class}.
41	
42	%% ----------------------------------------------------------------
43	\subsection{Feature Consistency Across the Grid}
44	\label{sec:atlas:features}
45	
46	Despite the 17.1~pp accuracy spread across cells, a small feature family dominates in every setting.
47	Perplexity tail statistics as a feature group dominate depth discrimination: the 90th-percentile perplexity (\texttt{p90\_ppl}) ranks top-2 by Gini importance in all 9 cells; surprisal variance (\texttt{var\_surprisal}) in 8/9 under SHAP (7/9 under Gini; Appendix~\ref{app:permutation}).\footnote{Individual feature rankings should be interpreted cautiously given high multicollinearity (VIF${>}$10 for 14--16/19 features); the group-level dominance of perplexity tail statistics is robust across importance measures.}
48	Table~\ref{tab:feature_importance} shows the full per-cell ranking.
49	
50	Cross-model feature-rank Spearman correlation averages $\bar{\rho} = 0.868$ (range $[0.619, 0.954]$): models agree on which features carry depth information even when they differ in absolute accuracy.
51	Among strategies, top-$k$ yields the highest cross-model rank correlation ($\rho = 0.811$): the deterministic vocabulary truncation imposes a more uniform feature landscape across architectures, at the cost of weaker overall signal (\S\ref{sec:atlas:strategy}).
52	
53	Percentile-based features outperform their moment-based counterparts.
54	Token-level perplexity distributions are heavy-tailed: individual outlier passages can dominate the arithmetic mean of their depth class, whereas \texttt{p90\_ppl} is robust to such extremes while still capturing the tail erosion that signals generation depth.
55	
56	Feature ablation confirms this concentration: the top-2 features (\texttt{p90\_ppl} + \texttt{var\_surprisal}) alone reach 91.1\% of full accuracy (71.5\%), and the top-5 features achieve 97.6\% (76.5\% vs.\ 78.4\%), with perplexity statistics alone reaching 76.6\% (vs.\ surprisal 73.2\%, other categories ${\leq}$47\%).
57	Variance inflation analysis reveals VIF${>}$10 for 14--16 of 19 features, placing the effective independent dimensionality at ${\approx}$4--5.
58	Forward selection independently confirms the dominant pair: \texttt{p90\_ppl} is selected first in 6/9 cells, \texttt{var\_surprisal} in 3/9.
59	
60	The feature hierarchy also shifts with depth.
61	At shallow boundaries (d1 vs.\ d2), \texttt{var\_surprisal} dominates importance; at deeper boundaries (d3 vs.\ d4, d4 vs.\ d5), tail perplexity statistics (\texttt{p90\_ppl}, \texttt{kurtosis\_ppl}) take over.
62	This transition aligns with model-collapse dynamics~\cite{shumailov2024_nature}: early recursion narrows the surprisal distribution (captured by its variance), while later steps erode the perplexity tail (captured by upper quantiles and kurtosis).

95	\subsection{Monotonicity and Inter-Depth Distances}
96	\label{sec:atlas:monotonicity}
97	
98	Depth features exhibit strong monotonic trends: perplexity tail statistics (\texttt{p90\_ppl}, \texttt{mean\_surprisal}) decrease with depth (Spearman $\rho = -1.0$ across cell-level medians) while repetition features increase, reflecting the complementary narrowing and self-repetition of distribution collapse.
99	Inter-depth distances are non-uniform: d0-vs-d1 AUC exceeds 0.99 in all 9 cells, whereas d2-vs-d3 ranges from 0.69 to 0.89; separating adjacent deep generations requires the tail statistics identified in \S\ref{sec:atlas:features}.

109	\subsection{EDD Analysis}
110	\label{sec:atlas:edd}
111	
112	We extend the benchmark to depth $d{=}5$ for all three models under nucleus sampling.
113	Each model's depth-3 LoRA checkpoint is used to finetune and generate depth-4 data, and the process repeats for depth~5; feature extraction uses the same reference model (Pythia-1.4B).
114	We train dedicated binary RF classifiers (500 trees) for each adjacent pair, as defined in Eq.~\ref{eq:edd}.
115	
116	\paragraph{AUC decay profile.}
117	Figure~\ref{fig:auc_decay} plots the binary pairwise AUC decay curves.
118	For Pythia-1.4B (nucleus), AUC decays monotonically: d0-vs-d1 $= 0.999$, d1-vs-d2 $= 0.925$, d2-vs-d3 $= 0.823$, d3-vs-d4 $= 0.784$, d4-vs-d5 $= 0.683$.
119	The steepest drop occurs between the d1-vs-d2 and d2-vs-d3 pairs; the curve then flattens as the system approaches an indistinguishable regime gradually rather than crossing a sharp boundary.
120	
121	\paragraph{AUC-excess contraction.}
122	The AUC-excess ($\mathrm{AUC} - 0.5$) contracts across successive depth pairs.
123	For the three-model mean profile (excess values $0.453, 0.362, 0.266, 0.183$ for pairs d1v2 through d4v5), the contraction ratio decreases from 0.80 to 0.69, indicating accelerating convergence toward indistinguishability.
124	Per-model variation is larger (Pythia: 0.64--0.88), reflecting model-specific saturation rates.
125	This non-uniform contraction motivates the EDD metric (Eq.~\ref{eq:edd}): a depth threshold beyond which pairwise AUC falls below a practical detection limit.
126	
127	\paragraph{Cross-model convergence at depth 4--5.}
128	The d3-vs-d4 AUC consistently clusters near the $T{=}0.75$ threshold across all three models (Pythia $0.784$, OLMo $0.765$, GPT-2~XL $0.750$), while d4-vs-d5 uniformly falls below $0.70$ ($0.681$--$0.684$).
129	The directional pattern is consistent, but statistical strength is stratified: bootstrap testing ($10{,}000$ resamples, $H_0{:}\, \mathrm{AUC} \leq 0.75$) yields $p = 0.001$ for Pythia (significant), $p = 0.091$ for OLMo (marginal), and $p = 0.505$ for GPT-2~XL (non-significant).
130	All three models cross the $T{=}0.75$ threshold within the d3--d4 region, establishing a consistent depth-4 decay boundary with graded confidence rather than uniform statistical significance.
131	The d4-vs-d5 saturation is unambiguous across models, supporting the interpretation of d3--d4 as a \emph{transition zone} from discriminable to indistinguishable regime.
132	
133	\paragraph{EDD threshold sensitivity.}
134	Table~\ref{tab:edd_sensitivity} reports $\mathrm{EDD}_T$ across the primary 9-cell benchmark (depths 0--3) at four threshold values.
135	At $T{=}0.65$, all 9 cells achieve $\mathrm{EDD} = 3$; at $T{=}0.75$, 7 of 9 cells maintain $\mathrm{EDD} \geq 3$; at $T{=}0.80$, the count drops to 5 of 9.
136	The cells losing $\mathrm{EDD}{=}3$ first are consistently the top-$k$ configurations (Pythia top-$k$ at $T{=}0.70$, then OLMo top-$k$ at $T{=}0.75$), where the d2-vs-d3 pair is the consistent bottleneck across all 9 cells.

159	\paragraph{Decision boundary dilution.}
160	\label{sec:atlas:edd:dilution}
161	EDD uses binary-pair classifiers to avoid \emph{decision boundary dilution}: in Pythia nucleus, d2\,vs.\,d3 AUC degrades from 0.804 (4-class) to 0.689 (6-class), a 14.3\% relative decline despite identical data, because shared decision boundaries dilute per-pair capacity.
162	Binary classifiers eliminate this confound, isolating true adjacent-pair discriminability.
163	
164	%% ----------------------------------------------------------------
165	\subsection{Strategy-Dependent Trajectories}
166	\label{sec:atlas:strategy}
167	
168	The three decoding strategies induce qualitatively distinct degradation trajectories.
169	Nucleus ($p{=}0.95$) produces the most consistent accuracy (78.7--84.1\%) and serves as the reference trajectory.
170	Temperature ($\tau{=}0.9$) yields the highest accuracy in 2/3 models (GPT-2~XL 85.9\%, OLMo 82.1\%) because uniform logit scaling accelerates convergence to an attractor distribution~\cite{shumailov2024_nature}, amplifying the statistical fingerprint. However, this acceleration creates a boundary reversal risk: temperature depth-$N$ features approximate nucleus/top-$k$ depth-$(N{+}1)$ features, causing cross-strategy classifiers to systematically overpredict depth (\S\ref{sec:generalization}).
171	Top-$k$ ($k{=}50$) produces the lowest accuracy (68.8--75.9\%) because hard vocabulary truncation removes depth-discriminative low-probability tokens, though feature direction is preserved (cross-model $\rho = 0.811$).
172	The strategy effect (9.2~pp range) exceeds the model effect (7.2~pp), indicating deployment-time knowledge of the decoding strategy matters at least as much as the generator model.

surprisal variance (\\texttt{var\\_surprisal}) in 8/9 under SHAP (7/9 under Gini; Appendix~\\ref{app:permutation}).\\footnote{Individual feature rankings should be interpreted cautiously given high multicollinearity (VIF${>}$10 for 14--16/19 features); the group-level dominance of perplexity tail statistics is robust across importance measures.}\nTable~\\ref{tab:feature_importance} shows the full per-cell ranking.\n\nCross-model feature-rank Spearman correlation averages $\\bar{\\rho} = 0.868$ (range $[0.619, 0.954]$): models agree on which features carry depth information even when they differ in absolute accuracy.\nAmong strategies, top-$k$ yields the highest cross-model rank correlation ($\\rho = 0.811$): the deterministic vocabulary truncation imposes a more uniform feature landscape across architectures, at the cost of weaker overall signal (\\S\\ref{sec:atlas:strategy}).\n\nPercentile-based features outperform their moment-based counterparts.\nToken-level perplexity distributions are heavy-tailed: individual outlier passages can dominate the arithmetic mean of their depth class, whereas \\texttt{p90\\_ppl} is robust to such extremes while still capturing the tail erosion that signals generation depth.\n\nFeature ablation confirms this concentration: the top-2 features (\\texttt{p90\\_ppl} + \\texttt{var\\_surprisal}) alone reach 91.1\\% of full accuracy (71.5\\%), and the top-5 features achieve 97.6\\% (76.5\\% vs.\\ 78.4\\%), with perplexity statistics alone reaching 76.6\\% (vs.\\ surprisal 73.2\\%, other categories ${\\leq}$47\\%).\nVariance inflation analysis reveals VIF${>}$10 for 14--16 of 19 features, placing the effective independent dimensionality at ${\\approx}$4--5.\nForward selection independently confirms the dominant pair: \\texttt{p90\\_ppl} is selected first in 6/9 cells, \\texttt{var\\_surprisal} in 3/9.\n\nThe feature hierarchy also shifts with depth.\nAt shallow boundaries (d1 vs.\\ d2), \\texttt{var\\_surprisal} dominates importance; at deeper boundaries (d3 vs.\\ d4, d4 vs.\\ d5), tail perplexity statistics (\\texttt{p90\\_ppl}, \\texttt{kurtosis\\_ppl}) take over.\nThis transition aligns with model-collapse dynamics~\\cite{shumailov2024_nature}: early recursion narrows the surprisal distribution (captured by its variance), while later steps erode the perplexity tail (captured by upper quantiles and kurtosis).\n\n\\begin{table}[t]\n\\centering\n\\small\n\\caption{Top-5 features by Gini importance. \\textbf{Bold}: top-2. \\texttt{p90\\_ppl} top-2 in 9/9;

4	We test whether atlas accuracy (68.8--85.9\%) reflects genuine statistical regularities across seven generalization axes (four below, three in Appendix).
5	
6	\subsection{Classifier Comparison and Surface-Text Ablation}
7	\label{sec:gen:baselines}
8	
9	Table~\ref{tab:baselines} evaluates bagging (RF) and gradient boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM) on the same 19 features; per-cell spread is $\leq$0.4pp, establishing a feature-determined ceiling.
10	On Pythia nucleus, CORAL ordinal regression \cite{coral2020} (78.1\%) and DivEye \cite{diveye2026} (78.2\%) match within-cell RF within 0.6\,pp ($p>0.05$, Bonferroni-corrected); all feature-based methods outperform CE-MLP (74.9\%, $p<0.001$) and logistic regression (75.0\%).
11	Binary detectors repurposed for ordinal classification (Binoculars + Fast-DetectGPT combined: 74.2\%) fall 4\,pp below RF (Appendix~\ref{app:detector_baselines}).
12	
13	\paragraph{Surface-text ablation.}
14	Single-feature regression on mean perplexity performs at chance (25.1\%); zero-shot LLMs (DeepSeek V3.2, 36.2\%; Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, 30.4\%) also fail (43\,pp below RF; Appendix~\ref{app:zeroshot_prompt}), confirming depth signal resides in distributional statistics inaccessible from surface text.
15	
16	\begin{table}[t]
17	\centering
18	\small
19	\caption{Classifier convergence: 4-class accuracy (\%) across three atlas cells. RF (bagging), XGBoost and LightGBM (gradient boosting) operate on the same 19 features; $\Delta_{\max}$: largest per-cell spread. Chance = 25\%. RF values differ from Table~\ref{tab:main_matrix} by $\leq$0.2pp due to matched-fold evaluation. 5-fold cross-validation standard deviation $\leq$ 0.9\,pp across all settings.}
20	\label{tab:baselines}
21	\begin{tabular}{@{}lcccc@{}}

23	Cell & RF & XGB & LGBM & $\Delta_{\max}$ \\
24	\midrule
25	Pythia, nuc. & 78.8 & 79.0 & 78.9 & 0.2 \\
26	GPT-2~XL, $\tau$ & 85.8 & 86.2 & 86.2 & 0.4 \\

28	\bottomrule
29	\end{tabular}
30	\end{table}
31	
32	Convergence confirms the signal resides in the features, not the classifier; this ceiling extends to cross-model transfer, where XGBoost (67.2\%), ordinal MLP (66.7\%), and prototypical networks (66.6\%) all match the RF baseline (66.4\%) within 0.8\,pp (Appendix~\ref{app:learned_estimator}).
33	A feature-group ablation further localizes the signal: the 9 perplexity features alone recover 66.0\% ($-$0.5\,pp vs.\ full), while repetition/diversity features alone reach only 53.0\% ($-$13.6\,pp; Appendix~\ref{app:feature_ablation}), confirming perplexity degradation as the dominant depth marker.
34	Raw perplexity (mean/median) performs at chance (25.1\%); the strongest single feature (\texttt{p90\_ppl}) achieves 58.3\% ($-$8.3\,pp vs.\ full), confirming that ordinal depth estimation requires multi-dimensional characterization of the perplexity distribution rather than a single threshold.
35	Figure~\ref{fig:confusion_matrix} shows d0 near-perfectly identified; errors concentrate at d2/d3 in-distribution and spread to d1--d3 under transfer (seed std $= 0.06$\,pp; Appendix~\ref{app:rf_seed}).

41	\label{fig:confusion_matrix}
42	\end{figure}
43	
44	\subsection{Cross-Model Transfer}
45	\label{sec:gen:crossmodel}
46	
47	We perform leave-one-model-family-out evaluation: train on two families (nucleus only), test on the held-out third (Table~\ref{tab:cross_model}).
48	
49	\begin{table}[t]

51	\small
52	\caption{Cross-model transfer (leave-one-out, nucleus only). Chance = 25\% / 33\% (d1--d3). d1--d3 bal.\ acc: Pythia 49.9\%, OLMo 59.2\%, GPT-2~XL 57.2\% (mean 55.4\%).}
53	\label{tab:cross_model}

66	\end{table}
67	
68	Mean transfer accuracy is 66.4\% (2.7$\times$ chance); d0 recall ($>$98\%) inflates the headline (d1--d3 balanced mean 55.4\%).
69	
70	\subsection{Cross-Strategy Transfer}
71	\label{sec:gen:crossstrategy}
72	
73	Table~\ref{tab:cross_strategy} reports leave-one-strategy-out transfer.
74	
75	\begin{table}[t]
76	\centering
77	\small
78	\caption{Cross-strategy transfer (leave-one-out). Chance = 25\% / 33\% (d1--d3). d0 recall $\geq$89\% inflates headline; d1--d3 mean: 45.9\%.}
79	\label{tab:cross_strategy}
80	\begin{tabular}{lccc}

82	Holdout & Pythia & OLMo & GPT-2 XL \\

88	\bottomrule
89	\end{tabular}
90	\end{table}
91	
92	Mean cross-strategy accuracy (59.1\%) falls 7pp below cross-model transfer (66.4\%); excluding d0, d1--d3 accuracy drops to 45.9\% (chance = 33\%).
93	Training on nucleus + top-$k$ and testing on temperature inverts the d1/d2 boundary (d1v2 AUC $<$ 0.5); per-strategy z-score normalization partially recovers it but leaves a residual gap (Limitations).
94	A multi-temperature ablation (Appendix~\ref{app:multi_tau}) confirms within-$\tau$ signal for $\tau \leq 0.9$ but collapse at $\tau{=}1.1$; end-to-end PLMs lag RF by 20pp (Appendix~\ref{app:e2e}).
95	
96	\paragraph{Prompted generation.}
97	Replicating the GPT-2~XL nucleus pipeline with topic-seeded generation yields 69.5\% (95\% CI $[68.9, 70.2]$, $-$13.8\,pp vs.\ BOS-seeded, $2.8\times$ chance), with monotonic AUC decay and identical top features (Appendix~\ref{app:prompted_gen}): prompt conditioning attenuates but does not eliminate the depth signal.
98	
99	%% ----------------------------------------------------------------
100	\subsection{Preliminary Cross-Scale Observations}
101	\label{sec:gen:crossscale}
102	
103	Extending to 7--8B under QLoRA, Llama-3.1-8B Instruct achieves 70.2\% ($\mathrm{EDD}_{0.70}{=}4$) and Qwen2.5-7B 60.1\% ($\mathrm{EDD}_{0.70}{>}5$).
104	A base-model control (Llama-3.1-8B, 59.9\%, non-monotonic AUC) vs.\ instruction-tuned (70.2\%, monotonic) suggests instruction tuning \emph{regularizes} recursive degradation; a 1.5B instruct control (47.4\%, $1.9\times$ chance) confirms at matched scale (Appendix~\ref{app:instruct_1p5b}).
105	Cross-model chains (84.75\%), cross-domain (arXiv 74.1\%), and LoRA rank sensitivity ($\Delta{=}4.65$\,pp; Appendix~\ref{app:cross_scale_full}) further confirm robustness.

4	We formalized recursive generation depth estimation as ordinal classification and showed that perplexity tail statistics achieve 69--86\% four-class accuracy ($\mathrm{EDD}_{0.75}{=}4$), with five features sufficing for 97.6\% of full performance.
5	LoRA fine-tuning loss decreases monotonically with depth for all three families, supporting model collapse theory~\cite{shumailov2024_nature,dohmatob2024_tale_of_tails}; instruction tuning regularizes this compression (\S\ref{sec:gen:crossscale}).
6	Cross-strategy transfer and depth-quality entanglement (depth estimation may partially conflate recursive depth with quality degradation) remain open challenges (Limitations).

```text
Now I have all the paper sections. Let me also read the results_summary.json for cross-checking numbers, and check for em-dashes.

Let me do a systematic review:

## 1. AI Writing Traces

### Em-dashes (—)
Let me search for em-dashes and en-dashes in all tex files.

### -ing phrase endings
Let me look for "-ing" at end of sentences/clauses.

### Furthermore/Moreover/Additionally
Let me check for these transition words.

### Numbers consistency
Cross-check with registry/results_summary.

Let me do all the grep searches.

/home/ubuntu/.agent-ml-research-idea_gen_0513_2/projects/recursive_gen_depth_est/docs/paper/atlas.tex:46:Despite the 17.1~pp accuracy spread across cells, a small feature family dominates in every setting.
/home/ubuntu/.agent-ml-research-idea_gen_0513_2/projects/recursive_gen_depth_est/docs/paper/atlas.tex:48:Table~\ref{tab:feature_importance} shows the full per-cell ranking.
/home/ubuntu/.agent-ml-research-idea_gen_0513_2/projects/recursive_gen_depth_est/docs/paper/atlas.tex:112:We extend the benchmark to depth $d{=}5$ for all three models under nucleus sampling.

Shaded bands: bootstrap 95\% CIs.}
/home/ubuntu/.agent-ml-research-idea_gen_0513_2/projects/recursive_gen_depth_est/docs/paper/conclusion.tex:5:Cross-strategy transfer induces a d1/d2 boundary inversion under temperature sampling.
/home/ubuntu/.agent-ml-research-idea_gen_0513_2/projects/recursive_gen_depth_est/docs/paper/conclusion.tex:11:Practical deployment requires either strategy metadata or learned routing.
/home/ubuntu/.agent-ml-research-idea_gen_0513_2/projects/recursive_gen_depth_est/docs/paper/conclusion.tex:17:\paragraph{Controlled vs.\ ecological setting.}
/home/ubuntu/.agent-ml-research-idea_gen_0513_2/projects/recursive_gen_depth_est/docs/paper/method.tex:12:This is an ordinal classification problem: depths carry a natural ordering, and $d{=}1$ is structurally closer to $d{=}0$ than $d{=}3$ is, since each generation step compounds distributional drift.
/home/ubuntu/.agent-ml-research-idea_gen_0513_2/projects/recursive_gen_depth_est/docs/paper/generalization.tex:9:Table~\ref{tab:baselines} evaluates bagging (RF) and gradient boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM) on the same 19 features; per-cell spread is $\leq$0.4pp, establishing a feature-determined ceiling.
/home/ubuntu/.agent-ml-research-idea_gen_0513_2/projects/recursive_gen_depth_est/docs/paper/section_appendix.tex:7:Figure~\ref{fig:feature_trajectory} in the main text shows feature trajectories for nucleus ($p{=}0.95$) and temperature ($\tau{=}0.9$) sampling.

/home/ubuntu/.agent-ml-research-idea_gen_0513_2/projects/recursive_gen_depth_est/docs/paper/section_appendix.tex:78:Both DeepSeek V3.2 and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct use identical prompting.
/home/ubuntu/.agent-ml-research-idea_gen_0513_2/projects/recursive_gen_depth_est/docs/paper/section_appendix.tex:80:The user message presents the passage (truncated to ${\approx}$384 words) and requests a JSON response containing an integer depth prediction (0--3), a confidence score, and a one-sentence reasoning.
/home/ubuntu/.agent-ml-research-idea_gen_0513_2/projects/recursive_gen_depth_est/docs/paper/section_appendix.tex:155:PLM representations excel at surface lexical features (TTR: $R^2{=}0.85$, repeated bigrams) but fail to capture perplexity distribution statistics; \textsc{var\_surprisal} and \textsc{p90\_ppl} yield negative $R^2$ under linear probing, indicating these features are not linearly accessible in the pretrained representation space.
/home/ubuntu/.agent-ml-research-idea_gen_0513_2/projects/recursive_gen_depth_est/docs/paper/section_appendix.tex:317:We extend the benchmark to two 7--8B models: Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, both under 4-bit NF4 QLoRA fine-tuning, generating depths $d \in \{0, 1, \ldots, 5\}$ with nucleus sampling ($p{=}0.95$, 500 samples per depth).
/home/ubuntu/.agent-ml-research-idea_gen_0513_2/projects/recursive_gen_depth_est/docs/paper/section_appendix.tex:321:Table~\ref{tab:cross_scale} contrasts the two 7--8B models with the three 1--1.5B models on matched evaluation (nucleus sampling, depths 0--3).
/home/ubuntu/.agent-ml-research-idea_gen_0513_2/projects/recursive_gen_depth_est/docs/paper/section_appendix.tex:386:The base model exhibits non-monotonic decay with a U-shaped recovery at $d_{3\text{v}4}$, while the instruction-tuned variant shows strictly monotonic decay. Both variants exceed chance (AUC $> 0.5$) at all boundaries, confirming depth signal exists regardless of instruction-tuning, though instruction-tuning strengthens and regularizes it.
/home/ubuntu/.agent-ml-research-idea_gen_0513_2/projects/recursive_gen_depth_est/docs/paper/section_appendix.tex:394:Four confounds limit these results: (1)~4-bit NF4 QLoRA quantization (absent at 1--1.5B) may distort the perplexity distribution independently of depth; (2)~smaller sample size (500 vs.\ 5{,}000 per depth) widens confidence intervals; (3)~evaluation is limited to nucleus sampling, leaving other strategies untested at this scale; (4)~vocabulary mismatch between 7--8B generators and the 1.4B reference model.
/home/ubuntu/.agent-ml-research-idea_gen_0513_2/projects/recursive_gen_depth_est/docs/paper/section_appendix.tex:515:The narrow spread ($\leq$0.8\,pp across four methods) reinforces the conclusion that the 19-feature representation, not the classifier, determines the accuracy ceiling in the cross-model transfer setting.
/home/ubuntu/.agent-ml-research-idea_gen_0513_2/projects/recursive_gen_depth_est/docs/paper/section_appendix.tex:659:Importance weighting \cite{sugiyama2007_importance_weighting} could further enable continuous depth-aware data selection rather than discrete thresholding.
/home/ubuntu/.agent-ml-research-idea_gen_0513_2/projects/recursive_gen_depth_est/docs/paper/introduction.tex:6:This model$\to$data$\to$model cycle is no longer hypothetical; it is already occurring in the wild. Yet we lack the ability to determine how many recursive iterations a given text has undergone, a distinction that matters because first-generation synthetic text may be benign or even beneficial for training, while deeply recursive text drives the distributional collapse that degrades model quality \cite{dohmatob2024_tale_of_tails}.
/home/ubuntu/.agent-ml-research-idea_gen_0513_2/projects/recursive_gen_depth_est/docs/paper/introduction.tex:32:    \item \textbf{Diagnostic ablations.} LoRA rank spread 4.65\,pp, three reference architectures (67--79\%), generation length scaling, and surface-text control (zero-shot LLMs at 30--36\%, 43\,pp below RF) confirming the signal resides in distributional statistics; 19 features and a Random Forest suffice for GPU-free inference.

Good findings:

1. **Em-dashes (—)**: Zero found ✓
2. **En-dashes ( – )**: Zero found ✓  
3. **Furthermore/Moreover/Additionally/Notably/It is worth noting**: Zero found ✓
4. **-ing patterns**: Let me check which ones are actually problematic (participial phrase endings)

Looking at the -ing matches more carefully:
- Most are normal usage: "sampling", "setting", "ranking", "tuning", "decoding", etc.


- The real issue is participial phrases ending sentences like "..., highlighting the..." or "..., confirming the..." — but checking the actual instances, they're mostly acceptable usage in bullet points and standard constructions rather than the awkward dangling patterns I'm looking for.

/home/ubuntu/.agent-ml-research-idea_gen_0513_2/projects/recursive_gen_depth_est/docs/paper/related_work.tex:7:\citet{schaeffer2025} argue that ``model collapse'' conflates multiple distinct phenomena, underscoring the need for operationally precise metrics.
/home/ubuntu/.agent-ml-research-idea_gen_0513_2/projects/recursive_gen_depth_est/docs/paper/atlas.tex:35:Depth-0 recall exceeds 98\% in all 9 cells, confirming that human-written text is trivially separable from any generation depth.
/home/ubuntu/.agent-ml-research-idea_gen_0513_2/projects/recursive_gen_depth_est/docs/paper/atlas.tex:57:Variance inflation analysis reveals VIF${>}$10 for 14--16 of 19 features, placing the effective independent dimensionality at ${\approx}$4--5.
/home/ubuntu/.agent-ml-research-idea_gen_0513_2/projects/recursive_gen_depth_est/docs/paper/atlas.tex:98:Depth features exhibit strong monotonic trends: perplexity tail statistics (\texttt{p90\_ppl}, \texttt{mean\_surprisal}) decrease with depth (Spearman $\rho = -1.0$ across cell-level medians) while repetition features increase, reflecting the complementary narrowing and self-repetition of distribution collapse.
/home/ubuntu/.agent-ml-research-idea_gen_0513_2/projects/recursive_gen_depth_est/docs/paper/atlas.tex:123:For the three-model mean profile (excess values $0.453, 0.362, 0.266, 0.183$ for pairs d1v2 through d4v5), the contraction ratio decreases from 0.80 to 0.69, indicating accelerating convergence toward indistinguishability.
/home/ubuntu/.agent-ml-research-idea_gen_0513_2/projects/recursive_gen_depth_est/docs/paper/atlas.tex:130:All three models cross the $T{=}0.75$ threshold within the d3--d4 region, establishing a consistent depth-4 decay boundary with graded confidence rather than uniform statistical significance.
/home/ubuntu/.agent-ml-research-idea_gen_0513_2/projects/recursive_gen_depth_est/docs/paper/atlas.tex:131:The d4-vs-d5 saturation is unambiguous across models, supporting the interpretation of d3--d4 as a \emph{transition zone} from discriminable to indistinguishable regime.
/home/ubuntu/.agent-ml-research-idea_gen_0513_2/projects/recursive_gen_depth_est/docs/paper/atlas.tex:170:Temperature ($\tau{=}0.9$) yields the highest accuracy in 2/3 models (GPT-2~XL 85.9\%, OLMo 82.1\%) because uniform logit scaling accelerates convergence to an attractor distribution~\cite{shumailov2024_nature}, amplifying the statistical fingerprint. However, this acceleration creates a boundary reversal risk: temperature depth-$N$ features approximate nucleus/top-$k$ depth-$(N{+}1)$ features, causing cross-strategy classifiers to systematically overpredict depth (\S\ref{sec:generalization}).
/home/ubuntu/.agent-ml-research-idea_gen_0513_2/projects/recursive_gen_depth_est/docs/paper/conclusion.tex:6:[Omitted long matching line]
/home/ubuntu/.agent-ml-research-idea_gen_0513_2/projects/recursive_gen_depth_est/docs/paper/conclusion.tex:18:The primary benchmark uses Wikipedia seed text with controlled LoRA fine-tuning (1--1.5B models), isolating the depth variable but diverging from wild contamination where models train on mixed corpora with prior-generation outputs at unknown proportions.
/home/ubuntu/.agent-ml-research-idea_gen_0513_2/projects/recursive_gen_depth_est/docs/paper/conclusion.tex:35:Our cross-strategy transfer results provide an empirical example: training on nucleus + top-$k$ and testing on temperature yields d1-vs-d2 AUC as low as 0.129 (GPT-2~XL) and 0.253 (OLMo), violating the monotonicity assumption.
/home/ubuntu/.agent-ml-research-idea_gen_0513_2/projects/recursive_gen_depth_est/docs/paper/conclusion.tex:43:Empirically, the self-model configuration does not yield the highest accuracy (Pythia 78.7\% vs.\ GPT-2~XL 85.9\%), suggesting the overlap does not confer a systematic advantage.
/home/ubuntu/.agent-ml-research-idea_gen_0513_2/projects/recursive_gen_depth_est/docs/paper/conclusion.tex:46:Reference-free surface features alone achieve 53.7\% (confirming partial signal in lexical statistics) but 25pp below the full pipeline, underscoring that surprisal-based features are essential.
/home/ubuntu/.agent-ml-research-idea_gen_0513_2/projects/recursive_gen_depth_est/docs/paper/conclusion.tex:50:Independent replication with seed=43 yields 77.15\% (95\% CI [76.4, 78.15], $\Delta{=}{-}1.05$\,pp vs.\ baseline); cross-seed transfer retains 76.76\% ($\Delta{=}{-}1.30$\,pp vs.\ within-seed avg), confirming depth signal is inherent to the recursive process rather than specific LoRA weights (Appendix~\ref{app:seed_replication}).
/home/ubuntu/.agent-ml-research-idea_gen_0513_2/projects/recursive_gen_depth_est/docs/paper/conclusion.tex:55:Detection features degrade under domain shift \cite{pudasaini2026_detection_fails}, and curated synthetic data may not trigger collapse \cite{falahati2026_curated}, attenuating the fingerprints we exploit.
/home/ubuntu/.agent-ml-research-idea_gen_0513_2/projects/recursive_gen_depth_est/docs/paper/method.tex:36:There is no per-passage lineage across depths, ensuring cross-validation splits do not introduce information leakage.
/home/ubuntu/.agent-ml-research-idea_gen_0513_2/projects/recursive_gen_depth_est/docs/paper/method.tex:46:We extract a feature vector $\mathbf{f}(x)$ comprising 19 candidate features from the reference-model perplexity distribution over each passage $x$; ablation (\S\ref{sec:atlas:features}) shows the top 5 achieve 97.6\% of full-set performance, and variance inflation analysis reveals VIF${>}$10 for 14--16 features, placing the effective independent dimensionality at ${\approx}$4--5.
/home/ubuntu/.agent-ml-research-idea_gen_0513_2/projects/recursive_gen_depth_est/docs/paper/method.tex:86:Each pair uses an independent classifier, avoiding the decision boundary dilution that arises in multi-class settings (\S\ref{sec:atlas:edd}).
/home/ubuntu/.agent-ml-research-idea_gen_0513_2/projects/recursive_gen_depth_est/docs/paper/generalization.tex:9:Table~\ref{tab:baselines} evaluates bagging (RF) and gradient boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM) on the same 19 features; per-cell spread is $\leq$0.4pp, establishing a feature-determined ceiling.
/home/ubuntu/.agent-ml-research-idea_gen_0513_2/projects/recursive_gen_depth_est/docs/paper/generalization.tex:14:Single-feature regression on mean perplexity performs at chance (25.1\%); zero-shot LLMs (DeepSeek V3.2, 36.2\%; Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, 30.4\%) also fail (43\,pp below RF; Appendix~\ref{app:zeroshot_prompt}), confirming depth signal resides in distributional statistics inaccessible from surface text.
/home/ubuntu/.agent-ml-research-idea_gen_0513_2/projects/recursive_gen_depth_est/docs/paper/generalization.tex:34:Raw perplexity (mean/median) performs at chance (25.1\%); the strongest single feature (\texttt{p90\_ppl}) achieves 58.3\% ($-$8.3\,pp vs.\ full), confirming that ordinal depth estimation requires multi-dimensional characterization of the perplexity distribution rather than a single threshold.
/home/ubuntu/.agent-ml-research-idea_gen_0513_2/projects/recursive_gen_depth_est/docs/paper/section_appendix.tex:19:Per-cell top-5 overlap between SHAP and permutation importance is 3--4 out of 5 features; the aggregated (mean-across-cells) top-5 sets are identical, confirming that the top features are robust to the choice of importance measure at the aggregate level while per-cell rankings exhibit model-dependent variation.
/home/ubuntu/.agent-ml-research-idea_gen_0513_2/projects/recursive_gen_depth_est/docs/paper/section_appendix.tex:97:For $\tau \in [0.5, 0.9]$, d1-vs-d2 AUC exceeds 0.80 (peak 0.851 at $\tau{=}0.7$, comparable to nucleus $p{=}0.95$'s 0.861) and 4-class accuracy ranges from 75.4\% to 77.3\% (Table~\ref{tab:multi_tau_within}), confirming the depth signal is not an artifact of a single temperature.
/home/ubuntu/.agent-ml-research-idea_gen_0513_2/projects/recursive_gen_depth_est/docs/paper/section_appendix.tex:108:Holdout $\tau{=}0.5$ produces inverted d1v2 AUC (0.176), confirming that different temperatures produce surprisal distributions with incompatible shapes.
/home/ubuntu/.agent-ml-research-idea_gen_0513_2/projects/recursive_gen_depth_est/docs/paper/section_appendix.tex:109:This extends the strategy-specificity finding: even within a single decoding family, the feature space is temperature-specific, reinforcing the need for strategy-conditioned classifiers.
/home/ubuntu/.agent-ml-research-idea_gen_0513_2/projects/recursive_gen_depth_est/docs/paper/section_appendix.tex:155:PLM representations excel at surface lexical features (TTR: $R^2{=}0.85$, repeated bigrams) but fail to capture perplexity distribution statistics; \textsc{var\_surprisal} and \textsc{p90\_ppl} yield negative $R^2$ under linear probing, indicating these features are not linearly accessible in the pretrained representation space.
/home/ubuntu/.agent-ml-research-idea_gen_0513_2/projects/recursive_gen_depth_est/docs/paper/section_appendix.tex:161:DeBERTa-v3-base \cite{he2021_deberta_v3} and RoBERTa-base \cite{liu2019_roberta} finetuned end-to-end achieve 58.3\% ($\pm$4.7\%) and 59.5\% ($\pm$3.2\%) respectively, lagging the RF baseline (78.7\%) by 20.4pp and 19.2pp.
/home/ubuntu/.agent-ml-research-idea_gen_0513_2/projects/recursive_gen_depth_est/docs/paper/section_appendix.tex:185:Linear probing of PLM [CLS] representations yields negative $R^2$ for both \texttt{var\_surprisal} and \texttt{p90\_ppl} (\S\ref{app:feature_overlap}), indicating that pretrained representations lack the linear structure needed to recover perplexity tail statistics, a systematic representational gap rather than a backbone-specific artifact.
/home/ubuntu/.agent-ml-research-idea_gen_0513_2/projects/recursive_gen_depth_est/docs/paper/section_appendix.tex:187:DCOL \cite{cloc2025} reached 64.5\% (\S\ref{app:dcol_iterations}); all end-to-end approaches (58--65\%) underperform feature-based methods, suggesting depth estimation benefits from targeted statistical features that capture distributional tail properties absent from PLM representations.
/home/ubuntu/.agent-ml-research-idea_gen_0513_2/projects/recursive_gen_depth_est/docs/paper/section_appendix.tex:201:Five-fold CV accuracy on 3-class (d1/d2/d3) classification ranges from 59\% to 82\% across the 9 atlas cells (up to 2.5$\times$ above the 33.3\% chance level), confirming that depth signal is the dominant classification factor.
/home/ubuntu/.agent-ml-research-idea_gen_0513_2/projects/recursive_gen_depth_est/docs/paper/section_appendix.tex:205:LOGO mean accuracy is 72.1\% (range 59.5--81.6\%), matching standard CV (72.0\%) within noise (before fix: 64.0\%, reflecting the depth--group confound).
/home/ubuntu/.agent-ml-research-idea_gen_0513_2/projects/recursive_gen_depth_est/docs/paper/section_appendix.tex:206:Per-cell fold standard deviations range from 0.4pp to 1.4pp, indicating that cross-group generalization is as reliable as within-group classification.
/home/ubuntu/.agent-ml-research-idea_gen_0513_2/projects/recursive_gen_depth_est/docs/paper/section_appendix.tex:211:The depth-to-seed-group accuracy ratio is 7.1$\times$, confirming that the feature representation encodes depth but not seed-article identity.
/home/ubuntu/.agent-ml-research-idea_gen_0513_2/projects/recursive_gen_depth_est/docs/paper/section_appendix.tex:241:On WikiText-103, all three classifiers achieve $\geq$98.5\% d0 accuracy, confirming that editorial text is reliably distinguished from recursive generations across model families.
/home/ubuntu/.agent-ml-research-idea_gen_0513_2/projects/recursive_gen_depth_est/docs/paper/section_appendix.tex:317:We extend the benchmark to two 7--8B models: Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, both under 4-bit NF4 QLoRA fine-tuning, generating depths $d \in \{0, 1, \ldots, 5\}$ with nucleus sampling ($p{=}0.95$, 500 samples per depth).
/home/ubuntu/.agent-ml-research-idea_gen_0513_2/projects/recursive_gen_depth_est/docs/paper/section_appendix.tex:343:Both 7--8B models substantially exceed the 25\% chance baseline: Llama-3.1-8B achieves 70.2\% (95\% CI $[68.3, 72.4]$) and Qwen2.5-7B achieves 60.1\% ($[58.0, 62.1]$), confirming that recursive depth remains estimable from perplexity-based features even when the generator is 5--7$\times$ larger than the reference model.
/home/ubuntu/.agent-ml-research-idea_gen_0513_2/projects/recursive_gen_depth_est/docs/paper/section_appendix.tex:347:At threshold $T{=}0.70$, Qwen2.5-7B maintains all consecutive-pair AUCs above 0.70 through depth~5 (Table~\ref{tab:cross_scale_auc}), yielding $\mathrm{EDD}_{T{=}0.70} > 5$, exceeding the $\mathrm{EDD}{=}4$ observed at 1--1.5B.
/home/ubuntu/.agent-ml-research-idea_gen_0513_2/projects/recursive_gen_depth_est/docs/paper/section_appendix.tex:386:The base model exhibits non-monotonic decay with a U-shaped recovery at $d_{3\text{v}4}$, while the instruction-tuned variant shows strictly monotonic decay. Both variants exceed chance (AUC $> 0.5$) at all boundaries, confirming depth signal exists regardless of instruction-tuning, though instruction-tuning strengthens and regularizes it.
/home/ubuntu/.agent-ml-research-idea_gen_0513_2/projects/recursive_gen_depth_est/docs/paper/section_appendix.tex:407:Each recursive step uses a \emph{different} model family, eliminating the possibility that depth signal arises from a single model's idiosyncratic behavior.
/home/ubuntu/.agent-ml-research-idea_gen_0513_2/projects/recursive_gen_depth_est/docs/paper/section_appendix.tex:421:If the classifier exploited architecture fingerprints rather than depth signal, reversing the chain should invert depth predictions; the equivalent accuracy under both orderings provides empirical evidence against the architecture confound.
/home/ubuntu/.agent-ml-research-idea_gen_0513_2/projects/recursive_gen_depth_est/docs/paper/section_appendix.tex:458:Top-5 feature importance is identical across seeds (\texttt{var\_surprisal}, \texttt{p90\_ppl}, \texttt{mean\_ppl}, \texttt{var\_ppl}, \texttt{p75\_ppl}), confirming that depth signal arises from the recursive process itself rather than idiosyncratic LoRA weight configurations.
/home/ubuntu/.agent-ml-research-idea_gen_0513_2/projects/recursive_gen_depth_est/docs/paper/section_appendix.tex:488:Individual class deltas range from $-$0.45\,pp to $-$2.43\,pp (d1 shows the largest shift), confirming that the RF classifier operates on per-sample features without sensitivity to the class distribution of the evaluation corpus.
/home/ubuntu/.agent-ml-research-idea_gen_0513_2/projects/recursive_gen_depth_est/docs/paper/section_appendix.tex:520:To test whether instruction tuning eliminates depth signal at matched scale (1.5B, avoiding the quantization confound of \S\ref{sec:gen:crossscale}), we run the full recursive pipeline on Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct with self-reference feature extraction (i.e., the same model serves as both generator and reference).
/home/ubuntu/.agent-ml-research-idea_gen_0513_2/projects/recursive_gen_depth_est/docs/paper/section_appendix.tex:522:The RF classifier achieves 47.4\% four-class accuracy (95\% CI $[46.7, 48.1]$, $1.9\times$ chance), confirming that instruction tuning reduces but does not eliminate depth signal.
/home/ubuntu/.agent-ml-research-idea_gen_0513_2/projects/recursive_gen_depth_est/docs/paper/section_appendix.tex:582:The 9 perplexity features nearly match the full set ($\Delta{=}{-}0.5$\,pp), while repetition/diversity features alone fall 13.6\,pp below, confirming that perplexity degradation statistics carry the dominant depth signal.
/home/ubuntu/.agent-ml-research-idea_gen_0513_2/projects/recursive_gen_depth_est/docs/paper/section_appendix.tex:622:Generation is conditioned on Wikipedia topic prompts rather than a bare BOS token, providing a more ecologically valid test of depth signal persistence.
/home/ubuntu/.agent-ml-research-idea_gen_0513_2/projects/recursive_gen_depth_est/docs/paper/section_appendix.tex:648:The 13.8\,pp drop relative to BOS-seeded generation is expected: topic prompts constrain the output distribution, reducing the variance that distinguishes depths.
/home/ubuntu/.agent-ml-research-idea_gen_0513_2/projects/recursive_gen_depth_est/docs/paper/section_appendix.tex:649:Nevertheless, accuracy remains $2.8\times$ chance and pairwise AUC decays monotonically (0.916, 0.782, 0.744), confirming that the depth signal is not an artifact of unconstrained generation.
/home/ubuntu/.agent-ml-research-idea_gen_0513_2/projects/recursive_gen_depth_est/docs/paper/section_appendix.tex:650:Top features are identical to BOS-seeded (\texttt{p90\_ppl} first), indicating the same perplexity tail erosion mechanism operates under prompted conditions.
/home/ubuntu/.agent-ml-research-idea_gen_0513_2/projects/recursive_gen_depth_est/docs/paper/introduction.tex:9:Binary detectors such as Binoculars \cite{binoculars2024}, Fast-DetectGPT \cite{fast_detectgpt2024}, and DivEye \cite{diveye2026} classify text as human-written or machine-generated, collapsing all depths $d \geq 1$ into a single category.
/home/ubuntu/.agent-ml-research-idea_gen_0513_2/projects/recursive_gen_depth_est/docs/paper/introduction.tex:16:Instruction-tuned variants exhibit monotonically decreasing AUC (regularization), whereas base models can show non-monotonic trajectories, suggesting that instruction tuning acts as a regularizer on the depth signal rather than introducing degradation.

1	\section{Related Work}
2	\label{sec:related}
3	
4	\paragraph{Model Collapse Theory.}
5	\citet{shumailov2024_nature} demonstrate that recursive training on model outputs erodes distributional tails; \citet{dohmatob2024_tale_of_tails} formalize this via scaling laws \cite{seddik2024synthetic}, \citet{dohmatob2025_strong_collapse} establish strong collapse guarantees, and the MAD framework \cite{alemohammad2024_mad} extends the analysis to self-consuming models.
6	Subsequent work addresses mitigation \cite{gerstgrasser2024_accumulate,drayson2025_detection_prevents_collapse,yi2026_escaping_collapse,falahati2026_curated,wenzek2020_ccnet}, non-monotonic dynamics \cite{bakshi2026_collapse_improvement}, convergence \cite{marchi2024_heat_death,wang2026_contamination,knowledge_collapse2025,dohmatob2024_demystified}, and diversity decline \cite{guo2024curious,briesch2024selfconsuming,padmakumar2024diversity,sigma2026_spectral,synthetic_eggs2026}.
7	\citet{schaeffer2025} argue that ``model collapse'' conflates multiple distinct phenomena, underscoring the need for operationally precise metrics.
8	Dohmatob et al.\ predict that recursive training erodes distributional tails as a theoretical scaling law \citep{dohmatob2024_tale_of_tails}; we operationalize this prediction into a deployable ordinal classifier, revealing strategy-dependent trajectories and non-monotonic 7B behavior that the theory does not predict.
9	All assume depth is known a priori; we address the inverse problem of estimating depth from text alone.
10	
11	\paragraph{AI Text Detection.}
12	The detection literature \cite{wu2025_detection_survey} spans statistical methods (DetectGPT \cite{mitchell2023_detectgpt}, Fast-DetectGPT \cite{fast_detectgpt2024}, Binoculars \cite{binoculars2024}, DivEye \cite{diveye2026}, GLTR \cite{gehrmann2019_gltr}, Ghostbuster \cite{verma2024_ghostbuster}, DNA-GPT \cite{yang2024_dnagpt}), geometric approaches based on intrinsic dimensionality \cite{tulchinskii2024_intrinsic_dim}, and watermarking \cite{kirchenbauer2023_watermark}, with known limits from paraphrasing \cite{sadasivan2023_paraphrase}, distribution shift \cite{pudasaini2026_detection_fails}, and generator barriers \cite{pu2026_generator_barrier}.
13	M4-SemEval \cite{wang2024_m4_semeval}, RAID \cite{dugan2024_raid}, and MAGE \cite{li2024_mage} benchmark detection across domains, models, and adversarial conditions.
14	All these methods perform binary classification, discarding ordinal depth information; our approach outputs ordinal depth labels, complementing rather than replacing binary detection.
15	
16	\paragraph{Adjacent Tasks.}
17	EditLens \cite{editlens2026} estimates editing extent but does not model recursive chains; \citet{uchendu2020_attribution} classify \emph{which} model generated text; LOKI \cite{loki2025} benchmarks synthetic data detection across modalities.
18	\citet{mohamed2025_broken_telephone} study iterative generation as a ``broken telephone'' effect, characterizing \emph{how} text degrades without classifying which iteration a passage comes from.
19	Our task performs the inverse, ordinal depth estimation from text alone, discriminating between adjacent depths rather than merely detecting aggregate degradation.
20	
21	\paragraph{Ordinal Classification.}
22	Ordinal classification has a long history \cite{mccullagh1980_ordinal}: \citet{frank2001} reduce ordinal problems to nested binary tasks, and \citet{rennie2005} introduce loss functions tailored to discrete ordered labels.
23	CORAL \cite{coral2020} enforces rank consistency via ordered binary tasks; CLOC \cite{cloc2025} extends contrastive learning with multi-margin ordinal losses.
24	We adopt both as baselines (\S\ref{sec:generalization}) to confirm the signal is accessible to principled ordinal methods.
25	
26	\paragraph{Decoding Strategy Effects.}
27	Decoding strategies shape text statistics in ways that interact with depth signals \cite{holtzman2020_nucleus,finlayson2024_closing,garces_arias2025_decoding_decoded,wiher2022_decoding,basu2021_mirostat}.
28	Our Depth Degradation Atlas (\S\ref{sec:atlas}) reveals that these strategies induce qualitatively different degradation trajectories under recursive generation: temperature sampling accelerates convergence to a low-entropy attractor while top-$k$ attenuates the depth signal, effects beyond single-pass text quality.

Now let me analyze the findings:

## 1. AI Writing Traces

**Em-dashes (—)**: Zero ✓ Clean.
**En-dashes ( – )**: Zero ✓ Clean.
**Furthermore/Moreover/Additionally/Notably**: Zero ✓ Clean.
**Blacklisted words** (delve, leverage, utilize, facilitate, myriad, plethora, paradigm shift, in the realm of): Zero ✓ Clean.

**-ing participial phrase endings**: There are many instances of ", confirming that..." / ", indicating that..." / ", suggesting that..." / ", establishing ..." / ", placing ..." / ", reflecting ..." / ", supporting ..." / ", attenuating ...". 

This is a significant pattern—I'm finding multiple instances of these participial constructions scattered throughout the main text, from line 35 through line 170, with examples like "confirming that human-written text is trivially separable," "placing the effective independent dimensionality," and "reflecting the complementary narrowing."

The pattern continues across other files too: generalization.tex has several instances starting at line 9, method.tex shows up at lines 36 and 46, and introduction.tex begins at line 9, while conclusion.tex contains examples at lines 18 and 35. This appears to be a systematic issue affecting the entire document structure.

Now I'm checking the numerical consistency in the paper. The performance ranges I'm seeing—like the 69-86% span for Pythia models and GPT-2 results—need to align with the actual experimental data.

Looking at the specific metrics: the 180K sample count checks out from the experimental design (9 cells × 4 depths × 5000), and the cross-model accuracy of 66.4% is consistent. The 2.7× multiplier for chance performance is a slight rounding of 66.4/25, which is acceptable. The zero-shot baseline ranges from about 30-36% across different models, and the prompted generation results around 69.5% all track correctly with what I'd expect from the data.

Now I'm verifying the claim about zero-shot performance being 43 percentage points below random forest. The best zero-shot result is 36.2% (DeepSeek), and if the random forest baseline is around 78.7%, that gives roughly 42.5 percentage points difference, which rounds to 43pp. Though there's some ambiguity in the abstract about which specific model and RF configuration this refers to, the math checks out for the most straightforward interpretation. I'm checking the specific numbers more carefully now. The 43pp gap likely comes from comparing DeepSeek's 36.2% (the better of the two LLMs) directly to RF's 78.7% on the same cell, which gives 42.5pp—close enough to round to 43pp. For the top-5 feature retention claim, the math checks out: 76.5 divided by 78.4 equals approximately 97.6%.

Now I'm noticing a potential issue with the generalization axes. The abstract claims "eight axes" but Generalization.tex line 4 explicitly states "seven generalization axes (four below, three in Appendix)." Let me verify by counting what's actually described: cross-model transfer, cross-strategy transfer, cross-scale, classifier comparison with surface-text ablation, prompted generation, cross-domain, and LoRA-rank ablation. That's seven distinct axes, not eight, so there's a discrepancy between what the abstract claims and what the paper documents. Total seven. But abstract says "eight axes."

After ROADMAP updates, the abstract was changed to "eight axes" with prompted generation added, but generalization.tex still lists "seven." That's a direct inconsistency between the abstract and section 5's opener—a critical issue.

Let me count what might constitute these eight axes. The abstract mentions cross-scale, prompted generation, cross-domain, and LoRA-rank ablation, but I need to map all of them across the sections. It looks like the original text counted seven axes, then prompted generation was added as the eighth, but section 5's introduction was never updated to reflect this change.

Now examining the claim strength and what might be underclaimed...

The instruction tuning results show a more complex picture than the current framing suggests. At the 7-8B scale, instruction-tuned models outperform base models (70.2% vs 59.9%), so instruction tuning actually helps preserve the depth signal. But at 1.5B, the instruct variant drops to 47.4%, which is lower than base models at the same scale. The current claims about instruction tuning reducing but not eliminating the depth signal, or regularizing recursive degradation, don't fully capture this scale-dependent behavior.

The monotonic vs non-monotonic AUC pattern between instruct and base models is a clean mechanistic finding that deserves more prominence in the paper rather than being treated as a supporting detail.

For the LoRA results, the monotonic decrease in loss across depth is direct evidence for progressive distributional narrowing during fine-tuning. While it's a training metric rather than a test metric, this finding could be elevated beyond just supporting the model collapse theory—it's a standalone observation about how LoRA affects the model's internal representations.

The 69.5% prompted generation result with -13.8pp attenuation is appropriately framed as "attenuates but does not eliminate" the signal, which honestly captures what the data shows without overclaiming ecological validity.

The feature bottleneck convergence across different model families and classifiers is remarkably tight—within 0.4pp for tree-based models and 0.8pp across cross-model transfer—which strongly validates that the signal is genuinely in the learned features rather than artifacts of specific architectures.

The d0 recall exceeding 98% across all nine cells is an exceptionally strong result with clear practical value for human text detection.

The cross-model chains reaching 84.75% is particularly compelling evidence that the depth signal transcends architectural differences, outperforming most single-model pipelines. The two-stage pipeline's +11.5pp improvement is currently positioned as a limitation workaround, but it's actually a meaningful contribution that deserves reframing as a solution rather than a caveat. There's also a critical discrepancy to fix—the text references "seven" somewhere but should say "eight"—and I'm noticing roughly twenty instances of -ing phrase saturation throughout the main text that could be tightened.

For strengthening the work further, I'm considering whether expanding seed robustness testing beyond just Pythia would be feasible, testing how passage length affects cross-model transfer specifically, and potentially substituting Gemini Flash for GPT-4o-mini to introduce a different model architecture into the recursive chains. The mixed-depth document simulation would be high-impact but probably too time-intensive.

Looking at potential reviewer concerns, the main gaps are around frontier model coverage, API model representation, and sample size for the 7B experiments. The reference model ablation on transfer and pairwise significance testing between methods could both meaningfully strengthen the claims, though I need to identify which experiment would give the most return within the time constraint.

For the most impactful work in under 4 hours, I'm weighing expanding the 7B sample size to tighten confidence intervals against running Gemini Flash through the API, which wouldn't require GPU time. Adding more seed replications is another option but less efficient.

Wait—I'm noticing the Discussion section is only 6 lines of LaTeX. That's far too sparse. It just covers the monotonic loss decrease and mentions depth-quality entanglement as an open challenge, but there's almost nothing on implications, limitations, or how this connects to broader work. A reviewer would definitely flag this as underdeveloped.

Actually, looking more carefully, the Limitations section in conclusion.tex is quite thorough at 56 lines—honest and detailed. But the actual Discussion content is minimal, and while the Limitations cover a lot of ground, they're not substituting for the kind of forward-looking implications and practical considerations that should be in the Discussion itself. For EMNLP 2026, this gap between a strong Limitations section and a weak Discussion is noticeable.

2	\label{app:additional}
3	
4	\subsection{Top-$k$ Feature Trajectories}
5	\label{app:topk_trajectories}
6	
7	Figure~\ref{fig:feature_trajectory} in the main text shows feature trajectories for nucleus ($p{=}0.95$) and temperature ($\tau{=}0.9$) sampling.
8	Top-$k$ ($k{=}50$) trajectories follow the same monotonically decreasing trend for all features but with compressed inter-depth spacing, consistent with the signal attenuation effect discussed in \S\ref{sec:atlas:strategy}.
9	Concretely, the d0$\to$d1 drop in \textsc{p90\_ppl} under top-$k$ is 78\% (vs.\ 87\% for nucleus), and the d2$\to$d3 reduction is 31\% (vs.\ 39\% for nucleus).
10	Despite the magnitude reduction, feature rank ordering across depths is preserved, which explains why ordinal classifiers maintain directionality even under top-$k$ conditions.
11	
12	\subsection{Permutation Importance}
13	\label{app:permutation}
14	
15	To verify that the Gini-based importance rankings in \S\ref{sec:atlas:features} are not an artifact of the impurity measure, we compute permutation importance (5-fold CV, 10 repeats) for all 9 atlas cells.
16	The top-2 features are stable across measures: \textsc{p90\_ppl} ranks in the top 2 in 9/9 cells under both Gini and permutation importance, and \textsc{var\_surprisal} in 8/9 (vs.\ 7/9 for Gini, with the additional cell being OLMo top-$k$; the single SHAP exception is GPT-2~XL top-$k$, where \textsc{p75\_ppl} displaces \textsc{var\_surprisal} to rank 3).
17	Kendall's $W{=}0.90$ across all three methods (Gini, permutation, SHAP) indicates strong concordance ($p{<}0.005$).
18	Pairwise Spearman correlations are: SHAP--Gini $\rho{=}0.93$, SHAP--permutation $\rho{=}0.84$, Gini--permutation $\rho{=}0.76$.
19	Per-cell top-5 overlap between SHAP and permutation importance is 3--4 out of 5 features; the aggregated (mean-across-cells) top-5 sets are identical, confirming that the top features are robust to the choice of importance measure at the aggregate level while per-cell rankings exhibit model-dependent variation.
20	
21	\subsection{Per-Class Recall}
22	\label{app:per_class}
23	
24	Table~\ref{tab:per_class_recall} reports per-class recall across all 9 atlas cells (4-class in-distribution, 5-fold CV).
25	Depth~0 recall exceeds 98\% uniformly.
26	Among generated depths, d2 is the hardest class in every cell; the deficit is most pronounced under top-$k$ sampling (46--53\%), where vocabulary truncation removes the tail tokens that carry depth-discriminative signal.

On our 3-model × 3-strategy benchmark (1–1.5B), Random Forest classifiers on 19 statistical features achieve 70–85% four-class accuracy (chance=25%), with the best configuration (GPT-2 XL, temp τ=0.9) reaching 85.4%. Feature-based methods (RF, CORAL, DivEye) consistently outperform single-feature baselines across all settings. **Scale robustness**: Clean FP16 13B experiment (Qwen2.5-14B, no quantization) confirms depth signal persists at mainstream model scale, addressing the \\\"small model only\\\" concern from prior 7B QLoRA experiments. **Ecological validity**: Prompted generation experiment (topic-seeded text, not BOS-only unconditional) confirms depth signal is not an artifact of unnatural generation mode.\\n\\n2. **Depth Degradation Atlas — systematic characterization of recursive collapse** (PRIMARY): We provide the first systematic empirical characterization of how text statistical properties evolve across recursive generation depths, revealing (a) perplexity tail statistics (p90_ppl) and surprisal variance (var_surprisal) as the dominant depth signal family — consistently occupying the top-4 features across all models and strategies, though their relative ranking is model-dependent, (b) non-uniform inter-depth distances (depth 0→1 gap >> depth 2→3 gap), (c) an Effective Discriminable Depth (EDD) boundary beyond which adjacent depths become indistinguishable, and (d) **strategy-dependent feature trajectory reversal** — temperature sampling causes the depth-1→depth-2 feature boundary to invert relative to nucleus/top-k (cross-strategy LOO d1v2 AUC as low as 0.13), demonstrating that decoding strategy fundamentally shapes the degradation trajectory rather than merely attenuating it, and (e) **accelerated convergence mechanism** — root cause analysis confirms a genuine structural distributional shift: temperature's uniform logit scaling (vs nucleus/top-k truncation) accelerates convergence to the attractor distribution, so temp09 depth N features ≈ nucleus/topk50 depth N+1 (GPT-2 XL temp09 d1 p90_ppl median=92.2, falls into nucleus/topk50 d2 range 65–92). This is not a simple scale artifact fixable by normalization — z-score normalization improves overall LR cross-strategy accuracy (25%→61%) but does **not** recover pairwise d1v2 AUC (GPT-2 XL 0.50→0.24, OLMo 0.50→0.19), and does **not** improve tree-based classifiers (RF Δ<0.02pp) — confirming a distributional shift that simple feature normalization cannot resolve; whether more sophisticated domain adaptation methods could recover the d1/d2 boundary remains open. This atlas spans 3 model families × 3 decoding strategies, with scale consistency confirmed at 14B.\\n\\n3. **Cross-strategy depth estimation via two-stage pipeline + strategy-invariant signal discovery**: Naive cross-strategy transfer degrades to 59.1% with d1v2 boundary inversion. We propose a two-stage solution: (a) strategy identification classifier (57.8% — strategies share more feature space than expected), then (b) strategy-conditioned depth classifiers. The pipeline improves cross-strategy accuracy by **+11.5pp** on average (59.1% → 70.5%), with per-model results: GPT-2 XL 73.0%, OLMo 69.4%, Pythia 69.3%. Oracle ceiling at 78.3%. **Caveat**: improvement is consistent across models but absolute accuracy varies (2/3 models individually below 70%); paper must claim \\\"+11.5pp improvement\\\" rather than \\\"≥70% universal recovery\\\". The surprising finding: even with imperfect strategy routing, the pipeline works because depth signal has a **strategy-invariant core** (~60% accuracy floor) plus a strategy-specific component. This reframes cross-strategy transfer from \\\"broken\\\" to \\\"substantially improved with clear ceiling for future work\\\".\\n\\n4. **[Discussion — Practical Implication]** Depth-graduated curation as alternative to binary filtering: predicted depth provides a finer-grained quality proxy than binary real/synthetic labels, enabling graduated weighting strategies. Conceptual argument supported by depth-accuracy correlation in 3×3 matrix data; full experimental validation deferred to future work (D012).\\n\\n## Story Spine\\n\\n- **Problem**: Web-scraped training corpora increasingly contain multi-generational synthetic content from uncontrolled model→data→model feedback loops. Existing detectors answer \\\"is this synthetic?\\\" but not \\\"how many recursive cycles has this undergone?\\\" — a critical distinction since 1st-gen synthetic data can improve training while deeply recursive text drives distribution collapse.\\n\\n- **Existing approaches & gaps**: Binary detectors (LOKI, DivEye, Binoculars) classify real vs. synthetic but discard ordinal depth information. EditLens estimates single-pass AI editing extent but not recursive depth. Model collapse studies (Drayson et al. EMNLP 2025; Shumailov et al. Nature 2024) characterize degradation patterns but assume depth is known a priori — no method estimates depth from text alone.\\n\\n- **Our framing**: We formalize ordinal generation depth estimation as a new task, construct a multi-generational benchmark spanning 1B–14B models across 3 decoding strategies and 4 depths, and provide the first **Depth Degradation Atlas** — a systematic empirical map of how text statistical properties evolve across recursive depths, models, and strategies. The Atlas reveals (a) perplexity tail statistics as universal \\n\\n... [截断: 省略 10021 字符，传 max_chars=0 获取完整内容]\", \"total_chars\": 16021, \"truncated\": true}, \"error\": null, \"metadata\": {}}"}

Feature-based methods (RF, CORAL, DivEye) consistently outperform single-feature baselines across all settings. **Scale robustness**: Clean FP16 13B experiment (Qwen2.5-14B, no quantization) confirms depth signal persists at mainstream model scale, addressing the \\\\\\\"small model only\\\\\\\" concern from prior 7B QLoRA experiments. **Ecological validity**: Prompted generation experiment (topic-seeded text, not BOS-only unconditional) confirms depth signal is not an artifact of unnatural generation mode.\\\\n\\\\n2. **Depth Degradation Atlas — systematic characterization of recursive collapse** (PRIMARY): We provide the first systematic empirical characterization of how text statistical properties evolve across recursive generation depths, revealing (a) perplexity tail statistics (p90_ppl) and surprisal variance (var_surprisal) as the dominant depth signal family — consistently occupying the top-4 features across all models and strategies, though their relative ranking is model-dependent, (b) non-uniform inter-depth distances (depth 0→1 gap >> depth 2→3 gap), (c) an Effective Discriminable Depth (EDD) boundary beyond which adjacent depths become indistinguishable, and (d) **strategy-dependent feature trajectory reversal** — temperature sampling causes the depth-1→depth-2 feature boundary to invert relative to nucleus/top-k (cross-strategy LOO d1v2 AUC as low as 0.13), demonstrating that decoding strategy fundamentally shapes the degradation trajectory rather than merely attenuating it, and (e) **accelerated convergence mechanism** — root cause analysis confirms a genuine structural distributional shift: temperature's uniform logit scaling (vs nucleus/top-k truncation) accelerates convergence to the attractor distribution, so temp09 depth N features ≈ nucleus/topk50 depth N+1 (GPT-2 XL temp09 d1 p90_ppl median=92.2, falls into nucleus/topk50 d2 range 65–92). This is not a simple scale artifact fixable by normalization — z-score normalization improves overall LR cross-strategy accuracy (25%→61%) but does **not** recover pairwise d1v2 AUC (GPT-2 XL 0.50→0.24, OLMo 0.50→0.19), and does **not** improve tree-based classifiers (RF Δ<0.02pp) — confirming a distributional shift that simple feature normalization cannot resolve; whether more sophisticated domain adaptation methods could recover the d1/d2 boundary remains open. This atlas spans 3 model families × 3 decoding strategies, with scale consistency confirmed at 14B.\\\\n\\\\n3. **Cross-strategy depth estimation via two-stage pipeline + strategy-invariant signal discovery**: Naive cross-strategy transfer degrades to 59.1% with d1v2 boundary inversion. We propose a two-stage solution: (a) strategy identification classifier (57.8% — strategies share more feature space than expected), then (b) strategy-conditioned depth classifiers. The pipeline improves cross-strategy accuracy by **+11.5pp** on average (59.1% → 70.5%), with per-model results: GPT-2 XL 73.0%, OLMo 69.4%, Pythia 69.3%. Oracle ceiling at 78.3%. **Caveat**: improvement is consistent across models but absolute accuracy varies (2/3 models individually below 70%); paper must claim \\\\\\\"+11.5pp improvement\\\\\\\" rather than \\\\\\\"≥70% universal recovery\\\\\\\". The surprising finding: even with imperfect strategy routing, the pipeline works because depth signal has a **strategy-invariant core** (~60% accuracy floor) plus a strategy-specific component.

OK I now have a very complete picture. Let me compile the full review. Key findings:

### CRITICAL
1. **"seven" vs "eight" axes discrepancy**: Abstract says "eight axes" but generalization.tex L4 says "seven generalization axes (four below, three in Appendix)." Must fix.

### WARNING: AI Writing Traces
2. **", confirming/indicating/establishing/suggesting..." participial phrases**: 54 occurrences across all tex files. In the main text alone (excluding appendix), at least 20-25 instances. This is a highly detectable AI writing pattern.


3. The Discussion section is severely underdeveloped—just three sentences that restate findings without exploring broader implications or future directions. Meanwhile, several strong results are buried or underemphasized: the cross-model chains achieving 84.75% accuracy directly challenges the architecture confound hypothesis, the two-stage pipeline's 11.5 percentage point improvement deserves prominence rather than relegation to Limitations, and the instruct regularization pattern shows interesting contrasts that warrant deeper analysis.

4. I've verified all the key numbers against the registry and results data—no numerical errors. For revisions, I need to fix the "seven" to "eight" typo and clean up some awkward -ing phrases, which should take a couple hours. Beyond that, adding a second seed replication on a different model like OLMo or GPT-2 XL would strengthen the reproducibility claims, and swapping in Gemini Flash for the blocked GPT-4o-mini in the recursive chain experiment would add architectural diversity without GPU costs.

Now I'm ready to draft and post the comprehensive review.

  "text": "[severity: critical + warning + info] Final Polish 审查 + Claim 强度评估 + cuda:1 建议\n\n---\n\n## Part 1: 逐段打磨\n\n### [severity: critical] Abstract vs §5 轴数不一致\n\n**abstract.tex L6**: \"Systematic generalization across **eight** axes\"\n**generalization.tex L4**: \"We test whether atlas accuracy reflects genuine statistical regularities across **seven** generalization axes (four below, three in Appendix).\"\n\nAbstract 改了 \"eight\"，但正文第一行还是 \"seven\"。审稿人一翻到 §5 就会发现这个矛盾。**必须统一**。\n\n---\n\n### [severity: warning] AI 写作痕迹：\", confirming/indicating/suggesting...\" 分词短语\n\n全文 54 处 participial phrase pattern（\", confirming that...\" / \", indicating ...\" / \", establishing ...\" / \", suggesting ...\" 等）。主文 ~30 处，附录 ~22 处。这是 AI 生成文本最典型的句式标志之一（paper-writing-norms §5.3 明确禁止 \"-ing 短语结尾\"）。\n\n**主文高频示例**（仅列 10 处，实际更多）：\n- atlas.tex L35: \"...confirming that human-written text is trivially separable\"\n- atlas.tex L123: \"...indicating accelerating convergence toward indistinguishability\"\n- atlas.tex L130: \"...establishing a consistent depth-4 decay boundary\"\n- atlas.tex L170: \"...amplifying the statistical fingerprint...causing cross-strategy classifiers to systematically overpredict\"\n- generalization.tex L14: \"...confirming depth signal resides in distributional statistics\"\n- generalization.tex L34: \"...confirming that ordinal depth estimation requires\"\n- method.tex L36: \"...ensuring cross-validation splits do not introduce information leakage\"\n- conclusion.tex L46: \"...confirming partial signal...underscoring that surprisal-based features are essential\"\n- conclusion.tex L50: \"...confirming depth signal is inherent to the recursive process\"\n- introduction.tex L32: \"...confirming the signal resides in distributional statistics\"\n\n**修复方式**：逐个改写为独立句或用逗号/括号重组。例如：\n- \"...ensuring cross-validation splits do not introduce leakage\" → \"; cross-validation splits therefore cannot leak information\"\n- \"...confirming that depth signal resides in distributional statistics\" → \". Depth signal thus resides in distributional statistics.\"\n\n**建议**：Paper Agent 一轮专项 pass，`grep -n \"confirming\\|indicating\\|establishing\\|suggesting\\|reflecting\\|supporting\\|underscoring\\|attenuating\\|placing\\|ensuring\\|avoiding\\|isolating\" *.tex` 逐个改写。\n\n---\n\n### [severity: info] 其他 AI 痕迹：已清零\n\n- Em-dash (—): 0 处 ✓\n- 解释性 en-dash ( – ): 0 处 ✓\n- Furthermore/Moreover/Additionally/Notably: 0 处 ✓\n- 黑名单词汇 (delve/leverage/utilize/facilitate/myriad/plethora): 0 处 ✓\n- 段落过度分段: 未发现 ✓\n\n---\n\n### [severity: warning] Discussion 极度单薄\n\ndiscussion.tex 全文仅 6 行（3 句话），内容是：重述结论 + LoRA loss 单调递减 + \"cross-strategy and depth-quality entanglement remain open\"。\n\nLimitations section（conclusion.tex）很详尽（56 行），但 Discussion 部分缺少：\n- 对 model collapse 缓解策略的实际意义讨论\n- 对数据治理/data provenance 的实践价值\n- 与理论预测的对比（Dohmatob tail erosion 预测 vs 实测 non-uniform contraction）\n- Future work 段（不只是 limitations 罗列）\n\n**建议**：Discussion 扩充至 8-12 行，增加 \"Practical Implications\" 段落（depth-graduated data curation，paper_framing.md Claim 4 已有素材）和 \"Connections to Theory\" 段落。\n\n---\n\n### [severity: info] 数字一致性：全部通过\n\n抽查所有关键数字 vs registry/results_summary.json：\n- 69-86% 范围 ✓ (68.8→85.9%)\n- EDD=4 ✓\n- 66.4% cross-model ✓\n- 2.7× chance ✓ (66.4/25=2.656)\n- 59.1% cross-strategy ✓\n- 69.5% prompted gen ✓ (69.52% 四舍五入)\n- 30-36% zero-shot ✓\n- 97.6% top-5 retention ✓ (76.5/78.4)\n- 43pp gap ✓ (78.7-36.2=42.5≈43)\n\n---\n\n## Part 2: Claim 强度最大化\n\n### [severity: warning] 4 处 underclaim\n\n**A. Cross-model chains 84.75% 未被充分利用**\n这是所有 transfer 实验中的最高准确率（超越大多数 in-distribution 设置），强力证明 depth signal 与具体模型架构无关。当前仅在 generalization.tex L105 一笔带过（\"Cross-model chains (84.75%)\"）。建议在 §5.2 cross-model transfer 增加一段，或在 contribution 列表中凸显。\n\n**B. Two-stage pipeline (+11.5pp) 困在 Limitations**\nconclusion.tex L10 把两阶段管道作为 Limitation 的解法提出，但 +11.5pp 是一个 positive contribution。建议在 §5.3 cross-strategy 结尾增加一段正面描述（\"a two-stage pipeline recovers...\"），Limitations 只保留残差问题。paper_framing.md Claim 3 已有完整素材。\n\n**C. Instruct regularization: base vs instruct 对比是干净的机制发现**\nbase (59.9%, non-monotonic AUC) vs instruct (70.2%, monotonic AUC) 是本文最干净的机制对比之一。当前 introduction.tex L16 只用一句带过 \"suggesting that instruction tuning acts as a regularizer\"。建议在 §5.4 Cross-Scale 或 Discussion 中展开 2-3 句，强化这个 mechanistic insight。\n\n**D. LoRA loss 单调递减可以更好利用**\ndiscussion.tex L5 提到 LoRA finetune loss 单调递减 \"supporting model collapse theory\"。这是 Dohmatob et al. (2024) 理论预测的直接实证验证。如果 Discussion 扩充（见上文建议），这个点可以成为 \"Connections to Theory\" 段落的核心论据。\n\n---\n\n## Part 3: cuda:1 空闲实验建议\n\n### Must-do (不需要 GPU)\n\n| 任务 | 耗时 | Priority |\n|------|------|----------|\n| 修复 \"seven\"→\"eight\" 不一致 | 5 min | **must-do** |\n| -ing phrase 全文改写 pass | 1-2h Paper Agent | **must-do** |\n| Discussion 扩充 | 30 min Paper Agent | **must-do** |\n\n### Nice-to-have (需 GPU, <4h)\n\n| 任务 | 耗时 | Priority | 价值 |\n|------|------|----------|------|\n| **第二模型 seed 复制**（OLMo or GPT-2 XL, seed=43）| ~3h cuda:1 | nice-to-have | 当前仅 Pythia 有 seed replication，加一个模型大幅增强 \"not seed-specific\" claim |\n| **Cross-model transfer 的 reference model ablation** | ~1h (仅 RF 训练) | nice-to-have | 检验 Pythia reference 是否在 transfer 场景也最优，无需重新生成数据 |\n\n### Nice-to-have (无 GPU, 需 API)\n\n| 任务 | 耗时 | Priority | 价值 |\n|------|------|----------|------|\n| **Gemini Flash 替代 GPT-4o-mini** 做 API model 递归链 | 2-4h API cost | nice-to-have | 完全不同架构 + API-only model，填补 plan_026 空缺。但需要 Director 评估 API key 可用性 |\n\n### 不推荐（ROI 低或时间风险）\n\n- 7B 样本量扩充（500→2000）: 需完整 QLoRA pipeline，>8h，来不及\n- Mixed-depth document simulation: 设计复杂度高，不适合 deadline 前抢跑\n- 额外 decoding strategy (beam search, contrastive): 需完整 pipeline，>12h\n\n---\n\n**总结优先级排序**：\n1. ⚡ 修 \"seven\"→\"eight\"（5 min，critical）\n2. ⚡ -ing phrase 清扫（1-2h，high severity AI 痕迹）\n3. ⚡ Discussion 扩充（30 min）\n4. ⚡ underclaim 修复 A-D（Paper Agent 同步做）\n5. 🔄 如果 cuda:1 确实空闲，第二模型 seed replication 是 ROI 最高的补充实验",

### Assistant

<details><summary>Logged reasoning block</summary>

```text
This is a thorough ARR checklist review by the worker. Let me assess the findings:

Key findings:
1. **Reproducibility section missing** - ❌ No compute budget, hardware specs, library versions, hyperparameter search strategy
2. **AI Assistant disclosure (E1)** - ❌ If AI-assisted writing/coding was used, needs disclosure in checklist
3. **Page count** - ⚠️ ~8 pages estimated, needs compilation to confirm
4. **Ethics Statement** - ✅ Good
5. **Limitations** - ✅ Very thorough


6. **Anonymization** - ✅ Clean
7. **Line numbers** - ✅ review mode enabled

The reproducibility gap is a legitimate compliance issue, and the E1 disclosure is particularly relevant since this work was created by AI agents. I'm verifying the key claims now—the ethics statement is confirmed in the conclusion, anonymization uses the proper LaTeX settings, and the worker correctly identified the missing compute budget and hardware specifications. Let me check the main document setup to confirm the anonymization and page configuration before finalizing my assessment.

Good. Let me verify a few things:
1. `\usepackage[review]{acl}` ✓ - review mode with line numbers
2. `\author{Anonymous}` ✓ - anonymized
3. Main text includes: abstract, introduction, related_work, method, atlas, generalization, discussion, conclusion
4. Then bibliography, then appendix

The worker's findings look accurate. Key issues to flag:
1. **Reproducibility** - Missing compute budget, hardware, library versions. This is important for ARR C1/C2/C4.


2. **E1 AI disclosure** - The paper was written by AI agents, which requires disclosure on OpenReview, though not necessarily in the paper itself.
3. **Page count** - Around 8 pages at the limit, so I need to verify the compiled output fits within constraints.

Let me check if the appendix contains any reproducibility details like hardware specs or compute information.

Confirmed: no mention of compute budget, GPU type, library versions anywhere in the paper. The only "GPU" reference is in the introduction contribution bullet about "GPU-free inference."

This is a genuine gap for ARR checklist compliance. C1 asks for model parameter counts, compute budget, and infrastructure. C4 asks for implementation details of external packages.

Let me post my review of this worker result.

<details><summary>Logged reasoning block</summary>

```text
This is a very thorough format check. Let me review the key findings:

### Critical/Important findings:
1. **RF tree count inconsistency**: method.tex says 200 trees, appendix says 100 trees (scikit-learn defaults). This is a factual inconsistency that a reviewer would catch.
2. **Punctuation errors in conclusion.tex**: "), ;" appears twice — a clear typo.
3. **Uncited bib entries for models/datasets actually used**: llama3, qwen2.5, penedo2024_fineweb — these models/datasets are mentioned in text but not cited. 

A reviewer would definitely flag these missing citations, along with several other formatting inconsistencies: the same feature names are formatted with different commands across sections, venue names vary in the bibliography, and preprint entries use different formats.

### Minor findings:
5. **Venue name inconsistency in bib**: Findings series written differently
6. **arXiv preprint format inconsistency**: Some use @article, some use @misc
7. **Spotlight notation inconsistency**: booktitle vs note field
8. **One title lacking double-brace protection**: mccullagh1980_ordinal
9. **Key-year mismatch**: tulchinskii2024_intrinsic_dim is actually 2023
10. **Unreferenced append**

Now I'm deciding which issues are critical enough to escalate to the Director. The random forest tree count discrepancy between 200 and 100 is the most serious since it directly impacts reproducibility and is exactly what reviewers scrutinize. The missing citations for llama3, qwen2.5, and FineWeb are equally important to address.

42	For the Pythia pipeline this constitutes self-model feature extraction, while OLMo and GPT-2~XL measurements are cross-model.
43	Empirically, the self-model configuration does not yield the highest accuracy (Pythia 78.7\% vs.\ GPT-2~XL 85.9\%), ; the overlap therefore does not confer a systematic advantage.
44	An ablation with OLMo-1B and GPT-2 XL as alternative references shows accuracy ranging from 67--79\% across three reference architectures (Appendix~\ref{app:ref_ablation}), all exceeding $2.5\times$ chance; same-family reference yields optimal performance ($\Delta{\leq}$11\,pp).
45	The choice of reference model affects feature values; a different reference model may shift absolute feature magnitudes and potentially alter discriminability at depth boundaries.
46	Reference-free surface features alone achieve 53.7\% (partial signal in lexical statistics) but trail the full pipeline by 25pp; surprisal-based features are therefore essential.
47	Simple multi-reference ensembling does not outperform the best single reference (73.7\% vs.\ 78.6\%).
48	
49	\paragraph{Single LoRA instance.}
50	Independent replication with seed=43 yields 77.15\% (95\% CI [76.4, 78.15], $\Delta{=}{-}1.05$\,pp vs.\ baseline); cross-seed transfer retains 76.76\% ($\Delta{=}{-}1.30$\,pp vs.\ within-seed avg), ; depth signal is thus inherent to the recursive process rather than specific LoRA weights (Appendix~\ref{app:seed_replication}).
51	Top-5 feature importance is identical across seeds.

Confirmed:
1. **conclusion.tex L43**: "), ; the overlap" — comma-semicolon double punctuation
2. **conclusion.tex L50**: "), ; depth signal" — same issue
3. **section_appendix.tex L681**: "scikit-learn defaults (100 trees)" vs method.tex L103 "Random Forest (200 trees)"

The tree count inconsistency is important. The question is: which is correct? method.tex says 200 trees for the primary classifier, appendix says 100 trees (scikit-learn defaults). If they actually used 200 trees, then the appendix description "scikit-learn defaults (100 trees)" is wrong. 

But if they used 100 trees instead, then method.tex is incorrect—either way, this is a reproducibility issue. And there's another layer: method.tex L85 mentions 500 trees for the binary classifiers in EDD computation, so I'm seeing three different tree counts across the document (200, 500, and 100), with the 200 versus 100 discrepancy being the main problem.

### Assistant

<details><summary>Logged reasoning block</summary>

```text
Good. The worker clarified the situation:

- **Main pipeline uses n_estimators=200** (the majority of production scripts in `src/` and later `scripts/`)
- **Early MVP scripts still use 100** (the `scripts/train_classifier.py` etc.)
- **Granularity ablation / EDD bootstrap uses 500** (specialized binary classifiers)

So:
- **method.tex L103 "200 trees"** is CORRECT for the primary classifier
- **section_appendix.tex L681 "scikit-learn defaults (100 trees)"** is WRONG — should say 200 trees, and it's not "scikit-learn defaults" since the default is 100 but they actually use 200


- The appendix needs to be fixed to match the actual implementation and method.tex, then I'll update the Director.
