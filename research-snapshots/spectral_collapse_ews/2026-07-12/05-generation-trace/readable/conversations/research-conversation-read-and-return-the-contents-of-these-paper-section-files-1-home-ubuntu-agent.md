2	Synthetic data has become integral to language model training.
3	Instruction tuning, knowledge distillation, and data augmentation all routinely use model-generated text, and as synthetic corpora are recycled into training pipelines, the process often becomes recursive: each generation of models is fine-tuned on outputs from the previous one.
4	Recent work demonstrates that such recursive synthetic training triggers \textit{model collapse}, a progressive erosion of distributional tails and downstream capability~\citep{shumailov2024collapse, dohmatob2024tails, dohmatob2024demystified, alemohammad2024mad}.
5	The problem is especially pressing as web-scraped corpora increasingly contain model-generated content~\citep{dohmatob2025strong}, a trend that introduces implicit recursive loops even without deliberate data reuse.
6	
7	While model collapse is now well-characterized through theoretical analysis~\citep{dohmatob2024tails, seddik2024synthetic} and empirical studies~\citep{shumailov2024collapse, alemohammad2024mad, gerstgrasser2024inevitable}, its effect on the geometric structure of learned representations~\citep{ethayarajh2019contextual, martin2021implicit} remains poorly understood.
8	Characterizing how the embedding space contracts during recursive training could yield computationally cheap collapse indicators from internal model states alone, without text generation or benchmark evaluation.
9	
10	Current collapse detection depends on downstream metrics such as perplexity and benchmark accuracy, or on analysis of generated text through lexical diversity measures.
11	Both approaches require either costly inference or external evaluation infrastructure at every generation.
12	SIGMA~\citep{gu2026sigma} introduced spectral monitoring through embedding covariance analysis and showed that spectral indicators can track collapse, but validated only on OPT-125M over short generation horizons.
13	Four gaps remain open.
14	First, although spectral collapse has been linked to plasticity loss~\citep{he2025spectral} and rank collapse observed in attention layers~\citep{naderi2025mindgap}, no work has characterized spectral dynamics in recursive training beyond a few generations.
15	Second, the temporal relationship between spectral indicators and downstream degradation has not been examined.
16	Third, no study has connected spectral indicators to closed-loop collapse prevention through the lens of early warning signals (EWS)~\citep{scheffer2009ews, scheffer2012anticipating}.
17	Fourth, while data mixing strategies are well-studied for pretraining~\citep{longpre2024pretrainer, xie2023doremi}, the relationship between real-data mixing ratios and spectral collapse has not been mapped: it is unknown how much real data suffices to prevent spectral contraction, or whether a sharp phase boundary exists.
18	
19	We address these gaps by tracking spectral indicators of the embedding matrix across 10 recursive generations of Pythia-410M-deduped~\citep{biderman2023pythia}, with pilot validation on Pythia-1B-deduped and cross-architecture confirmation on GPT-2-medium~\citep{radford2019language}.
20	Our analysis reveals a reproducible three-phase pattern (Figure~\ref{fig:spectral_trajectory}): spectral decompression (Gen~0--2), where effective rank ($r_{\text{eff}}$)~\citep{roy2007effectiverank} and spectral log-volume (SLV) rise while downstream performance already declines; collapse onset (Gen~2--4), where spectral indicators reverse; and accelerating collapse (Gen~4--10), where contraction accelerates.
21	Among these indicators, SLV is the most effective collapse indicator: it requires only a forward pass on held-out data (no text generation), captures distributed volume changes across all spectral directions, and declines monotonically after its peak.
22	We further design a proportional controller as a testbed for reactive collapse prevention, and find that it exposes an inherent signal attenuation: the rate-based spectral signal degrades continuously as the real-data fraction increases and vanishes entirely above $r_{\text{crit}}$; any reactive spectral controller is therefore ineffective in the regime where prevention succeeds.
23	
24	Our contributions are:
25	\begin{itemize}
26	\item \textbf{C1:} The first multi-seed spectral-downstream characterization over 10 recursive generations, which reveals dynamics invisible in prior short-horizon studies and establishes a reproducible three-phase collapse pattern (decompression, onset, acceleration) (\S\ref{subsec:phase0}, Table~\ref{tab:phase0}).
27	\item \textbf{C2:} SLV as a computationally cheap collapse indicator with monotonic post-peak decline and a HellaSwag-spectral asymmetry: downstream degradation begins during the spectral decompression phase, so spectral expansion does not indicate model health (\S\ref{subsec:phase0}, \S\ref{subsec:alt_ews}).
28	\item \textbf{C3:} Quantitative characterization of signal attenuation under mixing: the spectral controller signal degrades continuously as the real-data fraction approaches $r_{\text{crit}}$ and vanishes entirely above it, a limitation robust to threshold reduction (\S\ref{subsec:controller}, \S\ref{subsec:phase1}).
29	\end{itemize}
30	Supporting these findings, we construct a spectral collapse trajectory map across multiple mixing ratios that localizes $r_{\text{crit}}$ empirically, with the bound robust to both the EMA smoothing parameter and random seed (\S\ref{subsec:phase_diagram}, \S\ref{subsec:phase1}, \S\ref{subsec:phase_diagram_exp}), and provide preliminary cross-architecture evidence that the three-phase trajectory generalizes to GPT-2-medium (\S\ref{subsec:cross_arch}).

Under 50\% mixing, SLV rises monotonically (except a negligible Gen~1 dip) to 2572 at Gen~10, 8.7\% above baseline and 104 points above the pure-collapse peak.}

1	\subsection{Spectral Metrics}
2	\label{subsec:spectral_metrics}
3	
4	Given a language model at generation $t$, we extract last-layer embeddings for $n{=}1{,}000$ held-out samples to form $\mathbf{E} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$.
5	Let $\sigma_1 \geq \sigma_2 \geq \cdots \geq \sigma_{\min(n,d)}$ denote the singular values of $\mathbf{E}$.
6	We track three complementary spectral indicators:
7	
8	\paragraph{Spectral Log-Volume (SLV).}
9	$\text{SLV} = \sum_{i:\,\sigma_i > \epsilon} \log \sigma_i$, where $\epsilon = 10^{-10}$ excludes numerically zero components.
10	When $n < d$ (as in our setting with $n{=}1{,}000$, $d{=}1{,}024$), $\mathbf{E}$ has at most $n$ non-zero singular values; SLV thus measures the log-volume of the occupied subspace rather than the full $d$-dimensional space.
11	Because it sums over all non-negligible singular values, SLV is sensitive to contraction along any spectral direction, not only the dominant ones.
12	
13	\paragraph{Finite-Sample Considerations.}
14	Our aspect ratio $\gamma = n/d = 1000/1024 \approx 0.98$ falls in the regime where Marchenko--Pastur (MP) theory~\citep{bai2010spectral} predicts systematic bias in spectral statistics, but since $\gamma$ is constant across all conditions, this bias cancels in cross-generation comparisons.
15	Empirically, the three-phase trajectory is stable across $n \in \{250, 5000\}$ (SLV CV $< 0.4\%$; see Limitations); the smallest observed singular value ($0.016$, GPT-2-medium Gen~10) remains eight orders of magnitude above $\epsilon$.
16	
17	\paragraph{Effective Rank.}
18	$r_{\text{eff}} = \exp(H(\mathbf{p}))$, where $p_i = \sigma_i / \sum_j \sigma_j$ and $H$ is the Shannon entropy, measuring how many dimensions carry substantial variance (uniform $\to \min(n,d)$, concentrated $\to 1$).
19	
20	\paragraph{Leading Singular Value.}
21	$\sigma_1$ tracks the dominant spectral direction; rising $\sigma_1$ under falling $r_{\text{eff}}$ signals representational collapse into a low-dimensional subspace.

PPL = perplexity, HeSw = HellaSwag accuracy (0-shot), D-4 = distinct-4. Bold marks the spectral peak.}

40	\end{table}
41	
42	\subsection{Adaptive Mixing Controller}
43	\label{subsec:controller}
44	
45	To test whether spectral rate-of-change signals can drive automated collapse prevention, we design a closed-loop controller that adjusts the real-data mixing ratio $r_t$ at each generation.
46	The update rule is:
47	\begin{equation}
48	\label{eq:controller}
49	r_{t+1} = \operatorname{clip}\!\bigl(\tfrac{B_{\text{rem}}}{T - t} + k \cdot \max(0,\,\Delta_t - \tau),\; r_{\min},\, r_{\max}\bigr)
50	\end{equation}
51	where $B_{\text{rem}}$ is the remaining real-data budget (fraction of total budget not yet consumed), $T$ is the total number of generations, $\tau{=}0.002$ is a sensitivity threshold, and $k{=}10$ is the controller gain.
52	The signal $\Delta_t$ is the baseline-normalized SLV drop: $\Delta_t = (\widetilde{S}_{t-1} - \widetilde{S}_t) / |\widetilde{S}_0|$, where $\widetilde{S}_t$ is the exponential moving average (EMA)-smoothed SLV ($\alpha{=}0.5$) and $\widetilde{S}_0$ is initialized from the pretrained model (Gen~0, SLV${=}2366.68$).
53	The signed form ensures that spectral decompression ($\Delta_t < 0$) does not trigger the controller; only contraction activates the $\max(0, \cdot)$ gate in Eq.~\ref{eq:controller}.
54	The output is clipped to $[r_{\min}, r_{\max}] = [0.20, 0.80]$ and subject to $\sum_t r_t \leq B_{\text{total}}$.
55	The lower bound ensures a minimum synthetic fraction; $r_{\max}$ defines the controller's operational range.
56	
57	The first term distributes the remaining budget uniformly; the second injects additional real data proportional to spectral contraction severity.
58	We set $\tau{=}0.002$ as the smallest threshold avoiding false activation during decompression, and $k{=}10$ so that a moderate signal adds approximately 2 percentage points of additional real data.
59	
60	\paragraph{Controller Silence Condition.}
61	Define $r_{\text{crit}}$ as the minimum constant mixing ratio such that, within $T{=}10$ generations, the EMA-smoothed SLV is non-decreasing from the second generation onward: $\widetilde{S}_t \geq \widetilde{S}_{t-1}$ for all $t \in \{2, \ldots, T\}$ (excluding the initial fine-tuning transient at $t{=}1$). For conditions with multiple seeds, the condition is evaluated on the cross-seed mean trajectory.
62	When a constant ratio $r \geq r_{\text{crit}}$ is applied, $\Delta_t \leq 0 < \tau$ for all $t \geq 2$ and any $\tau > 0$, so the controller boost is identically zero.
63	This $\tau$-independence means the signal attenuation cannot be resolved by lowering the sensitivity threshold; the same argument extends to cumulative variants.
64	Our experiments (\S\ref{subsec:phase1}) empirically bound $0.25 < r_{\text{crit}} \leq 0.3$ over Gen~2--10 for Pythia-410M on OpenWebText.
65	
66	\paragraph{Second-Order Extension.}
67	\label{subsec:second_order}
68	A natural extension monitors the rate of change of the controller signal itself:
69	\begin{equation}
70	\label{eq:second_order}
71	\Delta^2_t = \widetilde{\Delta}_{t-1} - \widetilde{\Delta}_t
72	\end{equation}
73	where $\widetilde{\Delta}_t$ is the EMA-smoothed first-order signal ($\alpha_2{=}0.3$).
74	A sustained negative $\Delta^2_t$ indicates decelerating SLV growth, a potential precursor to stagnation even when SLV is still rising.
75	We evaluate this indicator in \S\ref{subsec:phase_diagram_exp}.
76	
77	\subsection{Collapse Trajectory Classification}
78	\label{subsec:phase_diagram}
79	
80	We define the \emph{collapse trajectory map} as the mapping from constant mixing ratio $r$ to the SLV trajectory over $T$ generations, classifying outcomes as \emph{collapse} (monotonic post-decompression decline), \emph{stable} (non-decreasing), or \emph{transitional} (non-monotonic after Gen~2).
81	We estimate $r_{\text{crit}}$ by identifying the lowest $r$ for which $\widetilde{S}_t \geq \widetilde{S}_{t-1}$ holds for all $t \in \{2, \ldots, T\}$.
82

2	\subsection{Experimental Setup}
3	\label{subsec:setup}
4	
5	We use the publicly released final Pythia-410M-deduped checkpoint \citep{biderman2023pythia} as our base model and fine-tune on a randomly sampled 50K-subset of OpenWebText (filtered to sequences with $\geq$256 non-padding tokens).
6	Starting from the pretrained checkpoint (generation~0), each subsequent generation fine-tunes on synthetic text produced by the previous generation, for a total of 10 recursive generations.
7	At each generation we compute the spectral indicators from \S\ref{subsec:spectral_metrics} on 1K held-out last-layer embeddings, paired with three downstream metrics: perplexity, HellaSwag accuracy (0-shot), and distinct-4.
8	These three metrics (language modeling capability, natural language understanding, and generation diversity) cover the primary evaluation dimensions accessible to a 410M-parameter model.
9	Training hyperparameters and compute details are in Appendix~\ref{app:training_details}.
10	
11	For the mixing comparison (\S\ref{subsec:phase1}), we evaluate three strategies:
12	(1)~\textbf{pure collapse} ($r_t{=}0$),
13	(2)~\textbf{fixed mix} ($r_t{=}0.50$), and
14	(3)~\textbf{adaptive} ($k{=}10$, Eq.~\ref{eq:controller}).
15	To construct the collapse trajectory map (\S\ref{subsec:phase_diagram_exp}), we additionally evaluate fixed mixing at $r \in \{0.2, 0.25, 0.3\}$.
16	
17	\subsection{Spectral Collapse Characterization}
18	\label{subsec:phase0}
19	
20	Table~\ref{tab:phase0} reports spectral and downstream metrics across 10 recursive generations, which reveal a three-phase structure.
21	
22	\paragraph{Phase I: Spectral Decompression (Gen~0--2).}
23	$r_{\text{eff}}$ rises from 417.55 to 496.2 (+18.8\%) and SLV from 2366.7 to 2468.0 (+4.3\%), while $\sigma_1$ drops from 1942.8 to 718.7.
24	The peak at Gen~2 is consistent across all three seeds (Figure~\ref{fig:seed_variability}; SLV coefficient of variation (CV) $< 1.3\%$ at all generations; full per-generation statistics in Appendix Table~\ref{tab:pergen_variance}).
25	However, this decompression does not indicate improved model quality: HellaSwag drops 8.0\% and distinct-4 falls 31.6\% during the same interval (Figure~\ref{fig:slv_ppl_decoupling}), and SLV computation takes ${<}\,1$\,s vs.\ ${\sim}$70\,min for benchmarks.
26	
27	\begin{figure}[t]
28	\centering
29	\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figures/seed_variability.pdf}
30	\caption{Cross-seed reproducibility of SLV under pure-synthetic training ($r{=}0$). Thin lines: individual seeds (42, 43, 44); thick line: 3-seed mean; shaded band: $\pm$1 s.d. The coefficient of variation remains below 1.3\% at all generations; spectral collapse follows a deterministic trajectory.}
31	\label{fig:seed_variability}
32	\end{figure}
33	
34	\begin{figure}[t]
35	\centering
36	\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figures/slv_ppl_decoupling.pdf}
37	\caption{SLV (top) and perplexity (bottom) across 10 recursive generations ($r{=}0$, 3-seed mean). In Phase~I (Gen~0--2), both metrics rise simultaneously. The SLV increase reflects distributional broadening, not model health. From Phase~III onward (Gen~4--10), the two metrics diverge: SLV declines monotonically while perplexity accelerates, which confirms that post-decompression SLV faithfully tracks structural collapse.}
38	\label{fig:slv_ppl_decoupling}
39	\end{figure}
40	
41	\paragraph{Phase II: Collapse Onset (Gen~2--4).}
42	Both $r_{\text{eff}}$ and SLV reverse after Gen~2 ($r_{\text{eff}}$: 496.2$\to$493.6, SLV: 2468$\to$2440), marking the transition from decompression to collapse while perplexity continues its monotonic rise.
43	SLV's post-peak decline is sharper than $r_{\text{eff}}$'s ($-$1.1\% vs.\ $-$0.5\% in the first post-peak generation) because SLV captures distributed contraction across all spectral directions rather than the dominant ones alone.
44	At 1B scale, this sensitivity gap widens to a timing difference: SLV peaks one generation earlier than $r_{\text{eff}}$ (see Cross-Scale Pilot below).
45	
46	\paragraph{Phase III: Accelerating Collapse (Gen~4--10).}
47	SLV contraction accelerates: the per-generation decline averages $-$31.0 during onset (Gen~2--4) vs.\ $-$37.4 during acceleration (Gen~4--10), with 78\% of the total peak-to-final decline occurring in Phase~III (Table~\ref{tab:pergen_variance}).
48	By Gen~10, $r_{\text{eff}}$ falls to 438.1 ($-$11.7\% from peak), SLV to 2181.4 ($-$11.6\% from peak), and perplexity reaches 71.0 ($+$643\%).
49	Concurrently, $\sigma_1$ traces a U-shaped trajectory: after dropping from 1942.8 to 718.7 during decompression, it rises to 874.6 by Gen~10 (Figure~\ref{fig:spectral_trajectory}).
50	This simultaneous $\sigma_1$ recovery and $r_{\text{eff}}$ decline is a geometric signature of mode collapse: representations concentrate along fewer dominant directions while the overall occupied volume shrinks.
51	
52	\paragraph{Cross-Scale Pilot.}
53	Repeating the protocol on Pythia-1B-deduped (Gen~0--3) reproduces the decompression-onset structure: SLV rises from 2835 to 2906 at Gen~1 ($+$2.5\%) before declining to 2865 at Gen~3, while $r_{\text{eff}}$ peaks one generation later at Gen~2 (580.9 vs.\ 570.8 at Gen~1).
54	This one-generation SLV lead over $r_{\text{eff}}$ (absent at 410M, where both peak simultaneously) suggests that SLV sensitivity increases with model scale.
55	Perplexity rises monotonically throughout (8.1$\to$13.4, $+$66\%)---the same downstream-spectral asymmetry observed at 410M scale.
56	Full 10-generation characterization at 1B remains future work.
57	
58	\subsection{Adaptive Mixing Comparison}
59	\label{subsec:phase1}
60	
61	We evaluate the controller retrospectively by computing its signal on pre-existing fixed-ratio trajectories rather than deploying it in a closed loop; the goal is to characterize signal attenuation, not to propose operational deployment.
62	Under pure synthetic training, SLV peaks at Gen~2 (2468) and declines monotonically; with 50\% mixing, SLV rises to 2572 at Gen~10, with only a negligible Gen~1 dip ($\Delta_1 \approx 0.0005$, well below $\tau$).
63	The adaptive controller ($k{=}10$) remains silent through all ten generations.
64	Figure~\ref{fig:controller_signal} quantifies the signal attenuation: the maximum controller signal magnitude drops from 40.4 at $r{=}0$ to 3.8 at $r{=}0.2$ and reaches exactly zero at $r \geq 0.3$. Even moderate mixing suffices to suppress the rate-based signal~\citep{scheffer2009ews}.
65	
66	\begin{figure}[t]
67	\centering
68	\includegraphics[width=0.85\columnwidth]{figures/controller_signal.pdf}
69	\caption{Maximum controller signal magnitude ($\max|\Delta\tilde{S}_t|$, $t \geq 2$) across mixing ratios. The signal drops $10\times$ from $r{=}0$ to $r{=}0.2$ and is exactly zero for $r \geq 0.3$ (``silent''), rate-based controllers are therefore ineffective.}
70	\label{fig:controller_signal}
71	\end{figure}
72	
73	Despite sustained spectral expansion at $r{=}0.5$, downstream metrics degrade: perplexity increases 58\% and distinct-4 falls to .152 (below even pure collapse), reinforcing that spectral health does not guarantee model health.
74	
75	\subsection{Alternative EWS Comparison}
76	\label{subsec:alt_ews}
77	
78	We compare SLV against seven alternative collapse indicators from three signal sources: embedding geometry (RankMe, isotropy), attention weights (stable rank, spectral norm), and output distributions (token entropy, raw perplexity, perplexity growth rate).
79	
80	Table~\ref{tab:ews_main} summarizes the comparison under pure-synthetic training ($r{=}0$); full tabular data appear in Appendix Table~\ref{tab:ews_comparison}.
81	Only SLV and RankMe~\citep{rankme2023} exhibit a decompression peak at Gen~2 followed by monotonic decline; all other indicators change monotonically from Gen~0 and cannot distinguish collapse onset from the initial fine-tuning transient.
82	SLV's signal-to-noise ratio is 2.5$\times$ that of RankMe (11.8\% vs.\ 4.7\% relative change).
83	
84	\begin{table}[t]
85	\centering
86	\small
87	\setlength{\tabcolsep}{4pt}
88	\begin{tabular}{@{}llcc@{}}
89	\toprule
90	Indicator & Direction ($r{=}0$) & Rel $\Delta$ & Rev. \\
91	\midrule
92	SLV         & Peak G2, mono.\ $\downarrow$ & 11.8\% & \checkmark \\
93	RankMe      & Peak G2, mono.\ $\downarrow$ &  4.7\% & \checkmark \\
94	Token ent.  & Mono.\ $\downarrow$           &  9.6\% & \checkmark \\
95	Stable rank & Mono.\ $\downarrow$           & 14.0\% & \checkmark \\

99	PPL growth  & ${\sim}$Mono.\ $\downarrow$   &  ---   & \checkmark \\
100	\bottomrule
101	\end{tabular}
102	\caption{Eight EWS indicators under pure-synthetic training ($r{=}0$, Pythia-410M). \textbf{Direction}: trajectory shape (Peak G$n$ = decompression peak at generation $n$; mono.\ = monotonic post-peak or throughout). \textbf{Rel $\Delta$}: total relative change. \textbf{Rev.}: whether the indicator reverses under $r{=}0.5$ mixing. Seven of eight reverse; raw PPL is the sole exception. Full data in Appendix Table~\ref{tab:ews_comparison}.}
103	\label{tab:ews_main}
104	\end{table}
105	Seven of eight indicators reverse direction under mixing (Table~\ref{tab:ews_main}, last column); raw perplexity is the sole exception.
106	This near-universality confirms that signal attenuation is not specific to SLV: any rate-based controller will fall silent when mixing exceeds $r_{\text{crit}}$.
107	SLV is the only indicator that combines decompression-phase sensitivity, post-peak monotonicity, and sub-second computation cost; it shares a metric foundation with SIGMA's $\log\det G$ ($= 2 \times \text{SLV}$; \S\ref{sec:related}).
108	Raw perplexity is a stronger unconditional monitor (monotonic from Gen~0, no decompression mislead) but does not reveal the spectral geometry of collapse; SLV and PPL are complementary.
109	
110	\subsection{Collapse Trajectory Classification}
111	\label{subsec:phase_diagram_exp}
112	
113	We now map SLV trajectories across mixing ratios to construct the collapse trajectory map defined in \S\ref{subsec:phase_diagram}.
114	Figure~\ref{fig:phase_diagram} plots SLV across 10 recursive generations for five mixing ratios; three qualitatively distinct trajectory types emerge:
115	
116	\begin{figure}[t]
117	\centering
118	\includegraphics[width=0.92\columnwidth]{figures/phase_diagram.pdf}
119	\caption{SLV trajectories across mixing ratios (Pythia-410M; $r{=}0$, $r{=}0.2$, $r{=}0.25$, $r{=}0.3$: 3-seed mean, solid lines; $r{=}0.5$: 2-seed mean, dashed line). Type~I ($r{=}0$): decompression then monotonic collapse. Type~II ($r{=}0.2$, $r{=}0.25$): transient dip followed by recovery. Type~III ($r{=}0.3$, $r{=}0.5$): monotonic expansion from Gen~2 onward. The shaded band marks the critical threshold $r_{\text{crit}} \in (0.25, 0.3]$. The dashed horizontal line indicates the Gen~0 baseline.}
120	\label{fig:phase_diagram}
121	\end{figure}
122	
123	\paragraph{Type~I: Pure Collapse ($r{=}0$).}
124	SLV exhibits large decompression ($+$96 points at Gen~1, peaking at Gen~2) followed by accelerating contraction (\S\ref{subsec:phase0}).
125	
126	\paragraph{Type~II: Near-critical Mixing ($r{=}0.2$, $r{=}0.25$).}
127	At $r{=}0.2$, SLV dips $-7.3$ points at Gen~2 before recovering to 2467.2 at Gen~10 ($+4.3\%$ above baseline; full per-generation data in Appendix Table~\ref{tab:pergen_variance_r02}).
128	The EMA-smoothed SLV violates non-decreasing at Gen~2, placing $r{=}0.2$ below $r_{\text{crit}}$, yet the smoothed signal ($\max \Delta_t = 0.0016$, below $\tau{=}0.002$) fails to trigger the controller.
129	At $r{=}0.25$, the same pattern holds with a weaker dip ($-2.1$) and ${\sim}3\times$ weaker signal.
130	As Figure~\ref{fig:rankme_trajectories} shows, $r_{\text{eff}}$ rises monotonically for all $r \geq 0.2$, yielding only a 2-type classification (collapse vs.\ non-collapse); SLV's transient dip uniquely identifies the transitional regime.
131	
132	\begin{figure}[t]
133	\centering
134	\includegraphics[width=0.92\columnwidth]{figures/rankme_trajectories.pdf}
135	\caption{Effective rank ($r_{\mathrm{eff}}$) trajectories across mixing ratios. Unlike SLV (Figure~\ref{fig:phase_diagram}), $r_{\mathrm{eff}}$ rises monotonically for all $r \geq 0.2$, providing only a 2-type classification and failing to identify the Type~II transitional regime.}
136	\label{fig:rankme_trajectories}
137	\end{figure}
138	
139	\paragraph{Type~III: Super-critical Mixing ($r \geq 0.3$).}
140	SLV rises monotonically from Gen~2 onward.
141	At $r{=}0.3$, SLV reaches 2508.2 at Gen~10 ($+$6.0\% above baseline); at $r{=}0.5$, 2572 ($+$8.7\%).
142	The critical threshold is robust to EMA smoothing ($\alpha \in \{0.3, 0.5, 0.7\}$ all yield $r_{\text{crit}} \in (0.25, 0.3]$; Appendix Table~\ref{tab:alpha_robustness}), and the maximum SLV departure below baseline (multi-seed mean) shrinks continuously with $r$ ($-7.3$ at $r{=}0.2$, $-3.3$ at $r{=}0.25$, $-1.5$ at $r{=}0.3$), consistent with a continuous crossover.
143	$r_{\text{crit}}$ thus marks a transition in trajectory shape, not in final outcome: Type~II trajectories recover spectrally but exhibit an initial contraction transient that Type~III trajectories lack.
144	
145	\paragraph{Output Diversity Divergence.}
146	D-4 does not increase monotonically with $r$: it remains highest around $r \in \{0.2, 0.25\}$ (mean $.324$--$.342$, with high cross-seed variance s.d.\ $\approx 0.17$) before dropping to .152 at $r{=}0.5$: spectral expansion does not guarantee diversity.
147	D-4 also shows substantially higher cross-seed variance than SLV (CV $= 3.9\%$ vs.\ $0.12\%$ at $r{=}0.25$); the two metrics capture orthogonal aspects of model behavior.
148	
149	Table~\ref{tab:phase_summary} consolidates the final-generation metrics across all five mixing ratios.
150	
151	\paragraph{Practical Implications.}
152	Neither second-order acceleration ($\Delta^2_t$, Eq.~\ref{eq:second_order}) nor level-based triggers resolve the attenuation problem: $\Delta^2_t$ is negative in late generations regardless of $r$, and level-based triggers fail under Type~III.
153	The trajectory map provides a direct prescription: setting $r > 0.3$ prevents spectral collapse without per-generation monitoring.

174	\subsection{Cross-Architecture Validation}
175	\label{subsec:cross_arch}
176	
177	To test whether the three-phase trajectory generalizes beyond Pythia, we repeat the recursive pipeline on GPT-2-medium~\citep{radford2019language} (355M parameters, different pretraining corpus and tokenizer) under four conditions: pure synthetic ($r{=}0$, 9 generations), intermediate mixing ($r{=}0.25$ and $r{=}0.3$, 3 generations each), and a real-data control ($r{=}1.0$, 3 generations).
178	
179	Under pure synthetic training, GPT-2-medium reproduces the three-phase pattern (Table~\ref{tab:cross_arch}): SLV peaks at Gen~2 (924, $+$34.1\% from baseline) and declines to 415 by Gen~9 ($-$55.1\% from peak), while perplexity rises from 15.5 to 329 ($+$2028\%).
180	The $\sigma_1$ trajectory follows the same U-shape (6598$\to$1191 during decompression, rising to ${\sim}$1570 by Gen~9); dominant-direction reconcentration under falling effective rank is architecture-independent.
181	The collapse magnitude is substantially larger than Pythia's ($-$55.1\% vs.\ $-$11.6\% SLV decline), consistent with GPT-2-medium's more anisotropic initial spectrum ($r_{\text{eff}}{=}23$ vs.\ Pythia's 418).
182	
183	The real-data control ($r{=}1.0$) shows monotonic expansion with perplexity \emph{decreasing} ($-$27.4\%), which confirms that collapse is specific to recursive synthetic training.
184	
185	At intermediate ratios ($r{=}0.25$, $r{=}0.3$), both conditions reproduce the decompression phase (Gen~0$\to$1: SLV $+$7.5--8.5\%, $r_{\text{eff}}$ from 23 to 136--142, $\sigma_1$ $-$80--82\%) and stabilize through Gen~3, with EMA-smoothed SLV monotonically non-decreasing.
186	At $r{=}0.3$ this matches Pythia's Type~III classification.
187	At $r{=}0.25$, the three-generation window does not resolve the Type~II/III distinction, since Pythia's characteristic EMA dip appears only at Gen~5+; the trajectory is consistent with the Pythia-410M phase boundary but does not independently confirm $r_{\text{crit}}$ for this architecture.

2	The spectral decompression phase reflects fine-tuning's redistribution of variance: early recursive training compresses the dominant singular direction while inflating subordinate ones, an effect analogous to isotropy regularization~\citep{ethayarajh2019contextual} reversed by recursive amplification.
3	That downstream performance degrades during this expansion confirms these indicators are collapse detectors, not quality measures.
4	SLV and perplexity are complementary: perplexity rises monotonically from Gen~0; SLV provides mechanistic diagnosis by distinguishing volume contraction from distributional broadening.
5	
6	A key finding is the prevention--detectability tradeoff: real-data mixing reverses the spectral trajectory entirely, and the controller signal drops $10\times$ from $r{=}0$ to $r{=}0.2$ and vanishes at $r \geq 0.3$; no regime exists where prevention and detection coexist.
7	Our analysis identifies SLV as a cheap spectral indicator, reveals a reproducible three-phase collapse trajectory, and exposes the signal attenuation that limits reactive controllers.
8	The trajectory map localizes $r_{\text{crit}} \in (0.25, 0.3]$; setting $r > r_{\text{crit}}$ prevents collapse without per-generation monitoring, with cross-architecture support from GPT-2-medium and preliminary scale evidence from Pythia-1B.

1	\section*{Limitations}
2	
3	\paragraph{Scale and Scope.}
4	We validate at two model scales (Pythia-410M and a 1B pilot through Gen~3) with all spectral metrics computed from last-layer embeddings only; intermediate layers may exhibit different dynamics.
5	The 1B pilot confirms the decompression peak but is insufficient to characterize full acceleration or estimate $r_{\text{crit}}$ at that scale.
6	All fine-tuning uses a single domain (OpenWebText, English web text); spectral collapse dynamics may differ for code, multilingual, or domain-specific corpora.
7	
8	\paragraph{Temporal Horizon.}
9	Ten recursive generations may be shorter than production pipelines.
10	Type~II (transitional) trajectories may eventually revert to collapse at longer horizons, which would shift $r_{\text{crit}}$ upward.
11	The proportional controller uses a single gain $k$ without integral or derivative terms; a more sophisticated design might partially mitigate signal attenuation.
12	
13	\paragraph{Generalization.}
14	Signal attenuation may extend to implicit-loop settings where web corpora contain model-generated content, but validating this requires controlled experiments with web-scale data.
15	Our use of AI coding and writing assistants is disclosed in Appendix~\ref{app:ai-assistants}.

Here are the contents of all the paper section files:

## 1. introduction.tex

The introduction covers the motivation for studying model collapse in recursive synthetic training. It discusses:
- The prevalence of synthetic data in language model training through instruction tuning, knowledge distillation, and data augmentation
- Recent work on model collapse—a progressive erosion of distributional tails and downstream capability
- The problem of recursive loops from web-scraped corpora containing model-generated content
- Current collapse detection methods (downstream metrics, text analysis) being computationally expensive
- Four key gaps: lack of characterization beyond short horizons, unexplored temporal relationships between spectral indicators and degradation, missing connection to early warning signals (EWS), and unknown real-data mixing requirements
- The paper's contributions: a three-phase spectral pattern (decompression, onset, acceleration), SLV as a collapse indicator, signal attenuation analysis under mixing, and empirical bounds on the critical mixing ratio $r_{\text{crit}}$

## 2. method.tex

The method section describes:
- **Spectral Metrics**: Extraction of last-layer embeddings from 1,000 held-out samples to form a matrix. Three metrics are tracked:
  - Spectral Log-Volume (SLV): sum of log singular values, sensitive to contraction along any spectral direction
  - Effective Rank: measures how many dimensions carry substantial variance
  - Leading Singular Value: tracks the dominant spectral direction
- **Finite-Sample Considerations**: Discussion of Marchenko-Pastur theory and aspect ratio validation
- **Adaptive Mixing Controller**: A proportional controller that adjusts real-data mixing ratio based on SLV drop rate, with parameters for sensitivity threshold and gain
- **Controller Silence Condition**: Definition of $r_{\text{crit}}$ as the minimum constant mixing ratio preventing SLV decline
- **Collapse Trajectory Classification**: Mapping from mixing ratio to trajectory shape

## 3. experiments.tex (results.tex does not exist)

The experiments section contains:
- **Experimental Setup**: Use of Pythia-410M-deduped on OpenWebText subset, 10 recursive generations, three downstream metrics (perplexity, HellaSwag, distinct-4)
- **Spectral Collapse Characterization**: Three-phase structure:
  - Phase I (Gen 0-2): Spectral decompression—SLV and effective rank rise while HellaSwag drops
  - Phase II (Gen 2-4): Collapse onset—indicators reverse
  - Phase III (Gen 4-10): Accelerating collapse—sharp contraction
- **Adaptive Mixing Comparison**: Controller signal attenuation analysis showing signal drops 10× from r=0 to r=0.2 and reaches zero at r≥0.3
- **Alternative EWS Comparison**: SLV compared against 7 other indicators; only SLV and RankMe show decompression peak
- **Collapse Trajectory Classification**: Three trajectory types across mixing ratios, empirically bounding $0.25 < r_{\text{crit}} \leq 0.3$
- **Cross-Architecture Validation**: GPT-2-medium reproduces the three-phase pattern with larger magnitude collapse

## 4. discussion.tex

The discussion covers:
- Explanation of spectral decompression as fine-tuning's variance redistribution
- The complementary nature of SLV and perplexity metrics
- The key prevention-detectability tradeoff: real-data mixing reverses trajectories but prevents detection
- Identification of SLV as a cheap spectral indicator
- The reproducible three-phase trajectory and signal attenuation limits
- Practical guidance: setting r > $r_{\text{crit}}$ prevents collapse without monitoring

## 5. conclusion.tex

The conclusion briefly states:
- SLV as a computationally cheap collapse indicator distinct from model quality measures
- The three-phase collapse trajectory
- Signal attenuation preventing reactive controllers
- Empirical localization of $r_{\text{crit}}$
- Cross-architecture support from GPT-2-medium and preliminary evidence from Pythia-1B

## 6. appendix.tex

Contains detailed supplementary material:
- **Alternative EWS Indicator Details** (Table with full comparison of 8 indicators)
- **Per-Generation Cross-Seed Variance** (detailed tables showing metrics at each generation)
- **Controller Signal Sensitivity to EMA Smoothing** (showing robustness of $r_{\text{crit}}$ to smoothing parameter)
- **Training and Compute Details** (AdamW settings, generation parameters, GPU requirements)
- **Use of AI Assistants** (disclosure of Claude usage for code, writing, and literature summarization)

## 7. limitations.tex

The limitations section addresses:
- **Scale and Scope**: Validation at Pythia-410M and partial validation at 1B; last-layer embeddings only; single domain (OpenWebText)
- **Temporal Horizon**: 10 generations may be shorter than production pipelines; Type II trajectories could revert to collapse at longer horizons
- **Generalization**: Signal attenuation may apply to implicit-loop settings with web-scale data; AI assistant usage disclosed

**Summary**: Files 3 (results.tex) and 4 (discussion.tex) do not exist as separate files. The "results" content is contained in experiments.tex, and the discussion is in conclusion.tex. All other files (introduction, method, experiments, conclusion, appendix, limitations) exist and have been fully read.
