D041 confirms the decision: fix the paper to describe BM25 (Option A from my original report), not rebuild data. The rationale is sound — M2 training is past halfway, DDL May 25, data rebuild + retrain is infeasible.

D043 also addresses another issue I may have flagged or will need to review: pool=50 eval replacement and instance count reconciliation. The current eval pool is 8 (1+7 negatives), which means R@10 is always 1.0 (meaningless) and R@1 discriminability is limited. This is actually an important point I should have caught.
 
Now I'm checking that the code and paper descriptions align — verifying the BM25 filtering logic, the structural disconnection criteria, and the reachability definitions all match across the method documentation and formal framing.

The instance count issue in experiments_v1.md is deferred pending the M1v2 completion, so I'll note that as outstanding rather than resolved.

Before posting my review to the Director, I want to flag the key improvements: the BM25 fix is solid and thorough, the formal definition now points in the right direction, the difficulty gradient narrative has been properly recalibrated, and the new section on BM25 baselines provides valuable context — though I should double-check that the "Difficulty Gradient" subsection accurately reflects the embedding-distance negatives as the hardest category.

Looking at the neg_difficulty_analysis metrics, the margin values confirm the ordering: embedding negatives have the lowest margins (0.017 for Qwen, 0.067 for StarCoder), making them hardest, while dataflow falls in the middle (0.0293 and 0.1192 respectively), with random negatives being easiest. This aligns with the narrative, so the subsection is consistent.

```text
The val_bm25_s42.jsonl and val_embedding_distance_s42.jsonl have the same first record (same query_id, same query_tokens), which tells me they both have the same instances. But I need to check if the neg_candidates are different.

Actually wait - both head-1 outputs are identical. This means val_bm25_s42.jsonl is indeed a copy of val_random_s42.jsonl. And val_embedding_distance_s42.jsonl ALSO has the same first record. Are all val sets identical?


I need to focus on the neg_candidates field specifically to see if there are actual differences between these files, rather than looking at the full records.

StarCoder log: 1778811826 (changed from 1778809930 — was 09:52, now different)
Qwen log: 1778810913 (unchanged from 10:08)

The StarCoder log has been updated! Let me calculate: 1778811826 - 1778809930 = 1896 seconds later = ~31.6 minutes later. That means the log was modified roughly at 09:52 + 31.6min = ~10:24 CST. That's just now! The eval@1500 result has likely been written.

Let me tail the log to see the eval result.

```text
All four val files (random, embedding_distance, dataflow_aware, bm25) for s42 are EXACTLY the same size: 361,367,290 bytes. This means they're all copies of the same file. So ALL strategies use the same val set (which is the random val).

This is important! It means:
1. All val sets are identical across strategies → R@1 comparisons are on the same val negatives → fair comparison
2. The val negatives are random (from the random strategy)
3. This means val_loss and R@1 differences across strategies are purely due to training differences, not eval difficulty


4. The build script likely generates the val split once with random negatives before applying strategy-specific mining to the training set.

5. **BM25 mining specifics**: The implementation uses the standard BM25Okapi algorithm to rank candidates, which is consistent with how other strategies handle negative mining.

6. **Query formulation difference**: BM25 queries the full file content (capped at 4096 chars) while embedding-based strategies use their model's encoding. Interestingly, the dataflow_aware strategy also relies on BM25 scoring from the training data builder, so the BM25 baseline is essentially the same ranking mechanism but without the structural filtering that dataflow_aware applies.

7. **Implementation consistency check**: I need to verify whether both scripts use identical BM25 implementations and parameters, since this affects how fairly I can compare the baseline against dataflow_aware.

重要发现：所有 4 个策略的 val 文件大小完全相同（361,367,290 bytes），说明所有 val 集都是同一份数据。这意味着跨策略 R@1 比较是公平的。

现在核实 BM25 mining 实现与 `build_m1_training_data.py` 中 dataflow_aware 使用的 BM25 是否一致。

StarCoder random_s43 eval@1500 results:

- **val_loss**: 0.5239 — **IMPROVED** from 0.5279 (eval@500 best). This means early stopping patience resets to 0/2!
- **R@1**: 0.4912 — **NEW BEST** (up from 0.4780 at eval@1000). +1.32pp improvement.
- **R@5**: 0.9499 (from 0.9492)
- **R@10**: 1.0


Both checkpoints are saved at eval@1500 since val_loss and R@1 both hit new bests, which resets early stopping and lets training continue. The metrics are showing a consistent upward trend—R@1 has been steadily climbing from 0.4708 to 0.4912, and now both loss and recall are improving together at the same checkpoint.

Comparing to StarCoder s42, s43 is already outperforming it significantly: R@1 of 0.4912 at step 1500 versus s42's best of 0.4604 at step 2500, a gain of over 3 percentage points. This aligns with what I'm seeing in the Qwen results where the reduced epoch count in s43 prevents overfitting and yields better performance. Training will continue to the next evaluation at step 2000.

Looking at the Qwen random strategy results, s44 achieves 0.6009 R@1, which is notably higher than both s42 (0.5527) and s43 (0.5554). StarCoder consistently underperforms Qwen across the board, which matches the pilot findings. I should check whether the embedding_distance evaluation for Qwen s43 at step 500 has finished running.

StarCoder random_s43 eval@1500 结果出来了：

- **val_loss**: 0.5239 — 改善（优于 eval@500 的 0.5279），early stopping patience 重置
- **R@1**: 0.4912 — 新最佳（0.4708 → 0.4780 → 0.4912，单调递增）
- 训练将继续（patience 重置），下次 eval@2000

对比 StarCoder s42（3 epochs 最佳 R@1=0.4604），s43 在 step 1500 已超出 +3.08pp。

检查 Qwen eval@500 是否也完成了。

Qwen embedding_distance_s43 eval@500 is still computing. The log hasn't changed. It started at ~10:08, now it's about 10:26 CST, so ~18 minutes elapsed. Should take ~30 minutes total, so another ~12 minutes.

Let me schedule a wake-up for about 12-15 minutes to catch the Qwen eval@500 result. I'll also want to check if StarCoder has progressed further and see the M1 reextract v2 progress.

Actually, 270 seconds (4.5 min) is still within cache. But Qwen eval won't be done in 4.5 minutes. Let me think...


StarCoder's training has resumed and is now working toward step 2000, so the next eval won't happen for a while. I could do a couple of short 270-second sleeps to check progress around 10:31 and 10:35, or I could wait longer to catch the Qwen result when it's actually done, though that might be too long.

A worker has completed: worker_fix_d041-paper-framing-dataflow_20260515T021011. This is about fixing the paper_framing.md dataflow issue - likely the formal definition direction error I reported earlier (where the definition said "reachable" but should say "NOT reachable"). Let me verify the fix by reading the updated paper_framing.md.

But first, let me also check the training logs for eval results since some time has passed.

StarCoder eval@1500 result is in:
- val_loss: 0.5239 (improved from 0.5279 at eval@500 — new best!)
- R@1: 0.4912 (improved from 0.4780 at eval@1000 — new best!)
- R@5: 0.9499
- R@10: 1.0

This is significant:
1. val_loss improved (0.5239 < 0.5279), so early stopping patience resets to 0. Training will continue.
2. R@1 jumped to 0.4912 from 0.4780 (+1.32pp), confirming continued improvement in Epoch 2.


3. Both best_by_val_loss and best_by_recall_at_1 checkpoints were updated, so s43 will keep training through the next eval at step 2000.

Comparing to s42's full 3-epoch run, s43 is already outperforming it significantly — the current best R@1 of 0.4912 is +3.08pp above s42's best of 0.4604, and we're only at epoch 2.

The Qwen eval at step 500 is still running, and I should check the updated paper_framing.md to see if the worker's fix was applied correctly.

The interaction pattern — Qwen (saturated, pos_sim > 0.98) shows smaller gap than StarCoder (healthy, pos_sim ~ 0.80) — suggests representation geometry mediates strategy effectiveness. neg_difficulty margin analysis (+17% Qwen, +28% StarCoder) provides mechanistic evidence for this interaction. Pending: multi-seed confirmation + plan_005 stratified analysis + plan_015 dynamic mining control. This is reported as an observation with mechanistic hypothesis, not an established finding.\\n\\n3. **Scope-bounded inter-procedural data-flow analysis via CodeQL provides a practical pipeline for computing structural connectivity at scale.** 0% timeout, 78% connected-not-gold rate (Z%), 123/131 repos with output at full scale. [Dream [M][W] flag: this is supporting methodology, not a primary research contribution. Drop speculative generalization claims (molecular networks, etc.) — no evidence. Frame as practical tool that enables the study, not a standalone contribution.]\\n\\n## Story Spine\\n\\n- **Problem**: Repo-level code repair requires selecting relevant files from large codebases.

Now I can see the BM25 implementation in `build_m1_training_data.py`:

```python
def compute_bm25_scores(query_content: str, all_files: list[str], file_contents: dict[str, str]):
    from rank_bm25 import BM25Okapi
    docs = [file_contents.get(f, "") for f in all_files]


```

Building the BM25 scorer...

```
m25 = None
            return
        docs = [self.source_files[f] for f in self.all_files]
        tokenized = [d.split() for d in docs]
        self.bm25 = BM25Okapi(tokenized)
```

Both implementations use the same BM25 library, tokenization approach, character limit, and file collection logic. The implementations are consistent.

The main difference is that one script builds the BM25 index per instance while the other builds it once per repository and reuses it. Since both index the same set of Python files from the repo, the IDF weights should be identical, making the scores equivalent for the same query-document pairs.

Now I need to check the worker notification about fixing paper_framing.md. I recall finding a formal definition error where it incorrectly stated "reachable" when it should have said "NOT reachable". Let me verify if that correction was actually applied to the file.

The interaction pattern — Qwen (saturated, pos_sim > 0.98) shows smaller gap than StarCoder (healthy, pos_sim ~ 0.80) — suggests representation geometry mediates strategy effectiveness. neg_difficulty margin analysis (+17% Qwen, +28% StarCoder) provides mechanistic evidence for this interaction. Pending: multi-seed confirmation + plan_005 stratified analysis + plan_015 dynamic mining control. This is reported as an observation with mechanistic hypothesis, not an established finding.\\n\\n3. **Scope-bounded inter-procedural data-flow analysis via CodeQL provides a practical pipeline for computing structural connectivity at scale.** 0% timeout, 78% connected-not-gold rate (Z%), 123/131 repos with output at full scale. [Dream [M][W] flag: this is supporting methodology, not a primary research contribution. Drop speculative generalization claims (molecular networks, etc.) — no evidence. Frame as practical tool that enables the study, not a standalone contribution.]\\n\\n## Story Spine\\n\\n- **Problem**: Repo-level code repair requires selecting relevant files from large codebases. Current retrievers rely on text similarity alone, but lexical similarity ≠ structural relevance. Hard negative mining is the standard approach to improve contrastive retrievers, yet the field lacks systematic understanding of what negative selection strategies work for code and why.\\n\\n- **Existing approaches & gaps**:\\n  - Text-based retrieval (SweRank, SWE-Fixer): blind to structural dependencies\\n  - Graph-guided at inference (LocAgent, RANGER, CodexGraph): structural graphs at inference only, no training signal\\n  - ARISE: data-flow but intra-procedural only (no call boundary crossing), runtime tool calls only\\n  - CoCoHaNeRe (ACM TOSEM 2025): argues gradient-based hard negative methods outperform non-differentiable embedding negatives — but does not test simple static embedding-distance mining in structural code retrieval settings\\n  - Gap: no systematic study comparing negative mining strategies with proper controls, and no mechanistic explanation for when/why each strategy works\\n\\n- **Our contribution**: A systematic analysis of hard negative mining strategies for contrastive code retrieval. We (1) show that simple static embedding-distance mining suffices, challenging the assumption that expensive gradient-based methods are necessary (CoCoHaNeRe's premise), (2) [exploratory] observe that structure-grounded (dataflow) negatives interact with encoder representation geometry and provide mechanistic analysis of when/why different strategies yield different outcomes, and (3) validate findings on downstream SWE-bench task evaluation.\\n\\n- **Headline result template**: \\\"Simple static embedding-distance mining consistently improves code retrieval (+1.6–2.0pp R@1, 2 encoders), challenging the need for expensive gradient-based hard negative methods. Structure-grounded (dataflow) negatives show encoder-dependent interaction patterns — representation geometry analysis via negative difficulty provides a candidate mechanistic explanation for when different mining strategies are effective.\\\"\\n\\n## Core Insight\\n\\nOur pilot data suggests that the effectiveness of hard negative mining strategies may depend on the encoder's representation geometry — a hypothesis derived from two encoders and requiring broader validation. The three strategies explore different dimensions of difficulty: (1) random — no signal baseline; (2) embedding-distance — semantic similarity via pretrained encoder cosine similarity; (3) dataflow-aware — structural filtering (CodeQL-connected files) + lexical similarity (BM25 top-K ranking). When the pretrained space is saturated (high pos_sim → low margin between positive and negative), the encoder needs harder negatives from an orthogonal signal dimension (structure + lexical). When the space has healthy separation, embedding-distance mining alone captures sufficient difficulty gradient. This encoder-strategy interaction, if confirmed, could help explain contradictory findings in prior work.\\n\\n## Dual-Pillar Motivation\\n\\n1. **Primary — Systematic analysis challenging gradient-based assumptions**: Prior work (CoCoHaNeRe, ACM TOSEM 2025) assumes expensive gradient-based hard negative methods are necessary for effective code search. Our controlled comparison shows simple static embedding-distance mining suffices in structural code retrieval, isolating the effect of each strategy.\\n2. **Secondary — Mechanistic explanation via representation geometry**: neg_difficulty analysis (margin distribution × strategy × encoder) provides explanatory depth beyond empirical comparison, offering a candidate heuristic (pos_sim threshold) that, if validated on more encoders, could help practitioners select strategies without exhaustive experiments.\\n\\n## Formal Definition\\n\\nGiven retrieval domain D, structural graph G, query q:\\n**structure-grounded hard negative** = argmax_{x ∈ D : ¬reachable_G(x,q) ∧ x ∉ gold(q)} BM25(q, x)\\n\\nThe structural graph is externally fixed and does not update with the encoder (drift-immune). Negatives are selected from structurally unreachable files (i.e., x ∉ R_G(q), not connected via CodeQL data-flow to the query), ranked by BM25 (lexical similarity).\\n\\n## Title Options\\n\\n- Primary: \\\"What Makes Hard Negatives Work for Code Retrieval? A Systematic Study of Mining Strategies and Representation Geometry\\\"\\n- Alternative: \\\"Beyond Gradient-Based Mining: Static Embedding Negatives Suffice for Contrastive Code Retrieval\\\" [contingent: activate only if M2 dataflow conditional benefit confirmed across encoders]\\n- Backup: \\\"Simple Embedding Mining Suffices: Challenging Gradient-Based Assumptions in Hard Negative Mining for Code\\\"\\n\\n## Venue Fit\\n\\n1. **EMNLP Main fit**: Empirical analysis + mechanistic insight papers are a strong EMNLP archetype (cf. \\\"Do Language Models...\\\" papers). Contribution is understanding, not just a new method.\\n2. **NLP audience**: Frame as contrastive learning methodology with code as instantiation.

The interaction pattern — Qwen (saturated, pos_sim > 0.98) shows smaller gap than StarCoder (healthy, pos_sim ~ 0.80) — suggests representation geometry mediates strategy effectiveness. neg_difficulty margin analysis (+17% Qwen, +28% StarCoder) provides mechanistic evidence for this interaction. Pending: multi-seed confirmation + plan_005 stratified analysis + plan_015 dynamic mining control. This is reported as an observation with mechanistic hypothesis, not an established finding.\\\\n\\\\n3. **Scope-bounded inter-procedural data-flow analysis via CodeQL provides a practical pipeline for computing structural connectivity at scale.** 0% timeout, 78% connected-not-gold rate (Z%), 123/131 repos with output at full scale. [Dream [M][W] flag: this is supporting methodology, not a primary research contribution. Drop speculative generalization claims (molecular networks, etc.) — no evidence. Frame as practical tool that enables the study, not a standalone contribution.]\\\\n\\\\n## Story Spine\\\\n\\\\n- **Problem**: Repo-level code repair requires selecting relevant files from large codebases. Current retrievers rely on text similarity alone, but lexical similarity ≠ structural relevance. Hard negative mining is the standard approach to improve contrastive retrievers, yet the field lacks systematic understanding of what negative selection strategies work for code and why.\\\\n\\\\n- **Existing approaches & gaps**:\\\\n  - Text-based retrieval (SweRank, SWE-Fixer): blind to structural dependencies\\\\n  - Graph-guided at inference (LocAgent, RANGER, CodexGraph): structural graphs at inference only, no training signal\\\\n  - ARISE: data-flow but intra-procedural only (no call boundary crossing), runtime tool calls only\\\\n  - CoCoHaNeRe (ACM TOSEM 2025): argues gradient-based hard negative methods outperform non-differentiable embedding negatives — but does not test simple static embedding-distance mining in structural code retrieval settings\\\\n  - Gap: no systematic study comparing negative mining strategies with proper controls, and no mechanistic explanation for when/why each strategy works\\\\n\\\\n- **Our contribution**: A systematic analysis of hard negative mining strategies for contrastive code retrieval. We (1) show that simple static embedding-distance mining suffices, challenging the assumption that expensive gradient-based methods are necessary (CoCoHaNeRe's premise), (2) [exploratory] observe that structure-grounded (dataflow) negatives interact with encoder representation geometry and provide mechanistic analysis of when/why different strategies yield different outcomes, and (3) validate findings on downstream SWE-bench task evaluation.\\\\n\\\\n- **Headline result template**: \\\\\\\"Simple static embedding-distance mining consistently improves code retrieval (+1.6–2.0pp R@1, 2 encoders), challenging the need for expensive gradient-based hard negative methods. Structure-grounded (dataflow) negatives show encoder-dependent interaction patterns — representation geometry analysis via negative difficulty provides a candidate mechanistic explanation for when different mining strategies are effective.\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n## Core Insight\\\\n\\\\nOur pilot data suggests that the effectiveness of hard negative mining strategies may depend on the encoder's representation geometry — a hypothesis derived from two encoders and requiring broader validation. The three strategies explore different dimensions of difficulty: (1) random — no signal baseline; (2) embedding-distance — semantic similarity via pretrained encoder cosine similarity; (3) dataflow-aware — structural filtering (CodeQL-connected files) + lexical similarity (BM25 top-K ranking). When the pretrained space is saturated (high pos_sim → low margin between positive and negative), the encoder needs harder negatives from an orthogonal signal dimension (structure + lexical). When the space has healthy separation, embedding-distance mining alone captures sufficient difficulty gradient. This encoder-strategy interaction, if confirmed, could help explain contradictory findings in prior work.\\\\n\\\\n## Dual-Pillar Motivation\\\\n\\\\n1. **Primary — Systematic analysis challenging gradient-based assumptions**: Prior work (CoCoHaNeRe, ACM TOSEM 2025) assumes expensive gradient-based hard negative methods are necessary for effective code search. Our controlled comparison shows simple static embedding-distance mining suffices in structural code retrieval, isolating the effect of each strategy.\\\\n2. **Secondary — Mechanistic explanation via representation geometry**: neg_difficulty analysis (margin distribution × strategy × encoder) provides explanatory depth beyond empirical comparison, offering a candidate heuristic (pos_sim threshold) that, if validated on more encoders, could help practitioners select strategies without exhaustive experiments.\\\\n\\\\n## Formal Definition\\\\n\\\\nGiven retrieval domain D, structural graph G, query q:\\\\n**structure-grounded hard negative** = argmax_{x ∈ D : ¬reachable_G(x,q) ∧ x ∉ gold(q)} BM25(q, x)\\\\n\\\\nThe structural graph is externally fixed and does not update with the encoder (drift-immune). Negatives are selected from structurally unreachable files (i.e., x ∉ R_G(q), not connected via CodeQL data-flow to the query), ranked by BM25 (lexical similarity).\\\\n\\\\n## Title Options\\\\n\\\\n- Primary: \\\\\\\"What Makes Hard Negatives Work for Code Retrieval?

Discuss relationship. | plan_017 |\\n| Single benchmark | Add RepoBench-R cross-file retrieval | plan_004 |\\n| Statistical significance | Bootstrap 95% CI for all comparisons; full M2 = 9 seeds × 3 strategies × 2 encoders | plan_016, m2_full |\\n| \\\"Complementary signal\\\" overstatement | Temper: \\\"conditionally beneficial\\\" not \\\"always complementary\\\" | Writing discipline |\\n| Missing related work | RepoFusion, GRACE, GraphCodeBERT, ANCE, curriculum HN mining | Writing task |\\n\\n## Evidence Status\\n\\n### Confirmed findings (basis for claims):\\n- D017: True embedding mining helps (+2.0pp Qwen, +1.6pp StarCoder) — challenges gradient-based necessity assumption\\n- D021/neg_difficulty: Qwen pos_sim=0.9855 (saturated), StarCoder pos_sim=0.7985 (healthy); margin differential explains strategy interaction\\n- m2_embed_verify (pilot): 3-strategy comparison confirms ranking (embedding > random, dataflow conditional)\\n- plan_013 (StarCoder pilot): Confirms cross-encoder pattern — embedding helps both, dataflow helps Qwen only\\n- plan_006: CodeQL scalability confirmed at 123-repo scale\\n\\n### In progress:\\n- m2_full_qwen: random s42 DONE (R@1=0.5527), s43 DONE (R@1=0.5554), s44 RUNNING (eval@500 R@1=0.6009). 2/10 runs complete, ~50h remaining.\\n- m2_full_starcoder: random s42 DONE (R@1=0.4604, from parent), s43 RUNNING (eval@500 R@1=0.4708). 1/9+ runs complete, ~65-70h remaining.\\n- m1_reextract_v2: 80.8% complete (22,842/28,276), 0 ERROR, ETA ~15:00 CST May 15\\n\\n### Planned (priority order):\\n- plan_018: BM25 negative baseline (Dream #1 consensus gap — grounds comparison against CoCoHaNeRe's premise)\\n- plan_003: SWE-bench Lite eval (biggest lever for paper strength)\\n- plan_019: Pool size sensitivity (Dream consensus — external validity)\\n- plan_014: Temperature ablation (Dream reviewer concern)\\n- plan_004: RepoBench-R second benchmark (with multi-seed CIs)\\n- plan_015: Dynamic mining baseline\\n- plan_005: Stratified analysis (extended: structural-available vs fallback stratum)\\n- plan_007/008/009: Additional ablations\\n\\n## Contingency (if full M2 results weaken claims)\\n\\n### All 18 runs confirm pilot pattern: Best case\\n- Full statistical power, paper as framed above\\n- Target: EMNLP Main\\n\\n### Dataflow benefit disappears even for Qwen at full scale: Pivot to 2-claim paper\\n- Drop Claim 2 to analysis observation\\n- Paper becomes: \\\"Simple embedding mining suffices (challenging gradient-based assumption) + CodeQL extraction is practical + representation geometry analysis explains prior contradictions\\\"\\n- Still publishable: challenging gradient-based assumption + mechanistic analysis is sufficient for EMNLP Main\\n\\n### BM25 negatives ≈ random (not harmful): Narrative pivot needed [D030 contingency]\\n- If plan_018 shows BM25 negatives perform ≈ random (not << random), the \\\"challenging gradient-based assumption\\\" narrative needs adjustment\\n- Pivot: \\\"systematic comparison reveals embedding-distance mining is the only strategy that consistently helps; gradient-based methods may not be necessary even when BM25 provides no signal\\\"\\n- Paper remains valid as systematic analysis — the core finding (simple embedding mining suffices) stands regardless of BM25 outcome\\n- Claim 1 core preserved: \\\"Simple static embedding-distance mining consistently improves code retrieval without gradient-based mechanisms\\\"\\n- Impact: BM25 result determines narrative nuance, not core contribution\\n\\n### Embedding mining also loses advantage at full scale: Major reassessment needed\\n- Recheck data pipeline for bugs (full-scale data may have distribution differences)\\n- If confirmed: negative result paper — \\\"Why Hard Negative Mining Doesn't Scale for Code Retrieval\\\"\\n- Discuss with user before committing direction\\n\\n## Deprecated Claims (with reason)\\n\\n- ~~\\\"Embedding-distance hard negatives actively harm code retrieval\\\"~~ — FALSIFIED by D017.

Let me review the changes made by the worker:

1. **Formal Definition**: 
   - Now reads: `argmax_{x ∈ D : ¬reachable_G(x,q) ∧ x ∉ gold(q)} BM25(q, x)`
   - The `¬reachable_G(x,q)` is correct — negatives are selected from structurally **unreachable** files.
   - The clarifying text also says: "Negatives are selected from structurally unreachable files (i.e., x ∉ R_G(q), not connected via CodeQL data-flow to the query), ranked by BM25 (lexical similarity)."
   - This fixes the direction error I reported. ✅

2. **BM25 description**: The formal definition now correctly states BM25 as the ranking function, consistent with the code. ✅

3. **Changelog comments**: The worker added tracing comments that reference decision D041 and date the fixes to 2026-05-15, documenting both the dataflow-aware BM25 fix and the reachability negation correction.

4. **Core Insight section**: The three-strategy description now consistently presents dataflow-aware as structural filtering via CodeQL-connected files combined with BM25 lexical ranking. ✅

Now I need to verify whether method_v1.md was also updated, since the paper's method section had the wrong formula in §3.4. The worker was specifically tasked with fixing paper_framing.md, but I should check if the formal definition fix (¬reachable_G) extends to that other file or if it still contains the incomplete formula. I'm checking method_v1.md to see if the embedding similarity issue was actually resolved or if it's still pending, since the worker that ran only targeted paper_framing.md.

paper_framing.md 修复核实：

1. **Formal Definition** — `¬reachable_G(x,q)` 已修正为正确的"不可达"方向 ✅
2. **BM25 ranking** — 明确标注 `BM25(q, x)` 作为排序函数 ✅
3. **解释文本** — "structurally unreachable files (i.e., x ∉ R_G(q))" 与代码一致 ✅
4. **变更追踪** — D041 changelog 注释已添加 ✅

但之前报的 **critical** 问题是 method_v1.md 中的公式（`sim(E_θ0(q), E_θ0(f))` 写的是 embedding similarity，实际代码用 BM25）。需要确认这个也被修了。

```text
0	# §3 Method
1	
2	## §3.1 Problem Formulation
3	
4	We address the task of **repo-level code retrieval for bug fixing**: given a natural-language bug report or issue description $q$, retrieve the top-$k$ most relevant source files from a repository's file set $\mathcal{F} = \{f_1, f_2, \ldots, f_N\}$. The gold set $\mathcal{F}^+_q \subset \mathcal{F}$ denotes the files modified in the ground-truth patch.
5	
6	We formulate this as a contrastive learning problem. Let $E_\theta$ be a pretrained encoder parameterized by $\theta$. We learn an embedding space where the similarity between a query $q$ and its gold files exceeds the similarity to non-gold files:
7	
8	$$\text{sim}(E_\theta(q), E_\theta(f^+)) \gg \text{sim}(E_\theta(q), E_\theta(f^-))$$
9	
10	where $\text{sim}(\cdot, \cdot)$ denotes cosine similarity.
11	
12	The quality of the learned embedding space depends critically on the selection of negative files $f^-$ during training. We systematically compare three negative mining strategies—random, embedding-distance, and dataflow-aware—and analyze how their effectiveness interacts with the encoder's pretrained representation geometry.
13	
14	## §3.2 Structural Information Extraction
15	
16	### CodeQL Bounded Data-Flow Analysis
17	
18	We use CodeQL \cite{codeql2019} to perform scope-bounded inter-procedural data-flow analysis on each repository. We define taint-tracking queries with a bounded analysis depth (2-hop) that trace data flow from designated sources to sinks across function call boundaries. This produces two complementary structural views:
19	
20	- **Call graph**: function-level call relationships within and across files, capturing which functions invoke which others.
21	- **Data-flow graph**: inter-procedural data-flow paths $\mathcal{P} = \{(v_{\text{src}}, v_1, \ldots, v_{\text{sink}})\}$, where each node $v_i$ is annotated with its enclosing file. These paths trace how data propagates through function parameters, return values, and shared state across call boundaries.
22	
23	### File-Level Reachability
24	
25	From the extracted data-flow paths, we construct a file-level structural connectivity graph $G = (V, E)$, where $V = \mathcal{F}$ and an edge $(f_i, f_j) \in E$ exists if and only if at least one data-flow path in $\mathcal{P}$ traverses both $f_i$ and $f_j$. Two files are **connected** if data flows between them across call boundaries; otherwise they are **disconnected**.
26	
27	A key design property is that $G$ is **externally fixed**: it is computed once from the repository's static structure and does not update during encoder training. This makes the structural signal immune to representation drift \cite{xiong2021ance}, a known issue in dynamic negative mining where the mining distribution shifts as the encoder updates.
28	
29	At full scale, 78% of files connected in $G$ are non-gold files (structurally related but not in the patch), providing a rich pool for structure-grounded negative mining [Source: paper_framing, plan_006].
30	
31	### Beniget Fallback
32	
33	For repositories where CodeQL database creation fails (e.g., unsupported build configurations or missing dependencies), we employ beniget—a lightweight Python def-use chain analyzer—as a fallback. Beniget operates directly on the AST without requiring a compiled CodeQL database, providing partial structural information at lower computational cost. Across the full dataset, CodeQL succeeded on 15,133 instances and beniget contributed an additional 764 instances via fallback [Source: m1_extraction registry].
34	
35	### Coverage Statistics
36	
37	The extraction pipeline achieves the following at full scale (131 repositories, 44,173 instances attempted) [Source: m1_extraction and plan_006 registries]:
38	
39	| Metric | Value |
40	|--------|-------|
41	| Timeout rate | 0% (all repository tiers) |
42	| Repository coverage | 123/131 (93.9%) |
43	| Structural data rate | 34% of instances |
44	| Connected-not-gold rate (Z%) | 78% overall; median 96% for repositories with 500+ instances |
45	
46	The 0% timeout rate confirms the tractability of bounded inter-procedural analysis at scale. The structural data rate of 34% reflects transient filesystem failures during batch extraction rather than fundamental limitations of the analysis; a re-extraction pass is expected to recover the majority of failed instances (§6). The high Z% in large repositories indicates that structural connectivity provides a rich negative mining signal precisely where lexical ambiguity is greatest.
47	
48	## §3.3 Structure-Aware Negative Mining
49	
50	We compare three negative mining strategies spanning a spectrum from uninformed to structure-grounded selection. All mining is **static**: negatives are computed once before training from the frozen pretrained encoder $E_{\theta_0}$ and the fixed structural graph $G$, and are not refreshed during fine-tuning.
51	
52	### Random Negatives
53	
54	For each query $q$, we sample $K$ negatives uniformly at random from $\mathcal{F} \setminus \mathcal{F}^+_q$:
55	
56	$$f^-_{\text{rand}} \sim \text{Uniform}(\mathcal{F} \setminus \mathcal{F}^+_q), \quad |\{f^-_{\text{rand}}\}| = K$$
57	
58	This baseline provides unbiased but typically easy negatives, as randomly chosen files are unlikely to share topical or structural similarity with the query.
59	
60	### Embedding-Distance Negatives
61	
62	We compute embeddings for all files and queries using $E_{\theta_0}$ (before fine-tuning) and build a FAISS index \cite{johnson2021faiss} over file embeddings. For each query $q$, we select the $K$ non-gold files with highest cosine similarity in the pretrained embedding space:
63	
64	$$f^-_{\text{embed}} = \underset{f \in \mathcal{F} \setminus \mathcal{F}^+_q}{\text{argtop-}K}\ \text{sim}(E_{\theta_0}(q), E_{\theta_0}(f))$$
65	
66	These negatives occupy the region of the embedding space where the pretrained encoder is most uncertain, forcing the fine-tuned model to learn finer distinctions. This approach requires only a single forward pass through $E_{\theta_0}$ and avoids the instability and computational overhead of online re-mining \cite{xiong2021ance}.
67	
68	### Dataflow-Aware Negatives
69	
70	This strategy combines BM25 ranking with structural reachability filtering. For query $q$ with gold files $\mathcal{F}^+_q$, define the reachability set:
71	
72	$$\mathcal{R}_G(q) = \{f \in \mathcal{F} : \exists f^+ \in \mathcal{F}^+_q,\ (f^+, f) \in E^*\}$$
73	
74	where $E^*$ denotes the 2-hop bounded reachability in $G$. The dataflow-aware negatives are:
75	
76	$$f^-_{\text{df}} = \underset{f \in \mathcal{F} \setminus \mathcal{F}^+_q :\ f \notin \mathcal{R}_G(q)}{\text{argtop-}K}\ \text{BM25}(q, f)$$
77	
78	These files are structurally **disconnected** from the gold files in the data-flow graph (no inter-procedural data-flow path reaches them) yet exhibit high BM25 lexical similarity with the query (hard to distinguish on surface). By training the encoder to distinguish these lexically similar but structurally unreachable files from true positives, we aim to push the embedding space toward capturing functional distinctions that surface-level similarity misses.
79	
80	For instances lacking structural connectivity data (~66% of training data), the dataflow-aware strategy falls back to embedding-distance mining, ensuring consistent negative count across all instances. We analyze the fallback stratum separately in stratified evaluation (§5).
81	
82	### Difficulty Gradient
83	
84	The three strategies impose an expected difficulty ordering. Random negatives are easiest (low similarity, no structural constraint). Embedding-distance negatives are hardest (highest pretrained similarity, no structural constraint). Dataflow-aware negatives apply structural filtering via CodeQL reachability and rank candidates by BM25, selecting files that are structurally disconnected yet lexically similar to the query. We quantify this ordering empirically via the *negative difficulty* metric: the mean cosine similarity between each query and its assigned negatives in the pretrained space (§5).
85	
86	### Relationship to BM25 Baselines
87	
88	In addition to the three primary strategies, we evaluate BM25-mined negatives as a supplementary comparison. BM25 negatives are constructed by indexing all repository files with Okapi BM25 \cite{robertson2009bm25} and selecting the top-$K$ highest-scoring non-gold files per query. This provides a lexical-overlap baseline that grounds our comparison against the gradient-based premise of CoCoHaNeRe \cite{fan2025cocohanere}, which argues that non-differentiable embedding negatives are "slow and ineffective" compared to gradient-based methods. At the top-7 level (matching training $K$), BM25 and embedding-distance negatives diverge substantially for medium and large repositories (Jaccard overlap 0.30–0.38), indicating that the two approaches select meaningfully different negatives despite high overlap at the full candidate level [Source: plan_018 registry].
89	
90	## §3.4 Contrastive Fine-tuning
91	
92	### InfoNCE Loss
93	
94	We train with InfoNCE loss \cite{karpukhin2020dpr}. For a query $q$ with positive file $f^+$ and a set of $K$ negatives $\{f^-_1, \ldots, f^-_K\}$:
95	
96	$$\mathcal{L} = -\log \frac{\exp(\text{sim}(E_\theta(q), E_\theta(f^+)) / \tau)}{\exp(\text{sim}(E_\theta(q), E_\theta(f^+)) / \tau) + \sum_{k=1}^{K} \exp(\text{sim}(E_\theta(q), E_\theta(f^-_k)) / \tau)}$$
97	
98	where $\tau$ is a learnable temperature parameter initialized to 0.07 and $K = 7$ negatives per query [Source: m2_full_qwen registry].
99	
100	### LoRA Fine-tuning Setup
101	
102	We fine-tune two decoder-only pretrained code models—Qwen2.5-Coder-3B \cite{hui2024qwen25coder} and StarCoder2-3B \cite{li2023starcoder}—using LoRA \cite{hu2022lora} applied to the query and value projection matrices ($W_q$, $W_v$) of each attention layer, with rank $r = 16$, scaling factor $\alpha = 32$, and dropout 0.05. The base model weights remain frozen; only the LoRA adapters and projection head are updated.
103	
104	Each encoder produces fixed-dimensional representations via mean pooling over non-padding positions of the last hidden layer, followed by L2 normalization. A two-layer MLP projection head (Linear→GELU→Linear) maps the pooled hidden state to a 256-dimensional embedding space [Source: m2_full_qwen registry].
105	
106	Training uses AdamW with learning rate $2 \times 10^{-5}$, weight decay 0.01, cosine annealing with 10% linear warmup, and gradient clipping at max norm 1.0. Input sequences are truncated to 2,048 tokens. Batch size is 8 with gradient checkpointing enabled.
107	
108	### Dual Checkpoint Strategy
109	
110	We observe that validation loss and retrieval metrics (Recall@1) do not always select the same checkpoint, particularly for StarCoder2-3B. We therefore maintain two checkpoints throughout training: $\theta^*_{\text{loss}}$ (minimum validation loss) and $\theta^*_{\text{R@1}}$ (maximum validation Recall@1). Final evaluation uses $\theta^*_{\text{R@1}}$, and we report both to enable analysis of the loss–metric disagreement [Source: D036 decision].
111	
112	### Early Stopping
113	
114	The initial seed ($s_{42}$) trains for 3 epochs to provide a complete overfitting curve; subsequent seeds ($s_{43}$, $s_{44}$) train for 2 epochs with early stopping (patience = 2 evaluation cycles, evaluated every 500 steps) based on validation loss. This design was informed by observed overfitting after epoch 1 in $s_{42}$ runs [Source: D026 decision].

We systematically compare three negative mining strategies—random, embedding-distance, and dataflow-aware—and analyze how their effectiveness interacts with the encoder's pretrained representation geometry.\n\n## §3.2 Structural Information Extraction\n\n### CodeQL Bounded Data-Flow Analysis\n\nWe use CodeQL \\cite{codeql2019} to perform scope-bounded inter-procedural data-flow analysis on each repository. We define taint-tracking queries with a bounded analysis depth (2-hop) that trace data flow from designated sources to sinks across function call boundaries. This produces two complementary structural views:\n\n- **Call graph**: function-level call relationships within and across files, capturing which functions invoke which others.\n- **Data-flow graph**: inter-procedural data-flow paths $\\mathcal{P} = \\{(v_{\\text{src}}, v_1, \\ldots, v_{\\text{sink}})\\}$, where each node $v_i$ is annotated with its enclosing file. These paths trace how data propagates through function parameters, return values, and shared state across call boundaries.\n\n### File-Level Reachability\n\nFrom the extracted data-flow paths, we construct a file-level structural connectivity graph $G = (V, E)$, where $V = \\mathcal{F}$ and an edge $(f_i, f_j) \\in E$ exists if and only if at least one data-flow path in $\\mathcal{P}$ traverses both $f_i$ and $f_j$. Two files are **connected** if data flows between them across call boundaries; otherwise they are **disconnected**.\n\nA key design property is that $G$ is **externally fixed**: it is computed once from the repository's static structure and does not update during encoder training. This makes the structural signal immune to representation drift \\cite{xiong2021ance}, a known issue in dynamic negative mining where the mining distribution shifts as the encoder updates.\n\nAt full scale, 78% of files connected in $G$ are non-gold files (structurally related but not in the patch), providing a rich pool for structure-grounded negative mining [Source: paper_framing, plan_006].\n\n### Beniget Fallback\n\nFor repositories where CodeQL database creation fails (e.g., unsupported build configurations or missing dependencies), we employ beniget—a lightweight Python def-use chain analyzer—as a fallback. Beniget operates directly on the AST without requiring a compiled CodeQL database, providing partial structural information at lower computational cost. Across the full dataset, CodeQL succeeded on 15,133 instances and beniget contributed an additional 764 instances via fallback [Source: m1_extraction registry].\n\n### Coverage Statistics\n\nThe extraction pipeline achieves the following at full scale (131 repositories, 44,173 instances attempted) [Source: m1_extraction and plan_006 registries]:\n\n| Metric | Value |\n|--------|-------|\n| Timeout rate | 0% (all repository tiers) |\n| Repository coverage | 123/131 (93.9%) |\n| Structural data rate | 34% of instances |\n| Connected-not-gold rate (Z%) | 78% overall; median 96% for repositories with 500+ instances |\n\nThe 0% timeout rate confirms the tractability of bounded inter-procedural analysis at scale. The structural data rate of 34% reflects transient filesystem failures during batch extraction rather than fundamental limitations of the analysis; a re-extraction pass is expected to recover the majority of failed instances (§6). The high Z% in large repositories indicates that structural connectivity provides a rich negative mining signal precisely where lexical ambiguity is greatest.\n\n## §3.3 Structure-Aware Negative Mining\n\nWe compare three negative mining strategies spanning a spectrum from uninformed to structure-grounded selection. All mining is **static**: negatives are computed once before training from the frozen pretrained encoder $E_{\\theta_0}$ and the fixed structural graph $G$, and are not refreshed during fine-tuning.\n\n### Random Negatives\n\nFor each query $q$, we sample $K$ negatives uniformly at random from $\\mathcal{F} \\setminus \\mathcal{F}^+_q$:\n\n$$f^-_{\\text{rand}} \\sim \\text{Uniform}(\\mathcal{F} \\setminus \\mathcal{F}^+_q), \\quad |\\{f^-_{\\text{rand}}\\}| = K$$\n\nThis baseline provides unbiased but typically easy negatives, as randomly chosen files are unlikely to share topical or structural similarity with the query.\n\n### Embedding-Distance Negatives\n\nWe compute embeddings for all files and queries using $E_{\\theta_0}$ (before fine-tuning) and build a FAISS index \\cite{johnson2021faiss} over file embeddings. For each query $q$, we select the $K$ non-gold files with highest cosine similarity in the pretrained embedding space:\n\n$$f^-_{\\text{embed}} = \\underset{f \\in \\mathcal{F} \\setminus \\mathcal{F}^+_q}{\\text{argtop-}K}\\ \\text{sim}(E_{\\theta_0}(q), E_{\\theta_0}(f))$$\n\nThese negatives occupy the region of the embedding space where the pretrained encoder is most uncertain, forcing the fine-tuned model to learn finer distinctions. This approach requires only a single forward pass through $E_{\\theta_0}$ and avoids the instability and computational overhead of online re-mining \\cite{xiong2021ance}.\n\n### Dataflow-Aware Negatives\n\nThis strategy combines BM25 ranking with structural reachability filtering. For query $q$ with gold files $\\mathcal{F}^+_q$, define the reachability set:\n\n$$\\mathcal{R}_G(q) = \\{f \\in \\mathcal{F} : \\exists f^+ \\in \\mathcal{F}^+_q,\\ (f^+, f) \\in E^*\\}$$\n\nwhere $E^*$ denotes the 2-hop bounded reachability in $G$. The dataflow-aware negatives are:\n\n$$f^-_{\\text{df}} = \\underset{f \\in \\mathcal{F} \\setminus \\mathcal{F}^+_q :\\ f \\notin \\mathcal{R}_G(q)}{\\text{argtop-}K}\\ \\text{BM25}(q, f)$$\n\nThese files are structurally **disconnected** from the gold files in the data-flow graph (no inter-procedural data-flow path reaches them) yet exhibit high BM25 lexical similarity with the query (hard to distinguish on surface). By training the encoder to distinguish these lexically similar but structurally unreachable files from true positives, we aim to push the embedding space toward capturing functional distinctions that surface-level similarity misses.\n\nFor instances lacking structural connectivity data (~66% of training data), the dataflow-aware strategy falls back to embedding-distance mining, ensuring consistent negative count across all instances. We analyze the fallback stratum separately in stratified evaluation (§5).\n\n### Difficulty Gradient\n\nThe three strategies impose an expected difficulty ordering. Random negatives are easiest (low similarity, no structural constraint). Embedding-distance negatives are hardest (highest pretrained similarity, no structural constraint). Dataflow-aware negatives apply structural filtering via CodeQL reachability and rank candidates by BM25, selecting files that are structurally disconnected yet lexically similar to the query. We quantify this ordering empirically via the *negative difficulty* metric: the mean cosine similarity between each query and its assigned negatives in the pretrained space (§5).\n\n### Relationship to BM25 Baselines\n\nIn addition to the three primary strategies, we evaluate BM25-mined negatives as a supplementary comparison. BM25 negatives are constructed by indexing all repository files with Okapi BM25 \\cite{robertson2009bm25} and selecting the top-$K$ highest-scoring non-gold files per query. This provides a lexical-overlap baseline that grounds our comparison against the gradient-based premise of CoCoHaNeRe \\cite{fan2025cocohanere}, which argues that non-differentiable embedding negatives are \"slow and ineffective\" compared to gradient-based methods. At the top-7 level (matching training $K$), BM25 and embedding-distance negatives diverge substantially for medium and large repositories (Jaccard overlap 0.30–0.38), indicating that the two approaches select meaningfully different negatives despite high overlap at the full candidate level [Source: plan_018 registry].\n\n## §3.4 Contrastive Fine-tuning\n\n### InfoNCE Loss\n\nWe train with InfoNCE loss \\cite{karpukhin2020dpr}. For a query $q$ with positive file $f^+$ and a set of $K$ negatives $\\{f^-_1, \\ldots, f^-_K\\}$:\n\n$$\\mathcal{L} = -\\log \\frac{\\exp(\\text{sim}(E_\\theta(q), E_\\theta(f^+)) / \\tau)}{\\exp(\\text{sim}(E_\\theta(q), E_\\theta(f^+)) / \\tau) + \\sum_{k=1}^{K} \\exp(\\text{sim}(E_\\theta(q), E_\\theta(f^-_k)) / \\tau)}$$\n\nwhere $\\tau$ is a learnable temperature parameter initialized to 0.07 and $K = 7$ negatives per query [Source: m2_full_qwen registry].\n\n### LoRA Fine-tuning Setup\n\nWe fine-tune two decoder-only pretrained code models—Qwen2.5-Coder-3B \\cite{hui2024qwen25coder} and StarCoder2-3B \\cite{li2023starcoder}—using LoRA \\cite{hu2022lora} applied to the query and value projection matrices ($W_q$, $W_v$) of each attention layer, with rank $r = 16$, scaling factor $\\alpha = 32$, and dropout 0.05. The base model weights remain frozen; only the LoRA adapters and projection head are updated.\n\nEach encoder produces fixed-dimensional representations via mean pooling over non-padding positions of the last hidden layer, followed by L2 normalization. A two-layer MLP projection head (Linear→GELU→Linear) maps the pooled hidden state to a 256-dimensional embedding space [Source: m2_full_qwen registry].\n\nTraining uses AdamW with learning rate $2 \\times 10^{-5}$, weight decay 0.01, cosine annealing with 10% linear warmup, and gradient clipping at max norm 1.0. Input sequences are truncated to 2,048 tokens. Batch size is 8 with gradient checkpointing enabled.\n\n### Dual Checkpoint Strategy\n\nWe observe that validation loss and retrieval metrics (Recall@1) do not always select the same checkpoint, particularly for StarCoder2-3B. We therefore maintain two checkpoints throughout training: $\\theta^*_{\\text{loss}}$ (minimum validation loss) and $\\theta^*_{\\text{R@1}}$ (maximum validation Recall@1). Final evaluation uses $\\theta^*_{\\text{R@1}}$, and we report both to enable analysis of the loss–metric disagreement [Source: D036 decision].\n\n### Early Stopping\n\nThe initial seed ($s_{42}$) trains for 3 epochs to provide a complete overfitting curve; subsequent seeds ($s_{43}$, $s_{44}$) train for 2 epochs with early stopping (patience = 2 evaluation cycles, evaluated every 500 steps) based on validation loss. This design was informed by observed overfitting after epoch 1 in $s_{42}$ runs [Source: D026 decision].\n&lt;!-- D041 dataflow-aware BM25 fix: 2026-05-15; 回滚约束方向 2026-05-15 -->\n",

Excellent! Two important results:

## 1. StarCoder random_s43 eval@1500 COMPLETED

The eval@1500 result is in:
- **val_loss = 0.5239** — **IMPROVED** over eval@500's 0.5279 (new best!)
- **R@1 = 0.4912** — **IMPROVED** over eval@1000's 0.4780 (new best!)
- R@5 = 0.9499, R@10 = 1.0
- Both checkpoints saved: best_by_val_loss and best_by_recall_at_1


- The loss-metric divergence from step 1000 has resolved — both val_loss and R@1 are now improving together, with R@1 showing consistent gains of about 2 percentage points per 500 steps. Early stopping patience reset since we hit a new best, so training will continue toward step 2000.

Comparing across models and seeds, StarCoder with seed 43 is now at 0.4912 R@1 versus seed 42's 0.4604 — a 3.1 percentage point improvement from using early stopping with 2 epochs instead of 3. The Qwen baseline across different seeds ranges from 0.5527 to 0.6009, so there's still a gap to close, but the trajectory here looks promising.

Now waiting on the embedding distance evaluation for Qwen seed 43 at step 500 — it's been running for about 22 minutes and should finish within the next 10 minutes.

I'm also reviewing the paper framing fixes, and the key change is correcting the formal definition to use the negation operator properly — it now correctly states that negatives come from structurally unreachable files, which aligns with the actual implementation. me verify these fixes actually resolved the critical issues I identified. The BM25 discrepancy in the dataflow-aware strategy should be corrected in paper_framing.md, but I need to check whether method_v1.md was updated too—that file had the embedding similarity formula that contradicted the BM25 approach. I also want to confirm the formal definition direction was flipped correctly in both places.

**StarCoder eval@1500 出结果了！**
- val_loss = 0.5239 (新最佳，优于 eval@500 的 0.5279 → early stopping 重置)
- R@1 = 0.4912 (新最佳，0.4708 → 0.4780 → 0.4912 持续上升)
- 训练将继续到 step 2000+

Qwen embedding_distance_s43 eval@500 仍在计算中。

现在审查 paper_framing 修复。formal definition 已改为 `¬reachable_G(x,q)`，正确描述了 BM25 ranking。需要核实 method_v1.md 是否也同步修复了。

```text
1	# §3 Method
2	
3	## §3.1 Problem Formulation
4	
5	We address the task of **repo-level code retrieval for bug fixing**: given a natural-language bug report or issue description $q$, retrieve the top-$k$ most relevant source files from a repository's file set $\mathcal{F} = \{f_1, f_2, \ldots, f_N\}$. The gold set $\mathcal{F}^+_q \subset \mathcal{F}$ denotes the files modified in the ground-truth patch.
6	
7	We formulate this as a contrastive learning problem. Let $E_\theta$ be a pretrained encoder parameterized by $\theta$. We learn an embedding space where the similarity between a query $q$ and its gold files exceeds the similarity to non-gold files:
8	
9	$$\text{sim}(E_\theta(q), E_\theta(f^+)) \gg \text{sim}(E_\theta(q), E_\theta(f^-))$$
10	
11	where $\text{sim}(\cdot, \cdot)$ denotes cosine similarity.
12	
13	The quality of the learned embedding space depends critically on the selection of negative files $f^-$ during training. We systematically compare three negative mining strategies—random, embedding-distance, and dataflow-aware—and analyze how their effectiveness interacts with the encoder's pretrained representation geometry.
14	
15	## §3.2 Structural Information Extraction
16	
17	### CodeQL Bounded Data-Flow Analysis
18	
19	We use CodeQL \cite{codeql2019} to perform scope-bounded inter-procedural data-flow analysis on each repository. We define taint-tracking queries with a bounded analysis depth (2-hop) that trace data flow from designated sources to sinks across function call boundaries. This produces two complementary structural views:
20	
21	- **Call graph**: function-level call relationships within and across files, capturing which functions invoke which others.
22	- **Data-flow graph**: inter-procedural data-flow paths $\mathcal{P} = \{(v_{\text{src}}, v_1, \ldots, v_{\text{sink}})\}$, where each node $v_i$ is annotated with its enclosing file. These paths trace how data propagates through function parameters, return values, and shared state across call boundaries.
23	
24	### File-Level Reachability
25	
26	From the extracted data-flow paths, we construct a file-level structural connectivity graph $G = (V, E)$, where $V = \mathcal{F}$ and an edge $(f_i, f_j) \in E$ exists if and only if at least one data-flow path in $\mathcal{P}$ traverses both $f_i$ and $f_j$. Two files are **connected** if data flows between them across call boundaries; otherwise they are **disconnected**.
27	
28	A key design property is that $G$ is **externally fixed**: it is computed once from the repository's static structure and does not update during encoder training. This makes the structural signal immune to representation drift \cite{xiong2021ance}, a known issue in dynamic negative mining where the mining distribution shifts as the encoder updates.
29	
30	At full scale, 78% of files connected in $G$ are non-gold files (structurally related but not in the patch), providing a rich pool for structure-grounded negative mining [Source: paper_framing, plan_006].
31	
32	### Beniget Fallback
33	
34	For repositories where CodeQL database creation fails (e.g., unsupported build configurations or missing dependencies), we employ beniget—a lightweight Python def-use chain analyzer—as a fallback. Beniget operates directly on the AST without requiring a compiled CodeQL database, providing partial structural information at lower computational cost. Across the full dataset, CodeQL succeeded on 15,133 instances and beniget contributed an additional 764 instances via fallback [Source: m1_extraction registry].
35	
36	### Coverage Statistics
37	
38	The extraction pipeline achieves the following at full scale (131 repositories, 44,173 instances attempted) [Source: m1_extraction and plan_006 registries]:
39	
40	| Metric | Value |
41	|--------|-------|
42	| Timeout rate | 0% (all repository tiers) |
43	| Repository coverage | 123/131 (93.9%) |
44	| Structural data rate | 34% of instances |
45	| Connected-not-gold rate (Z%) | 78% overall; median 96% for repositories with 500+ instances |
46	
47	The 0% timeout rate confirms the tractability of bounded inter-procedural analysis at scale. The structural data rate of 34% reflects transient filesystem failures during batch extraction rather than fundamental limitations of the analysis; a re-extraction pass is expected to recover the majority of failed instances (§6). The high Z% in large repositories indicates that structural connectivity provides a rich negative mining signal precisely where lexical ambiguity is greatest.
48	
49	## §3.3 Structure-Aware Negative Mining
50	
51	We compare three negative mining strategies spanning a spectrum from uninformed to structure-grounded selection. All mining is **static**: negatives are computed once before training from the frozen pretrained encoder $E_{\theta_0}$ and the fixed structural graph $G$, and are not refreshed during fine-tuning.
52	
53	### Random Negatives
54	
55	For each query $q$, we sample $K$ negatives uniformly at random from $\mathcal{F} \setminus \mathcal{F}^+_q$:
56	
57	$$f^-_{\text{rand}} \sim \text{Uniform}(\mathcal{F} \setminus \mathcal{F}^+_q), \quad |\{f^-_{\text{rand}}\}| = K$$
58	
59	This baseline provides unbiased but typically easy negatives, as randomly chosen files are unlikely to share topical or structural similarity with the query.
60	
61	### Embedding-Distance Negatives
62	
63	We compute embeddings for all files and queries using $E_{\theta_0}$ (before fine-tuning) and build a FAISS index \cite{johnson2021faiss} over file embeddings. For each query $q$, we select the $K$ non-gold files with highest cosine similarity in the pretrained embedding space:
64	
65	$$f^-_{\text{embed}} = \underset{f \in \mathcal{F} \setminus \mathcal{F}^+_q}{\text{argtop-}K}\ \text{sim}(E_{\theta_0}(q), E_{\theta_0}(f))$$
66	
67	These negatives occupy the region of the embedding space where the pretrained encoder is most uncertain, forcing the fine-tuned model to learn finer distinctions. This approach requires only a single forward pass through $E_{\theta_0}$ and avoids the instability and computational overhead of online re-mining \cite{xiong2021ance}.
68	
69	### Dataflow-Aware Negatives
70	
71	This strategy combines BM25 ranking with structural reachability filtering. For query $q$ with gold files $\mathcal{F}^+_q$, define the reachability set:
72	
73	$$\mathcal{R}_G(q) = \{f \in \mathcal{F} : \exists f^+ \in \mathcal{F}^+_q,\ (f^+, f) \in E^*\}$$
74	
75	where $E^*$ denotes the 2-hop bounded reachability in $G$. The dataflow-aware negatives are:
76	
77	$$f^-_{\text{df}} = \underset{f \in \mathcal{F} \setminus \mathcal{F}^+_q :\ f \notin \mathcal{R}_G(q)}{\text{argtop-}K}\ \text{BM25}(q, f)$$
78	
79	These files are structurally **disconnected** from the gold files in the data-flow graph (no inter-procedural data-flow path reaches them) yet exhibit high BM25 lexical similarity with the query (hard to distinguish on surface). By training the encoder to distinguish these lexically similar but structurally unreachable files from true positives, we aim to push the embedding space toward capturing functional distinctions that surface-level similarity misses.
80	
81	For instances lacking structural connectivity data (~66% of training data), the dataflow-aware strategy falls back to embedding-distance mining, ensuring consistent negative count across all instances. We analyze the fallback stratum separately in stratified evaluation (§5).
82	
83	### Difficulty Gradient
84	
85	The three strategies impose an expected difficulty ordering. Random negatives are easiest (low similarity, no structural constraint). Embedding-distance negatives are hardest (highest pretrained similarity, no structural constraint). Dataflow-aware negatives apply structural filtering via CodeQL reachability and rank candidates by BM25, selecting files that are structurally disconnected yet lexically similar to the query. We quantify this ordering empirically via the *negative difficulty* metric: the mean cosine similarity between each query and its assigned negatives in the pretrained space (§5).
86	
87	### Relationship to BM25 Baselines
88	
89	In addition to the three primary strategies, we evaluate BM25-mined negatives as a supplementary comparison. BM25 negatives are constructed by indexing all repository files with Okapi BM25 \cite{robertson2009bm25} and selecting the top-$K$ highest-scoring non-gold files per query. This provides a lexical-overlap baseline that grounds our comparison against the gradient-based premise of CoCoHaNeRe \cite{fan2025cocohanere}, which argues that non-differentiable embedding negatives are "slow and ineffective" compared to gradient-based methods. At the top-7 level (matching training $K$), BM25 and embedding-distance negatives diverge substantially for medium and large repositories (Jaccard overlap 0.30–0.38), indicating that the two approaches select meaningfully different negatives despite high overlap at the full candidate level [Source: plan_018 registry].
90	
91	## §3.4 Contrastive Fine-tuning
92	
93	### InfoNCE Loss
94	
95	We train with InfoNCE loss \cite{karpukhin2020dpr}. For a query $q$ with positive file $f^+$ and a set of $K$ negatives $\{f^-_1, \ldots, f^-_K\}$:
96	
97	$$\mathcal{L} = -\log \frac{\exp(\text{sim}(E_\theta(q), E_\theta(f^+)) / \tau)}{\exp(\text{sim}(E_\theta(q), E_\theta(f^+)) / \tau) + \sum_{k=1}^{K} \exp(\text{sim}(E_\theta(q), E_\theta(f^-_k)) / \tau)}$$
98	
99	where $\tau$ is a learnable temperature parameter initialized to 0.07 and $K = 7$ negatives per query [Source: m2_full_qwen registry].
100	
101	### LoRA Fine-tuning Setup
102	
103	We fine-tune two decoder-only pretrained code models—Qwen2.5-Coder-3B \cite{hui2024qwen25coder} and StarCoder2-3B \cite{li2023starcoder}—using LoRA \cite{hu2022lora} applied to the query and value projection matrices ($W_q$, $W_v$) of each attention layer, with rank $r = 16$, scaling factor $\alpha = 32$, and dropout 0.05. The base model weights remain frozen; only the LoRA adapters and projection head are updated.
104	
105	Each encoder produces fixed-dimensional representations via mean pooling over non-padding positions of the last hidden layer, followed by L2 normalization. A two-layer MLP projection head (Linear→GELU→Linear) maps the pooled hidden state to a 256-dimensional embedding space [Source: m2_full_qwen registry].
106	
107	Training uses AdamW with learning rate $2 \times 10^{-5}$, weight decay 0.01, cosine annealing with 10% linear warmup, and gradient clipping at max norm 1.0. Input sequences are truncated to 2,048 tokens. Batch size is 8 with gradient checkpointing enabled.
108	
109	### Dual Checkpoint Strategy
110	
111	We observe that validation loss and retrieval metrics (Recall@1) do not always select the same checkpoint, particularly for StarCoder2-3B. We therefore maintain two checkpoints throughout training: $\theta^*_{\text{loss}}$ (minimum validation loss) and $\theta^*_{\text{R@1}}$ (maximum validation Recall@1). Final evaluation uses $\theta^*_{\text{R@1}}$, and we report both to enable analysis of the loss–metric disagreement [Source: D036 decision].
112	
113	### Early Stopping
114	
115	The initial seed ($s_{42}$) trains for 3 epochs to provide a complete overfitting curve; subsequent seeds ($s_{43}$, $s_{44}$) train for 2 epochs with early stopping (patience = 2 evaluation cycles, evaluated every 500 steps) based on validation loss. This design was informed by observed overfitting after epoch 1 in $s_{42}$ runs [Source: D026 decision].

      "content": "# §3 Method\n\n## §3.1 Problem Formulation\n\nWe address the task of **repo-level code retrieval for bug fixing**: given a natural-language bug report or issue description $q$, retrieve the top-$k$ most relevant source files from a repository's file set $\\mathcal{F} = \\{f_1, f_2, \\ldots, f_N\\}$. The gold set $\\mathcal{F}^+_q \\subset \\mathcal{F}$ denotes the files modified in the ground-truth patch.\n\nWe formulate this as a contrastive learning problem. Let $E_\\theta$ be a pretrained encoder parameterized by $\\theta$. We learn an embedding space where the similarity between a query $q$ and its gold files exceeds the similarity to non-gold files:\n\n$$\\text{sim}(E_\\theta(q), E_\\theta(f^+)) \\gg \\text{sim}(E_\\theta(q), E_\\theta(f^-))$$\n\nwhere $\\text{sim}(\\cdot, \\cdot)$ denotes cosine similarity.\n\nThe quality of the learned embedding space depends critically on the selection of negative files $f^-$ during training. We systematically compare three negative mining strategies—random, embedding-distance, and dataflow-aware—and analyze how their effectiveness interacts with the encoder's pretrained representation geometry.\n\n## §3.2 Structural Information Extraction\n\n### CodeQL Bounded Data-Flow Analysis\n\nWe use CodeQL \\cite{codeql2019} to perform scope-bounded inter-procedural data-flow analysis on each repository. We define taint-tracking queries with a bounded analysis depth (2-hop) that trace data flow from designated sources to sinks across function call boundaries. This produces two complementary structural views:\n\n- **Call graph**: function-level call relationships within and across files, capturing which functions invoke which others.\n- **Data-flow graph**: inter-procedural data-flow paths $\\mathcal{P} = \\{(v_{\\text{src}}, v_1, \\ldots, v_{\\text{sink}})\\}$, where each node $v_i$ is annotated with its enclosing file. These paths trace how data propagates through function parameters, return values, and shared state across call boundaries.\n\n### File-Level Reachability\n\nFrom the extracted data-flow paths, we construct a file-level structural connectivity graph $G = (V, E)$, where $V = \\mathcal{F}$ and an edge $(f_i, f_j) \\in E$ exists if and only if at least one data-flow path in $\\mathcal{P}$ traverses both $f_i$ and $f_j$. Two files are **connected** if data flows between them across call boundaries; otherwise they are **disconnected**.\n\nA key design property is that $G$ is **externally fixed**: it is computed once from the repository's static structure and does not update during encoder training. This makes the structural signal immune to representation drift \\cite{xiong2021ance}, a known issue in dynamic negative mining where the mining distribution shifts as the encoder updates.\n\nAt full scale, 78% of files connected in $G$ are non-gold files (structurally related but not in the patch), providing a rich pool for structure-grounded negative mining [Source: paper_framing, plan_006].\n\n### Beniget Fallback\n\nFor repositories where CodeQL database creation fails (e.g., unsupported build configurations or missing dependencies), we employ beniget—a lightweight Python def-use chain analyzer—as a fallback.

The dataflow-aware negatives are:\n\n$$f^-_{\\text{df}} = \\underset{f \\in \\mathcal{F} \\setminus \\mathcal{F}^+_q :\\ f \\notin \\mathcal{R}_G(q)}{\\text{argtop-}K}\\ \\text{BM25}(q, f)$$\n\nThese files are structurally **disconnected** from the gold files in the data-flow graph (no inter-procedural data-flow path reaches them) yet exhibit high BM25 lexical similarity with the query (hard to distinguish on surface).

````text
Let me check the key section - §3.3 Dataflow-Aware Negatives:

Line 70-78: The formula now reads:
```
$$f^-_{\text{df}} = \underset{f \in \mathcal{F} \setminus \mathcal{F}^+_q :\ f \notin \mathcal{R}_G(q)}{\text{argtop-}K}\ \text{BM25}(q, f)$$
```

This is **correct** — it says:
1. `f ∉ R_G(q)` — file is NOT reachable (structurally disconnected) ✅


2. `BM25(q, f)` — ranked by BM25, not embedding similarity ✅

The text confirms that files are structurally disconnected from the gold files in the data-flow graph yet still show high BM25 lexical similarity with the query, which is exactly what we want for hard negatives. The difficulty gradient section accurately describes how dataflow-aware negatives apply structural filtering via CodeQL reachability and rank by BM25, and there's a new section explaining the relationship to BM25 baselines.

Both paper_framing.md and method_v1.md have now been corrected — the formal definition uses `¬reachable_G(x,q)` with BM25 ranking, and the methodology section properly describes negatives as structurally unreachable files ranked by BM25 similarity. The critical discrepancy between BM25 and embedding-based ranking has been resolved, and the new baseline comparison section provides proper context for the approach.

Now looking at the StarCoder eval@1500 results, I'm seeing solid improvements: validation loss dropped to 0.5239 (best yet) and R@1 reached 0.4912, both beating the previous checkpoints. Comparing this against the random seed 42 baseline from 3 epochs, the current run at step 1500 is already outperforming that seed's best R@1 of 0.4604 achieved much later at step 2500.

The seed variance here is substantial—s43 is running about 3 percentage points ahead of s42 across the trajectory, which matters for understanding statistical significance. Now I need to verify the BM25 mining implementation to make sure the negative sampling logic is working as intended.

Checking the code, both `build_m1_training_data.py` and `mine_bm25_negatives.py` use the same BM25 library and tokenization approach, so the ranking methodology is consistent across the pipeline.

The key distinction I'm seeing is that dataflow_aware filters candidates to structurally disconnected files before applying BM25, whereas the baseline BM25 approach ranks across all non-gold files without that structural constraint.

This comparison cleanly isolates whether structural filtering adds value—if the baseline BM25 performs similarly, the filtering isn't helping; if it underperforms, the filtering is beneficial. My main remaining question is whether both scripts implement BM25 identically, since differences in file truncation or tokenization could skew the results.

I should compile a summary report for the Director covering the verified fixes, the StarCoder eval result, the BM25 code review findings, and the current monitoring status.

method_v1.md 也已修复：

- **§3.3 Dataflow-Aware Negatives 公式**（line 76）：`f ∉ R_G(q)` + `BM25(q, f)` — 正确描述了"不可达文件按 BM25 排序" ✅
- **Difficulty Gradient 段**（line 82-84）：正确说明 "rank candidates by BM25" ✅
- **新增 §3.3 Relationship to BM25 Baselines**（line 86-88）：contextualize plan_018 ✅

之前报的 **critical** BM25 vs embedding 差异已完全修复。现在还需核实 BM25 mining 两处实现一致性，然后汇总报告。

Let me review the method_v1.md changes:

1. **§3.3 Dataflow-Aware Negatives (lines 69-81)**:
   - Formula now correctly says: `f^-_df = argtop-K_{f ∈ F \ F+_q : f ∉ R_G(q)} BM25(q, f)` — uses BM25, and specifies f ∉ R_G(q) (NOT reachable). ✓
   - Text says "combines BM25 ranking with structural reachability filtering" ✓
   - Describes negatives as "structurally disconnected from the gold files in the data-flow graph... yet exhibit high BM25 lexical similarity with the query" ✓

2. **§3.3 Difficulty Gradient (lines 84-85)**:
   - "Dataflow-aware negatives apply structural filtering via CodeQL reachability and rank candidates by BM25" ✓

3. **§3.3 Relationship to BM25 Baselines (lines 87-89)**:
   - New section added to explain BM25 baseline comparison ✓

4. Now checking the original critical finding from the earlier analysis.

The key issue was that the formula was using embedding similarity instead of BM25 scoring, but that's been corrected—the formula now properly applies BM25. The reachability direction is also fixed, correctly using the unreachable constraint. Both problems from my earlier report have been resolved in the updated method_v1.md. Checking paper_framing.md confirms the formal definition now properly specifies the structure-grounded hard negative selection with the correct reachability constraint. I'm noticing the Difficulty Gradient section doesn't clearly specify whether dataflow-aware negatives are harder or easier than embedding-based ones—the text hedges because pilot results were mixed, showing embedding performed better at R@1 but without a clear consensus on the underlying difficulty ordering.

Now I'm reviewing the BM25 mining implementation to verify consistency: the script uses the same BM25 library, tokenization approach, file size limits, and utility functions as the training data builder, and the validation set handling is uniform across all negative sampling strategies.

Looking at the instance counts and selection logic, BM25 correctly samples from all non-positive files without structural exclusions like the dataflow-aware approach uses, which is appropriate for a lexical baseline. The overlap analysis shows meaningful divergence between BM25 and embedding selections in larger repositories—around 70% different negatives at top-7—which validates the paper's comparison between these strategies.

I'm ready to compile a combined review for the Director covering the paper framing verification and these mining findings.

method_v1.md 已修复：dataflow-aware 公式改为 `BM25(q, f)` + `f ∉ R_G(q)`，与代码一致。paper_framing.md formal definition 也修正为 `¬reachable_G(x,q)`。

新增了"Relationship to BM25 Baselines"章节。

两个 critical/warning 发现均已修复。结合 BM25 code review 和 StarCoder eval 结果，向 Director 提交综合审查报告。

```text
Both scripts use `MAX_FILE_CHARS = 4096` and truncate content to 4096 chars. Both use `rank_bm25.BM25Okapi` with whitespace tokenization. The BM25 implementations are consistent.

Key difference between the two:
- `build_m1_training_data.py`: BM25 is used within `build_candidate_pools()` to rank candidates for the dataflow_aware strategy (among structurally disconnected files only)


- `mine_bm25_negatives.py`: BM25 is used to rank ALL non-gold files (no structural filtering)

This is the correct comparison design. Now I'm checking the BM25 scoring function in build_m1_training_data.py to see how it computes the scores.

<details><summary>Logged reasoning block</summary>

````text
The two BM25 implementations are consistent:

**`build_m1_training_data.py`** (line 108-114):
```python
def compute_bm25_scores(query_content: str, all_files: list[str], file_contents: dict[str, str]):
    from rank_bm25 import BM25Okapi
    docs = [file_contents.get(f, "") for f in all_files]


```

I'm defining a function that tokenizes the documents and query, initializes the BM25 model, computes relevance scores, and returns them as a dictionary mapping files to their scores.

**`mine_bm25_negatives.py`** (RepoBM25Index class):
```python
class RepoBM25Index:
    def __init__(self, repo_path: str):
        self.source_files = collect_py_files(repo_path
```

Setting up the class initialization... Both implementations use the same BM25 approach with identical tokenization and truncation, but there's a key architectural difference: one builds a persistent index class that's reused across instances, while the other recomputes scores per instance. The underlying computation is the same since they're working with the same repo files, though I'm noticing a subtle distinction in how the file list gets passed through the pipeline. Both implementations query with the buggy/query file content, so they're consistent. The BM25 baseline is a fair comparison point. Now I'm ready to summarize my findings for the director—the critical BM25 fix is verified, the mining code is correct and consistent across scripts, and I have positive results from the StarCoder evaluation and validation set consistency to report.

两个脚本的 BM25 实现完全一致（`rank_bm25.BM25Okapi`、whitespace tokenization、`MAX_FILE_CHARS=4096`、per-repo index）。

现在汇总审查结果发给 Director。

D041 paper_framing.md / method_v1.md 修复审查\n\n**结论**: [severity: info] 两个 critical/warning 发现均已正确修复。\n\n**逐项核实：**\n\n**(a) BM25 vs embedding 公式不一致 (原 critical)**\n- method_v1.md §3.3 dataflow-aware 公式已改为 `argtop-K BM25(q, f)`，`f ∉ R_G(q)` ✓\n- 描述文字改为 \"combines BM25 ranking with structural reachability filtering\" ✓\n- Difficulty Gradient 段改为 \"rank candidates by BM25\" ✓\n- 新增 §3.3 \"Relationship to BM25 Baselines\" 段落，说明 BM25 baseline 与 embedding-distance 在大 repo 的 Jaccard 差异 ✓\n\n**(b) paper_framing.md formal definition 方向错误 (原 warning)**\n- 改为 `¬reachable_G(x,q)` ✓\n- 补充说明：\"Negatives are selected from structurally unreachable files (i.e., x ∉ R_G(q))\" ✓\n\n**状态：已解决，无需进一步行动。**\n\n---\n\n### 2. BM25 Mining 代码审查 (mine_bm25_negatives.py)\n\n**结论**: [severity: info] 实现正确，与 build_m1_training_data.py 中的 BM25 一致。\n\n**核实点：**\n- 库：rank_bm25.BM25Okapi（两脚本一致）✓\n- Tokenization：whitespace split（一致）✓\n- MAX_FILE_CHARS=4096（一致）✓\n- collect_py_files() 逻辑相同 ✓\n- 训练数据 record counts 与其他策略完全匹配（s42: 11,308 train / 2,980 val）✓\n- 排除集：正确排除 query + positive files ✓\n- Val 集：复制 val_random（与其他策略一致——所有 4 个策略 val 文件大小完全相同 361,367,290 bytes，确认 val 是统一基准）✓\n\n**无 critical/warning 发现。**\n\n---\n\n### 3. StarCoder random_s43 eval@1500 结果\n\n**结论**: [severity: info] 训练正常推进。\n\n| 指标 | eval@500 | eval@1000 | eval@1500 |\n|------|----------|-----------|-----------|\n| val_loss | 0.5279 (best) | 0.5430 (patience 1/2) | **0.5239 (新 best)** |\n| R@1 | 0.4708 | 0.4780 | **0.4912** |\n| R@5 | 0.9469 | 0.9492 | 0.9499 |\n\n关键观察：\n- val_loss 在 step 1500 **改善**（0.5239 < 0.5279）→ early stopping 重置，训练继续\n- R@1 稳步上升 +1pp/500steps，当前 0.4912 vs s42 的 0.4604（+3.1pp seed 变异）\n- 之前 step 1000 的 loss-metric 背离（val_loss 恶化但 R@1 上升）在 step 1500 **自行修复**——两者同步改善\n- 双 checkpoint 均更新\n\n**StarCoder random_s43 还在跑，预计 step 2000-2810 才会结束。**\n\n---\n\n### 4. 待审查\n- Qwen embedding_distance_s43 eval@500：仍在计算（~10:08 CST 开始，约 25min），预计很快出结果。这是第一个 embedding 策略的 full-scale eval，对 Claim 1 关键。",

Another worker completed: worker_fix_d041-neg-difficulty-check_20260515T021009. This is about D041 neg-difficulty check. Let me check what this worker did and verify the results.

But first, let me also check the eval results since more time has passed. The Qwen embedding_distance_s43 eval@500 should be close to finishing now.

Let me also post my findings about the paper_framing/method_v1 fix and the BM25 mining code review to Director.

First, let me check the training logs for eval results.

StarCoder eval@1500 result is confirmed in the log:
- val_loss: 0.5239 (new best, improved from 0.5279)
- R@1: 0.4912 (new best, improved from 0.4780)
- Both checkpoints updated
- Training continues (early stopping reset)

Qwen embedding_distance_s43 eval@500 still computing - log still ends at step 500 with loss=0.3657.

Now let me review the CoCoHaNeRe citation check. Let me check what this worker was about. The paper_framing.md references CoCoHaNeRe (ACM TOSEM 2025) multiple times as the main paper being challenged. 

I should look for any citation updates in the registry or check if literature_map.yaml has been modified.

StarCoder eval@1500 result is now visible in the log:
- eval@1500: val_loss=0.5238752736176607, R@1=0.49115334207077327, R@5=0.9498689384010485, R@10=1.0
- New best val_loss (0.5239 < previous 0.5279) → patience reset
- New best R@1 (0.4912 > previous 0.4780)
- Both checkpoints updated
- Training will continue to step 2000


Qwen embedding_distance_s43 is still running its eval at step 500 — it's been going for over 30 minutes now, so it should wrap up soon. I'm also looking into the neg-difficulty-check worker to understand what it's validating, which appears to be related to the D041 fixes. Let me trace through the decisions.yaml to see the full scope of those changes.

StarCoder eval@1500 确认完成：
- **val_loss=0.5239**（新 best，从 0.5279 改善）→ patience 重置，训练继续
- **R@1=0.4912**（新 best，+1.32pp vs eval@1000 的 0.4780）
- 训练将继续到 step 2000

Qwen embedding_distance_s43 eval@500 仍在计算。现在检查 neg-difficulty-check worker 结果。

810	  summary: Dataflow-aware 策略论文描述改为 BM25 排序（匹配代码实现），不重建数据
811	  rationale: Reviewer critical 发现：代码用 BM25 top-K 排序，论文写 embedding similarity。M2 训练已过半、DDL
812	    May 25，重建数据+重跑不可行。实验结果有效（基于 BM25 数据训练的对比结论成立）。难度梯度叙事调整为三策略探索不同维度的难度（random=无信号,
813	    embedding=语义, dataflow=结构过滤+词法）。需修改 paper_framing.md §3.4 公式、difficulty gradient
814	    论述、method 初稿。

828	  summary: 实现 pool=50 独立评估脚本，重新评估所有 best checkpoints；删除 R@10 报告
829	  rationale: Reviewer critical：当前 eval pool=8（1+7 negatives），R@10 恒为 1.0 无意义，R@1 区分度不足审稿人会质疑。无需重训，只需对已有
830	    best checkpoints 做 pool=50 的独立推理评估。训练本身用 num_negatives=7 是合理的（InfoNCE），但评估指标报告必须基于更大

````text
I now have the full literature_map.yaml. Let me review the CoCoHaNeRe entry:

```yaml
- title: "Effective Hard Negative Mining for Contrastive Learning-Based Code Search"
  authors: "Fan Y., Li C., Ge J., Huang L., Luo B."
  venue: "ACM TOSEM"
  year: 2025
  relation: contrast-target
  summary: "CoCoHaNeRe: 提出可微分 hard negative 机制用于代码搜索对比学习。其对 hard negative 机制的处理与 StructFuse 的发现形成关键对照——StructFuse 证明 true embedding-distance mining 即可持续提升性能。"


```

The key tension here is that CoCoHaNeRe argues non-differentiable embedding negatives are ineffective for learning, but StructFuse demonstrates that true embedding distance mining still works well—this is the core correction StructFuse makes to CoCoHaNeRe's claim.

Now I'm verifying the citation details: the paper title is "Effective Hard Negative Mining for Contrastive Learning-Based Code Search," published in ACM TOSEM 2025 by Fan Y., Li C., Ge J., Huang L., and Luo B. The worker already completed the verification, so I should check whether the attributed claims about non-differentiable negatives being slow and ineffective actually match what the paper argues.
