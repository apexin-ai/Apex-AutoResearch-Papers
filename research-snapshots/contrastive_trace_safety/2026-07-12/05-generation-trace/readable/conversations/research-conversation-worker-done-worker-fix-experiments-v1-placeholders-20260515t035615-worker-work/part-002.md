We (1) show that simple static embedding-distance mining suffices, challenging the assumption that expensive gradient-based methods are necessary (CoCoHaNeRe's premise), (2) [exploratory] observe that structure-grounded (dataflow) negatives interact with encoder representation geometry and provide mechanistic analysis of when/why different strategies yield different outcomes, and (3) validate findings on downstream SWE-bench task evaluation.\\n\\n- **Headline result template**: \\\"Simple static embedding-distance mining consistently improves code retrieval (+1.6–2.0pp R@1, 2 encoders), challenging the need for expensive gradient-based hard negative methods. Structure-grounded (dataflow) negatives show encoder-dependent interaction patterns — representation geometry analysis via negative difficulty provides a candidate mechanistic explanation for when different mining strategies are effective.\\\"\\n\\n## Core Insight\\n\\nOur pilot data suggests that the effectiveness of hard negative mining strategies may depend on the encoder's representation geometry — a hypothesis derived from two encoders and requiring broader validation. The three strategies explore different dimensions of difficulty: (1) random — no signal baseline; (2) embedding-distance — semantic similarity via pretrained encoder cosine similarity; (3) dataflow-aware — structural filtering (CodeQL-connected files) + lexical similarity (BM25 top-K ranking). When the pretrained space is saturated (high pos_sim → low margin between positive and negative), the encoder needs harder negatives from an orthogonal signal dimension (structure + lexical). When the space has healthy separation, embedding-distance mining alone captures sufficient difficulty gradient. This encoder-strategy interaction, if confirmed, could help explain contradictory findings in prior work.\\n\\n## Dual-Pillar Motivation\\n\\n1. **Primary — Systematic analysis challenging gradient-based assumptions**: Prior work (CoCoHaNeRe, ACM TOSEM 2025) assumes expensive gradient-based hard negative methods are necessary for effective code search. Our controlled comparison shows simple static embedding-distance mining suffices in structural code retrieval, isolating the effect of each strategy.\\n2. **Secondary — Mechanistic explanation via representation geometry**: neg_difficulty analysis (margin distribution × strategy × encoder) provides explanatory depth beyond empirical comparison, offering a candidate heuristic (pos_sim threshold) that, if validated on more encoders, could help practitioners select strategies without exhaustive experiments.\\n\\n## Formal Definition\\n\\nGiven retrieval domain D, structural graph G, query q:\\n**structure-grounded hard negative** = argmax_{x ∈ D : ¬reachable_G(x,q) ∧ x ∉ gold(q)} BM25(q, x)\\n\\nThe structural graph is externally fixed and does not update with the encoder (drift-immune). Negatives are selected from structurally unreachable files (i.e., x ∉ R_G(q), not connected via CodeQL data-flow to the query), ranked by BM25 (lexical similarity).\\n\\n## Title Options\\n\\n- Primary: \\\"What Makes Hard Negatives Work for Code Retrieval?

We (1) show that simple static embedding-distance mining suffices, challenging the assumption that expensive gradient-based methods are necessary (CoCoHaNeRe's premise), (2) [exploratory] observe that structure-grounded (dataflow) negatives interact with encoder representation geometry and provide mechanistic analysis of when/why different strategies yield different outcomes, and (3) validate findings on downstream SWE-bench task evaluation.\\n\\n- **Headline result template**: \\\"Simple static embedding-distance mining consistently improves code retrieval (+1.6–2.0pp R@1, 2 encoders), challenging the need for expensive gradient-based hard negative methods. Structure-grounded (dataflow) negatives show encoder-dependent interaction patterns — representation geometry analysis via negative difficulty provides a candidate mechanistic explanation for when different mining strategies are effective.\\\"\\n\\n## Core Insight\\n\\nOur pilot data suggests that the effectiveness of hard negative mining strategies may depend on the encoder's representation geometry — a hypothesis derived from two encoders and requiring broader validation. The three strategies explore different dimensions of difficulty: (1) random — no signal baseline; (2) embedding-distance — semantic similarity via pretrained encoder cosine similarity; (3) dataflow-aware — structural filtering (CodeQL-connected files) + lexical similarity (BM25 top-K ranking). When the pretrained space is saturated (high pos_sim → low margin between positive and negative), the encoder needs harder negatives from an orthogonal signal dimension (structure + lexical). When the space has healthy separation, embedding-distance mining alone captures sufficient difficulty gradient. This encoder-strategy interaction, if confirmed, could help explain contradictory findings in prior work.\\n\\n## Dual-Pillar Motivation\\n\\n1. **Primary — Systematic analysis challenging gradient-based assumptions**: Prior work (CoCoHaNeRe, ACM TOSEM 2025) assumes expensive gradient-based hard negative methods are necessary for effective code search. Our controlled comparison shows simple static embedding-distance mining suffices in structural code retrieval, isolating the effect of each strategy.\\n2. **Secondary — Mechanistic explanation via representation geometry**: neg_difficulty analysis (margin distribution × strategy × encoder) provides explanatory depth beyond empirical comparison, offering a candidate heuristic (pos_sim threshold) that, if validated on more encoders, could help practitioners select strategies without exhaustive experiments.\\n\\n## Formal Definition\\n\\nGiven retrieval domain D, structural graph G, query q:\\n**structure-grounded hard negative** = argmax_{x ∈ D : ¬reachable_G(x,q) ∧ x ∉ gold(q)} BM25(q, x)\\n\\nThe structural graph is externally fixed and does not update with the encoder (drift-immune). Negatives are selected from structurally unreachable files (i.e., x ∉ R_G(q), not connected via CodeQL data-flow to the query), ranked by BM25 (lexical similarity).\\n\\n## Title Options\\n\\n- Primary: \\\"What Makes Hard Negatives Work for Code Retrieval? A Systematic Study of Mining Strategies and Representation Geometry\\\"\\n- Alternative: \\\"Beyond Gradient-Based Mining: Static Embedding Negatives Suffice for Contrastive Code Retrieval\\\" [contingent: activate only if M2 dataflow conditional benefit confirmed across encoders]\\n- Backup: \\\"Simple Embedding Mining Suffices: Challenging Gradient-Based Assumptions in Hard Negative Mining for Code\\\"\\n\\n## Venue Fit\\n\\n1. **EMNLP Main fit**: Empirical analysis + mechanistic insight papers are a strong EMNLP archetype (cf. \\\"Do Language Models...\\\" papers). Contribution is understanding, not just a new method.\\n2. **NLP audience**: Frame as contrastive learning methodology with code as instantiation. Representation geometry analysis generalizes beyond code.\\n3. **Against \\\"incremental\\\" criticism**: Paper challenges a prevalent assumption + provides mechanistic explanation for strategy × encoder interaction + validates on downstream task. Three contributions, not one marginal improvement.\\n\\n## Anticipated Reviewer Concerns\\n\\n| Concern | Response | Evidence |\\n|---------|----------|----------|\\n| Only 2 encoders — can you generalize? | n=2 is minimum for interaction claim; we frame as observation with mechanism, not universal law; two decoder-only encoders with distinct pretraining (Fill vs FIM) and representation geometry (pos_sim 0.99 vs 0.80) provide meaningful variation | plan_013 (done), m2_full runs |\\n| BM25 vs true embedding negatives? | Run BM25 negatives to empirically compare with embedding-distance mining, grounding the comparison against CoCoHaNeRe's gradient-based premise | plan_018 |\\n| Pool size sensitivity? | Evaluate at pool {50, 100, 200, 500} to confirm strategy rankings hold at realistic sizes | plan_019 |\\n| Stratified by structural data availability? | Report per-stratum R@1 for 34% with structural data vs 66% fallback | plan_005 (extended) |\\n| Temperature regime specificity | Ablate τ ∈ {0.05, 0.1, 0.2} | plan_014 |\\n| No downstream task evaluation | SWE-bench Lite end-to-end with LLM agent | plan_003 |\\n| Static vs dynamic mining confound | Clarify mining is static; add dynamic baseline | plan_015 |\\n| CodeQL scalability at larger scale | 0% timeout, 78% Z%, 123 repos; m1_reextract_v2 adds more | plan_006 (done) |\\n| Why not compare inference-time graph methods? | Complementary: they navigate at inference, we mine at training.

```text
The worker `worker_doc_mining-impl-diff` was about documenting the mining implementation difference (D041). Let me check what specifically changed:

From D041: "Dataflow-aware 策略论文描述改为 BM25 排序（匹配代码实现），不重建数据"
- The code uses BM25 top-K ranking for dataflow-aware negative selection
- The paper was originally describing it as using embedding similarity
- The worker was tasked to fix the paper_framing.md to match the actual implementation

Looking at paper_framing.md, I can see:


The formal definition now correctly specifies BM25 ranking for structure-grounded hard negatives, the Core Insight section properly describes the dataflow-aware approach with structural filtering and BM25 top-K ranking, and the comments at the bottom document the D041 fixes with timestamps.

I'm verifying the logic: negatives come from structurally unreachable files (not connected via CodeQL dataflow), then ranked by BM25 to surface the hardest negatives—those lexically similar but structurally disconnected from the query. I need to verify that the worker updated all the relevant files consistently and check whether the new paper_framing.md aligns with the actual code implementation to ensure the formal definition is accurate.

Now I have a clear picture of the implementation discrepancy and the fix:

**Two code files with different implementations:**

1. **`build_m1_training_data.py` (data construction script, line 197)**: 
   - `dataflow_aware`: Uses BM25 ranking on disconnected files
   - `scored_disc = sorted(disconnected, key=lambda f: -bm25_scores.get(f, 0))`
   - This is the script that ACTUALLY BUILDS the training data → **BM25 ranking**

2. **`hard_negative_mining.py` (training-time miner, line 108)**:
   - `DataFlowAwareMiner.mine()`: Uses embedding distance to get top-K similar, then filters to NOT reachable via data-flow
   - `similar = self._emb_miner.mine(...)` → **Embedding distance ranking**
   - But the docstring says "high BM25 or embedding sim"

So there's a mismatch: the data building script ranks disconnected files by BM25, while the training-time miner ranks by embedding distance instead, even though they're supposed to use the same strategy.

For M2 training specifically, the pre-built JSONL from `build_m1_training_data.py` is what gets used, so the actual negatives come from the BM25 ranking step. That means D041's fix is right—the paper should reference BM25 since that's what the data building does. But I need to figure out whether `hard_negative_mining.py`'s embedding-based miner is actually used during training or if it's just dead code in this static mining setup.

Looking at the train.py command, it's using a pre-built JSONL file and the `--hard-negative-strategy` flag appears to just label the run rather than trigger dynamic mining. The negatives are whatever `build_m1_training_data.py` wrote into the JSONL. Since the dataflow_aware runs haven't started yet and the dataflow_aware data was built using BM25 ranking, the fix to paper_framing.md is correct—the formal definition should use `argmax BM25(q, x)` for structurally unreachable files.

There's a potential inconsistency though: `hard_negative_mining.py` still has a `DataFlowAwareMiner` class using embedding distance, which could cause issues if it's used in evaluation or analysis scripts. But since M2 relies on static pre-built data, this isn't affecting current experiments.

I should verify whether the difficulty gradient narrative in paper_framing.md was updated to reflect the three-strategy exploration—random (no signal), embedding (semantic), and dataflow (structural filtering + lexical ranking).

The formal definition correction looks solid: changing from `reachable_G(x,q)` to `¬reachable_G(x,q)` properly ensures negatives come from disconnected files rather than connected ones. Now I need to check if Claim 2 was similarly addressed.

Looking at the paper_framing.md file, the Claim 2 wording has been updated to frame it as an exploratory observation—structure-grounded negatives don't consistently outperform embedding-based mining, which aligns with what the pilot data showed across both encoders. The D041 changes appear to be consistently applied throughout, though I'm noticing a potential inconsistency in how the hard_negative_mining.py file relates to these updates.

The docstring in hard_negative_mining.py mentions both BM25 and embedding similarity, but the actual implementation uses embedding distance for the DataFlowAwareMiner. Since this file isn't actively used for M2 data construction, it's not blocking anything, but the documentation could mislead future readers about what the code actually does.

```text
Now I have a complete picture. Let me summarize the findings:

**Code implementation verification**:

1. **`build_m1_training_data.py`** (the script that ACTUALLY builds M2 training data):
   - `dataflow_aware` strategy: takes files NOT in `full_connected_set`, ranks by BM25 scores, takes top-K
   - `embedding` strategy: uses embedding distance scores
   - BM25 tokenization: `d.split()` — whitespace tokenization (D033 flagged this as a potential confound)
   
2. **`hard_negative_mining.py`** (training-time miner class):
   - `DataFlowAwareMiner` ranks candidates by embedding distance and filters out those reachable via data-flow, but this is only used for dynamic mining during training, not for the static M2 dataset construction
   
3. **Key discrepancy**: The static builder uses BM25 ranking while the dynamic miner uses embedding distance ranking, so the current M2 training data was built with BM25 scores rather than embeddings.

**D041 fix assessment**:
- The formal definition in paper_framing.md specifies BM25 ranking for unreachable files, which matches what's in the static builder ✓
- The difficulty gradient description aligns with the implementation ✓
- The unreachable file filtering is correct ✓

**Potential issue**: If plan_015 adopts the dynamic mining approach, it'll use embedding distance for ranking instead of BM25, creating a mismatch between the static and dynamic negative mining strategies.

But actually, D041 decided against rebuilding the data—the fix was to align the paper description with the existing code. Since BM25 is what's already in the static training data and the paper now correctly documents this, that's the right approach given the timeline constraints. I should post the review now.
```

[WRITE HANDOFF] 请立即写你的 handoff。

**格式硬约束**:
- 整条回复**只能**是 &lt;handoff>...&lt;/handoff> 标签包裹
- 禁止在标签外写任何寒暄 / 说明 / 确认（"好的"/"我开始写"/"写完了"等）

**必须覆盖以下 5 个 section（缺一不可，无内容写 N/A）**:

### 1. 🔴 硬约束 / 红线
  本项目特定的不可违反约束（GPU 设备号、服务器名、账号、路径限制等）。
  写本项目特定的，不要抄 CLAUDE.md 通用 L1 红线。
  下一个"你"第一眼看到的就是这里，写错了会被 Director CRITICAL。

### 2. 🖥️ 基础设施快照
  - 服务器名 + 工作目录 + Python 路径 + conda env
  - 模型路径 / 数据集路径 / wandb config / HF cache
  - 活跃进程：PID + tmux session + cron 任务 ID
  写一次就稳定，下一个"你"不用再 SSH 探查。

### 3. 📊 当前状态
  - 你刚做完什么 / 正在做什么
  - registry 里 RUNNING/PREPARING 的实验列表 + 一句话摘要
  - 等待中的 Worker 回调 / Cron / Director 决策

### 4. 📋 待办（条件触发式）
  格式 "条件 X 满足 → 动作 Y"。例如:
  - "Falcon-H1R 下载完成 → sed 修 MODEL_PATH → dry-run → 提交"
  - "pilot_011 出 GC4 结果 → ≥2pp 转架构 narrative，<2pp 写 null-result"

### 5. 🎯 战略上下文
  - 项目核心结论 / 决策链（D001..）
  - 下一个"你"最容易判断错的事 / 容易踩的坑

**写作原则**：
- 第 1 节必须是项目特定的（不是通用 L1 红线）
- 第 2 节让下一轮 BOOT 后能立即开工，避免重新 SSH 探查
- 简洁 > 完整：每节 5-10 行足够，长 handoff 不等于好 handoff

示例格式:
&lt;handoff>
### 1. 🔴 硬约束 / 红线
- 本项目只能用 cuda:4 / cuda:5（之前两次违规 cuda:0 被 Director CRITICAL）
- submit_training_job 不支持 shell builtin（source/conda activate 全不行）

### 2. 🖥️ 基础设施快照
- 服务器：westd-8x6000，工作目录 /root/autodl-tmp/hybrid_reasoning_phases
- Python：/root/miniconda3/bin/python（绝对路径，不走 conda activate）
- 模型：/root/autodl-tmp/qwen35_4b_direct
- 活跃：pilot_011 (PID 203221, tmux=pilot_011, cuda:4)

### 3. 📊 当前状态
我刚完成 pilot_010 分析，正在等 pilot_011 (Falcon-H1R) CoT 生成完成（6/50）。
registry: pilot_011 RUNNING；其他全 DONE。

### 4. 📋 待办
- pilot_011 cron 回调 → spawn worker 跑 probe + GC4 计算
- GC4 ≥2pp → 转架构 narrative；<2pp → null-result paper outline 已就绪

### 5. 🎯 战略上下文
Falcon-H1R 是最后一个数据点。已知 4B/9B GC4 都 FAIL。
易错：不要把 GC4-par (Falcon parallel) 和 GC4-seq (Qwen sequential) 直接对比。
&lt;/handoff>
