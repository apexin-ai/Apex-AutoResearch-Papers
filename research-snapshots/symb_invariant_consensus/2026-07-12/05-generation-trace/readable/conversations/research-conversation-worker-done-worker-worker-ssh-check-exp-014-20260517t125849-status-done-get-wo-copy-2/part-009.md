1	\section{Related Work}
2	\label{sec:related-work}
3	
4	\paragraph{Self-Consistency and Extensions.}
5	Self-Consistency (SC) selects the most frequent answer from multiple sampled chain-of-thought traces \citep{wang2023sc} and remains a strong baseline for multi-path reasoning. Universal Self-Consistency (USC) extends SC to free-form generation by having the LLM itself select the most consistent response \citep{chen2024usc}. Confidence-weighted variants assign trace-level confidence scores to improve vote quality \citep{taubenfeld2025cisc}, while DiVeRSe combines diverse prompting strategies with step-aware verification \citep{li2023diverse}. Recent work has identified scaling plateaus: increasing the number of sampled traces yields diminishing returns beyond a saturation point \citep{loo2025reevaluating}. These findings motivate the search for aggregation mechanisms that extract richer signal from reasoning traces than simple vote counting. SICA represents one such attempt: it replaces plurality voting with symbolic constraint satisfaction over self-extracted FOL formulas. Our negative results show that the bottleneck lies not in the aggregation mechanism but in the quality of self-extracted constraints, a failure mode that vote-based methods sidestep by not requiring formalization at all.
6	
7	\paragraph{Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning.}
8	A growing line of work combines LLMs with symbolic solvers to improve logical reasoning. Logic-LM translates natural language problems into symbolic formulations and delegates solving to an external prover \citep{pan2023logiclm}. LINC pairs language models with first-order logic provers in a modular architecture \citep{olausson2023linc}. More recent systems push this integration further: DyLoS adaptively selects among multiple solver paradigms \citep{xu2026dylos}, Aristotle decomposes problems through a logic-complete search framework \citep{li2025aristotle}, FoVer trains a dedicated verifier on FOL annotations \citep{wang2025fover}, and LogicAgent applies multi-perspective semiotic grounding \citep{luo2025logicagent}. A critical distinction separates these methods from SICA. All of the above rely on trained verifiers, external provers, or multi-paradigm solver selection, components that introduce knowledge beyond the reasoning model itself. SICA instead asks whether the same model that produced the reasoning traces can also extract useful formal constraints from them. Our oracle experiment confirms that sound FOL constraints do improve aggregation (+8.82\,pp); the failure is specific to same-model self-extraction, not to symbolic reasoning as an approach.
9	
10	\paragraph{Test-Time Compute and Reasoning Models.}
11	Scaling test-time computation has emerged as an alternative to parameter scaling. \citet{snell2025scaling} show that optimally allocated test-time compute can outperform larger models and establish a framework for analyzing the compute-accuracy tradeoff at inference. Reasoning-specialized models such as DeepSeek-R1 \citep{deepseek2025r1} internalize extended chain-of-thought through reinforcement learning and produce longer but more coherent traces. Diversity-aware training methods explicitly optimize for trace diversity during test-time scaling \citep{diverseaware2025}. These developments interact with our findings through the $C_0$ diagnostic. Reasoning models produce highly consistent outputs across samples: QwQ-32B achieves $C_0 = 2.6\%$ on our benchmarks, while DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B ($C_0 = 58.3\%$) behaves as an instruction-scale model rather than a reasoning model, likely because its 7B capacity cannot sustain the deterministic reasoning chains learned through distillation. When nearly all traces converge to the same answer, any aggregation method reduces to the unanimous output. The $C_0$ metric thus provides a zero-cost signal for practitioners to determine whether post-hoc aggregation can offer any benefit for a given model.
12	
13	\paragraph{Verification and Reranking.}
14	Trained verifiers offer an alternative path to improving multi-path reasoning. Outcome-level reward models (ORMs) score complete solutions and select the highest-ranked candidate \citep{cobbe2021gsm8k}. Process reward models (PRMs) assign step-level scores and enable finer-grained selection \citep{lightman2023prm}. Math-Shepherd automates process supervision annotation and removes the need for human labels \citep{wang2024mathshepherd}. V-STaR extends self-improvement by training verifiers on both correct and incorrect model-generated solutions \citep{hosseini2024vstar}. Reasoning-aware variants score individual reasoning paths rather than training separate verifiers: RASC assigns confidence scores based on textual quality indicators and consistency \citep{wan2024rasc}, while ReASC frames adaptive sampling as evidence sufficiency and aggregates response-level confidence \citep{kim2026reasc}. These approaches share SICA's goal of selecting better answers from a candidate pool but differ in that they either train a separate scoring model or use lightweight heuristics grounded in textual features rather than formal logic. SICA's constraint extraction requires no training data and no additional model; it relies entirely on the reasoning model's own ability to formalize its logic. Our results suggest that this self-reliance is precisely the problem. Without an external signal to ground constraint quality, self-extracted constraints encode the same biases present in the original traces and fail to provide corrective information.
15	
16	\paragraph{Constraint Satisfaction in NLP.}
17	Constraint-based formulations have gained traction for evaluating and improving LLM reasoning. SATBench benchmarks LLMs on Boolean satisfiability problems and reveals systematic weaknesses in logical structure handling \citep{satbench2025}. Work on integrating LLMs with constraint propagation solvers explores hybrid architectures where the LLM generates candidate assignments and a CP solver enforces hard constraints \citep{llmmeets_cp2025}. SICA's MAX-SAT formulation sits within this broader trend: it uses Z3 to find the maximum-weight satisfiable subset of self-extracted constraints. The key difference is that SICA's constraints originate from the model's own reasoning traces rather than from problem specifications or external knowledge bases. Our finding that these self-extracted constraints lack discriminative power complements the SATBench results: LLMs struggle both to solve formal constraints directly and to produce useful constraints from their own reasoning.
18	
19	\paragraph{Debate and Multi-Agent Aggregation.}
20	Multi-agent debate refines answers through iterative natural language discussion among LLM instances \citep{liang2023encouraging,du2023improving}. In debate, models exchange arguments in plain text and update their positions based on peer responses. SICA takes a structurally different approach: instead of natural language refinement, it extracts formal constraints and resolves disagreements through satisfiability optimization. Both families attempt to move beyond simple voting, but debate preserves natural language flexibility while SICA commits to formal structure. \citet{huang2024selfcorrect} show that LLMs struggle to self-correct reasoning without external feedback, and \citet{mirzadeh2024gsmsymbolic} demonstrate that LLM mathematical reasoning is fragile under symbolic perturbations. Both findings parallel our capability trap: the same model that produced flawed reasoning cannot reliably formalize the correction. Across all six lines of work reviewed here, the consistent pattern is that improving on majority voting requires information beyond what the reasoning model can extract from its own outputs, whether from trained verifiers, external solvers, human annotations, or cross-model interaction.

Now I have all the information needed to execute the fixes. Let me do them in parallel:

1. **C1**: Fix the three bib entries with proper metadata
2. **C2**: Replace `\cite{deepseek2025r1}` with `\cite{guo2025deepseekr1}` in related_work.tex (line 11), delete the duplicate bib entry


3. **W2**: Add σ(c,a) answer_assertion explanation in method.tex §3.3
4. **W3**: Add alternative self-extraction caveat in limitations_content.tex
5. **W4**: Compress Conclusion P3 to single sentence referencing Discussion
6. **I1**: Add "(validation split)" after FOLIO in experiments.tex
7. **I3**: Fix MATH-500 reference in Appendix

Let me check what the MATH-500 reference issue is in the appendix.

tex file. Looking at the prompt templates section, I see MATH-500 mentioned alongside GSM8K and AIME for mathematical reasoning datasets. But checking the actual benchmarks used in the paper, it looks like MATH-500 might be incorrectly referenced—the paper uses GSM8K and AIME, not MATH-500. I need to verify what the correct dataset name should be or if this reference needs to be removed entirely. I'm seeing that MATH-500 appears in multiple places in the appendix but wasn't actually part of our experiments, which creates an inconsistency. The prompt template itself is generic enough to work with any math dataset, so the real issue is whether to remove MATH-500 from those descriptions entirely or add a note clarifying it wasn't evaluated in the paper.

Removing it seems cleaner—I'll update those references to just mention GSM8K and AIME. Now looking at the reviewer feedback, I need to address several specific items: explaining the answer_assertion mechanism more clearly in the method section since it's currently only mentioned in the appendix, adding a caveat about not testing alternative self-extraction approaches in the limitations, and condensing the third paragraph of the conclusion to reference the discussion instead.

Let me tackle the edits systematically. For the DeepSeek citation, I found it in related_work.tex and need to update the citation key from `deepseek2025r1` to `guo2025deepseekr1`. I'll also need to fix the bibliography entries.

Now I'm updating the metadata for several papers: diveaware2025 needs its author list corrected and the publication changed from journal to ICLR proceedings in 2026, satbench2025 requires a new author list and full title, and llmmeets_cp2025 needs its author information updated as well.

Let me pull the conclusion from the system reminder to find that third paragraph for W4. The text discusses the oracle gap and three potential solutions—using supervised FOL extractors, cross-model extraction to break the self-reference problem, and external provers for independent verification. I should compress this into a single sentence that references the relevant section rather than expanding it.

Now I'm moving through the edits systematically, starting with the Discussion section.

    "originalFile": "\\section{Related Work}\n\\label{sec:related-work}\n\n\\paragraph{Self-Consistency and Extensions.}\nSelf-Consistency (SC) selects the most frequent answer from multiple sampled chain-of-thought traces \\citep{wang2023sc} and remains a strong baseline for multi-path reasoning. Universal Self-Consistency (USC) extends SC to free-form generation by having the LLM itself select the most consistent response \\citep{chen2024usc}. Confidence-weighted variants assign trace-level confidence scores to improve vote quality \\citep{taubenfeld2025cisc}, while DiVeRSe combines diverse prompting strategies with step-aware verification \\citep{li2023diverse}. Recent work has identified scaling plateaus: increasing the number of sampled traces yields diminishing returns beyond a saturation point \\citep{loo2025reevaluating}. These findings motivate the search for aggregation mechanisms that extract richer signal from reasoning traces than simple vote counting. SICA represents one such attempt: it replaces plurality voting with symbolic constraint satisfaction over self-extracted FOL formulas. Our negative results show that the bottleneck lies not in the aggregation mechanism but in the quality of self-extracted constraints, a failure mode that vote-based methods sidestep by not requiring formalization at all.\n\n\\paragraph{Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning.}\nA growing line of work combines LLMs with symbolic solvers to improve logical reasoning. Logic-LM translates natural language problems into symbolic formulations and delegates solving to an external prover \\citep{pan2023logiclm}. LINC pairs language models with first-order logic provers in a modular architecture \\citep{olausson2023linc}. More recent systems push this integration further: DyLoS adaptively selects among multiple solver paradigms \\citep{xu2026dylos}, Aristotle decomposes problems through a logic-complete search framework \\citep{li2025aristotle}, FoVer trains a dedicated verifier on FOL annotations \\citep{wang2025fover}, and LogicAgent applies multi-perspective semiotic grounding \\citep{luo2025logicagent}. A critical distinction separates these methods from SICA. All of the above rely on trained verifiers, external provers, or multi-paradigm solver selection, components that introduce knowledge beyond the reasoning model itself. SICA instead asks whether the same model that produced the reasoning traces can also extract useful formal constraints from them. Our oracle experiment confirms that sound FOL constraints do improve aggregation (+8.82\\,pp); the failure is specific to same-model self-extraction, not to symbolic reasoning as an approach.\n\n\\paragraph{Test-Time Compute and Reasoning Models.}\nScaling test-time computation has emerged as an alternative to parameter scaling. \\citet{snell2025scaling} show that optimally allocated test-time compute can outperform larger models and establish a framework for analyzing the compute-accuracy tradeoff at inference. Reasoning-specialized models such as DeepSeek-R1 \\citep{deepseek2025r1} internalize extended chain-of-thought through reinforcement learning and produce longer but more coherent traces. Diversity-aware training methods explicitly optimize for trace diversity during test-time scaling \\citep{diverseaware2025}. These developments interact with our findings through the $C_0$ diagnostic. Reasoning models produce highly consistent outputs across samples: QwQ-32B achieves $C_0 = 2.6\\%$ on our benchmarks, while DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B ($C_0 = 58.3\\%$) behaves as an instruction-scale model rather than a reasoning model, likely because its 7B capacity cannot sustain the deterministic reasoning chains learned through distillation. When nearly all traces converge to the same answer, any aggregation method reduces to the unanimous output. The $C_0$ metric thus provides a zero-cost signal for practitioners to determine whether post-hoc aggregation can offer any benefit for a given model.\n\n\\paragraph{Verification and Reranking.}\nTrained verifiers offer an alternative path to improving multi-path reasoning. Outcome-level reward models (ORMs) score complete solutions and select the highest-ranked candidate \\citep{cobbe2021gsm8k}. Process reward models (PRMs) assign step-level scores and enable finer-grained selection \\citep{lightman2023prm}. Math-Shepherd automates process supervision annotation and removes the need for human labels \\citep{wang2024mathshepherd}. V-STaR extends self-improvement by training verifiers on both correct and incorrect model-generated solutions \\citep{hosseini2024vstar}. Reasoning-aware variants score individual reasoning paths rather than training separate verifiers: RASC assigns confidence scores based on textual quality indicators and consistency \\citep{wan2024rasc}, while ReASC frames adaptive sampling as evidence sufficiency and aggregates response-level confidence \\citep{kim2026reasc}. These approaches share SICA's goal of selecting better answers from a candidate pool but differ in that they either train a separate scoring model or use lightweight heuristics grounded in textual features rather than formal logic. SICA's constraint extraction requires no training data and no additional model; it relies entirely on the reasoning model's own ability to formalize its logic. Our results suggest that this self-reliance is precisely the problem. Without an external signal to ground constraint quality, self-extracted constraints encode the same biases present in the original traces and fail to provide corrective information.\n\n\\paragraph{Constraint Satisfaction in NLP.}\nConstraint-based formulations have gained traction for evaluating and improving LLM reasoning. SATBench benchmarks LLMs on Boolean satisfiability problems and reveals systematic weaknesses in logical structure handling \\citep{satbench2025}. Work on integrating LLMs with constraint propagation solvers explores hybrid architectures where the LLM generates candidate assignments and a CP solver enforces hard constraints \\citep{llmmeets_cp2025}. SICA's MAX-SAT formulation sits within this broader trend: it uses Z3 to find the maximum-weight satisfiable subset of self-extracted constraints. The key difference is that SICA's constraints originate from the model's own reasoning traces rather than from problem specifications or external knowledge bases. Our finding that these self-extracted constraints lack discriminative power complements the SATBench results: LLMs struggle both to solve formal constraints directly and to produce useful constraints from their own reasoning.\n\n\\paragraph{Debate and Multi-Agent Aggregation.}\nMulti-agent debate refines answers through iterative natural language discussion among LLM instances \\citep{liang2023encouraging,du2023improving}. In debate, models exchange arguments in plain text and update their positions based on peer responses. SICA takes a structurally different approach: instead of natural language refinement, it extracts formal constraints and resolves disagreements through satisfiability optimization. Both families attempt to move beyond simple voting, but debate preserves natural language flexibility while SICA commits to formal structure. \\citet{huang2024selfcorrect} show that LLMs struggle to self-correct reasoning without external feedback, and \\citet{mirzadeh2024gsmsymbolic} demonstrate that LLM mathematical reasoning is fragile under symbolic perturbations. Both findings parallel our capability trap: the same model that produced flawed reasoning cannot reliably formalize the correction. Across all six lines of work reviewed here, the consistent pattern is that improving on majority voting requires information beyond what the reasoning model can extract from its own outputs, whether from trained verifiers, external solvers, human annotations, or cross-model interaction.",

When nearly all traces converge to the same answer, any aggregation method reduces to the unanimous output. The $C_0$ metric thus provides a zero-cost signal for practitioners to determine whether post-hoc aggregation can offer any benefit for a given model.",

          " \\paragraph{Verification and Reranking.}",
          " Trained verifiers offer an alternative path to improving multi-path reasoning. Outcome-level reward models (ORMs) score complete solutions and select the highest-ranked candidate \\citep{cobbe2021gsm8k}. Process reward models (PRMs) assign step-level scores and enable finer-grained selection \\citep{lightman2023prm}. Math-Shepherd automates process supervision annotation and removes the need for human labels \\citep{wang2024mathshepherd}. V-STaR extends self-improvement by training verifiers on both correct and incorrect model-generated solutions \\citep{hosseini2024vstar}. Reasoning-aware variants score individual reasoning paths rather than training separate verifiers: RASC assigns confidence scores based on textual quality indicators and consistency \\citep{wan2024rasc}, while ReASC frames adaptive sampling as evidence sufficiency and aggregates response-level confidence \\citep{kim2026reasc}. These approaches share SICA's goal of selecting better answers from a candidate pool but differ in that they either train a separate scoring model or use lightweight heuristics grounded in textual features rather than formal logic. SICA's constraint extraction requires no training data and no additional model; it relies entirely on the reasoning model's own ability to formalize its logic. Our results suggest that this self-reliance is precisely the problem. Without an external signal to ground constraint quality, self-extracted constraints encode the same biases present in the original traces and fail to provide corrective information."

    "originalFile": "\\section{Method: The SICA Pipeline}\n\\label{sec:method}\n\nThis section describes Symbolic Invariant Consensus Aggregation (SICA), which extracts first-order logic (FOL) constraints from multiple reasoning traces produced by a single LLM, formulates a weighted partial MAX-SAT problem, and selects the answer best supported by the satisfiable subset.\n\n\\subsection{Overview}\n\\label{sec:method-overview}\n\nGiven a question $q$, SICA proceeds in four stages. First, an LLM generates $K$ independent reasoning traces $\\{t_1, \\ldots, t_K\\}$ by sampling at temperature $T$; each trace $t_i$ yields a candidate answer $a_i$. Second, the same LLM extracts a set of structured FOL constraints $C_i$ from each trace $t_i$. Third, constraints are deduplicated across traces by syntactic equivalence, and each unique constraint receives a weight equal to the number of traces that produced it. Fourth, the deduplicated constraint pool is formulated as a weighted partial MAX-SAT instance and solved by Z3 \\cite{demoura2008z3}. Each candidate answer is scored by the total weight of satisfied constraints, and the highest-scoring answer is selected.\n\nSelf-Consistency (SC) uses only the first stage: it selects $a^* = \\arg\\max_{a} \\sum_{i=1}^{K} \\mathbf{1}[a_i = a]$. SICA's additional signal comes from constraint satisfaction structure. Whether this signal provides discriminative power beyond vote counting is the central empirical question.\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\\centering\n\\small\n\\begin{tikzpicture}[\n    node distance=0.4cm and 0.35cm,\n    box/.style={draw, rounded corners=2pt, minimum height=0.6cm,\n                text width=1.6cm, align=center, font=\\scriptsize},\n    arr/.style={-{Stealth[length=4pt]}, thick},\n    darr/.style={-{Stealth[length=4pt]}, thick, densely dashed},\n    lbl/.style={font=\\tiny, text=gray!70!black},\n]\n\\node[box] (q) {Question $q$};\n\\node[box, right=of q] (sample) {Sample $K$\\\\traces};\n\\node[box, right=of sample] (extract) {Extract FOL\\\\constraints};\n\\node[box, right=of extract] (dedup) {Dedup.\\ +\\\\weight};\n\\node[box, right=of dedup] (maxsat) {MAX-SAT\\\\(Z3)};\n\n\\node[box, below=0.7cm of maxsat, fill=gray!12] (ans) {Answer $a^*$};\n\\node[box, below=0.7cm of sample, fill=gray!12] (sc) {Majority\\\\vote};\n\n\\draw[arr] (q) -- (sample);\n\\draw[arr] (sample) -- (extract);\n\\draw[arr] (extract) -- (dedup);\n\\draw[arr] (dedup) -- (maxsat);\n\\draw[arr] (maxsat) -- (ans);\n\\draw[arr] (sample) -- node[lbl, right, yshift=0pt] {SC} (sc);\n\n\\node[lbl, above=0.01cm of extract] {same LLM};\n\\node[lbl, above=0.01cm of maxsat] {SICA};\n\n\\draw[darr, gray!60] ([xshift=-0.1cm]dedup.south) -- ++(0,-0.35) node[lbl, below, yshift=-0.05cm] {oracle: gold FOL};\n\\end{tikzpicture}\n\\caption{The SICA pipeline. Both SC and SICA sample $K$ traces. SC selects the majority answer directly. SICA extracts FOL constraints from each trace, deduplicates, and solves a MAX-SAT instance via Z3. Dashed arrow: the oracle variant substitutes gold FOL annotations.}\n\\label{fig:pipeline}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\subsection{Constraint Extraction}\n\\label{sec:constraint-extraction}\n\nFor each trace $t_i$, the same LLM that generated $t_i$ is prompted to extract structured FOL constraints. While we prompt for FOL-style formalizations, the extracted constraints are predominantly propositional ground clauses without quantifiers, reflecting instruction-scale model capabilities. The extraction prompt requests JSON output containing the constraint type, a human-readable expression, and a Z3-compatible formula string. Each constraint $c$ is associated with its source trace $t_i$ and the answer $a_i$ that trace produced. The full prompt template is in Appendix~\\ref{app:prompts}.\n\nWe define the \\emph{extraction rate} as the fraction of traces yielding at least one parseable constraint. Traces with no valid constraints are excluded from MAX-SAT but still contribute answers to the candidate pool. Deduplication proceeds by syntactic equivalence: each unique constraint $c_m$ receives weight $w_m$ equal to the number of distinct traces that produced it.\n\n\\subsection{Weighted Partial MAX-SAT Formulation}\n\\label{sec:maxsat}\n\nLet $\\mathcal{A}(q) = \\{a : a \\in \\{a_1, \\ldots, a_K\\}\\}$ denote the set of distinct candidate answers for question $q$, and let $\\mathcal{C} = \\{c_1, \\ldots, c_M\\}$ denote the deduplicated constraint pool with weights $\\{w_1, \\ldots, w_M\\}$.\n\n\\paragraph{MAX-SAT instance.} Each unique constraint $c_m$ serves as a soft clause with weight $w_m$. The objective is to find the largest-weight satisfiable subset:\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{eq:maxsat}\n\\mathcal{C}^* = \\arg\\max_{\\mathcal{S} \\subseteq \\mathcal{C}} \\sum_{c \\in \\mathcal{S}} w_c \\quad \\text{s.t.} \\quad \\mathcal{S} \\text{ is satisfiable.}\n\\end{equation}\nZ3's optimization engine solves this with a 10-second per-problem timeout.\n\n\\paragraph{Answer scoring.} Each candidate answer $a \\in \\mathcal{A}(q)$ is scored by:\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{eq:score}\n\\text{score}(a) = \\sum_{c \\in \\mathcal{C}^*} w_c \\cdot \\sigma(c, a),\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $\\sigma(c, a) \\in \\{0, 1\\}$ is determined by Z3: $\\sigma(c, a) = 1$ if constraint $c$ is satisfiable under the assignment implied by answer $a$. Each constraint is evaluated against every candidate, so a constraint from one trace can support or exclude answers from other traces. The selected answer is $a^* = \\arg\\max_{a \\in \\mathcal{A}} \\text{score}(a)$.\n\n\\paragraph{Degeneration under non-discriminative constraints.}\nIn practice, self-extracted constraints are tightly coupled to their source answer: $c_m$ derived from trace $t_i$ typically entails $a_i$ ($\\sigma(c_m, a_i) \\approx 1$). When constraints lack discriminative power across candidates, the score function degenerates:\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{eq:degenerate}\n\\text{score}(a) \\approx \\sum_{\\substack{c \\in \\mathcal{C}^* \\\\ \\text{source}(c) \\to a}} w_c,\n\\end{equation}\nwhich reduces to a weighted count of traces supporting $a$, equivalent to majority voting when weights are uniform. The ablation in \\S\\ref{sec:ablation} confirms this empirically: MAX-SAT, count-only, and random-weight baselines produce nearly identical accuracy.\n\n\\subsection{The $C_0$ Diagnostic}\n\\label{sec:c0}\n\nWe define the multi-candidate rate $C_0$ as the fraction of questions for which $K$ sampled traces produce more than one distinct answer:\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{eq:c0}\nC_0 = \\frac{|\\{q \\in \\mathcal{Q} : |\\mathcal{A}(q)| > 1\\}|}{|\\mathcal{Q}|}.\n\\end{equation}\n\n$C_0$ is a zero-cost diagnostic computable before any constraint extraction. When $C_0$ falls below 5\\%, nearly all questions are answered unanimously, and SICA produces the same output as SC by construction. High $C_0$ does not guarantee improvement, as it merely ensures disagreement exists without ensuring constraints can resolve it. $C_0$ serves as a necessary-condition screening criterion for practitioners considering symbolic aggregation.\n\n\\subsection{Scope and Limitations}\n\\label{sec:scope}\n\nSICA as evaluated here uses \\emph{same-model self-extraction}: the same LLM generates traces and extracts constraints. This isolates whether an LLM's own reasoning can be usefully formalized for aggregation. Our evaluation does not cover trained extractors, external provers, or cross-model setups. Published methods achieving positive results through different mechanisms \\citep{xu2026dylos, li2025aristotle, wang2025fover, luo2025logicagent} are complementary to our findings. An oracle variant (\\S\\ref{sec:oracle}) disentangles extraction quality from aggregation effectiveness.\n",

Self-extracted SICA provides no statistically significant improvement over Self-Consistency in any tested condition, with accuracy gaps ranging from $-3.3$ to $+3.3$\\,pp. The oracle experiment, which replaces self-extraction with gold FOL annotations verified by Z3, achieves $+8.82$ percentage points over SC ($p < 0.001$). This result causally localizes the failure to extraction quality: the MAX-SAT aggregation mechanism is sound when supplied with high-quality constraints, but same-model self-extraction cannot produce them. We identify this as a \\emph{capability trap}: because the reasoning model also extracts the constraints, those constraints inherit the same biases that produced potentially flawed answers and carry no independent discriminative signal. The failure is not one of aggregation design but of the circular dependency between generation and verification within a single model.\n\nThe practical consequences are substantial. Only 11.5\\% of self-extracted constraints evaluate differently across candidate answers; the remainder encode shared domain facts satisfied equally by every candidate. MAX-SAT agrees with count-only aggregation on 803 of 804 predictions, which confirms that satisfiability structure adds nothing when constraints are non-discriminative. Constraint extraction accounts for 48.7\\% of total pipeline time and roughly doubles computational cost for zero expected accuracy benefit. For practitioners who evaluate constraint-based voting, the multi-candidate rate $C_0$ serves as a zero-cost diagnostic: it is computable from trace samples alone, before any investment in constraint extraction or solver invocation. Low $C_0$ rules out any possible SICA gain by construction, and high $C_0$ signals the need for a small-scale constraint quality audit before full deployment.\n\nThe $+8.82$\\,pp oracle gap quantifies recoverable potential and points to three concrete paths forward.

Good, C1, C2, W2, W3, W4 are done. Now I need to do I1 and I3.

I1: Add "(validation split)" after FOLIO in experiments.tex
I3: Fix MATH-500 reference in Appendix

For I1, I need to find where FOLIO is first mentioned in experiments.tex and add "(validation split)". Looking at experiments.tex:

Line 11: "FOLIO~\cite{han2022folio} provides formal logic problems with gold FOL annotations ($n=204$)"

I should add "validation split" after FOLIO or after n=204.


Now for I3, I need to remove MATH-500 from the appendix since we don't actually use it in our experiments. There are three places where it appears: in the initial list of mathematical reasoning datasets, in a description of which datasets were used, and in another reference further down. I'll remove it from all three locations.

Table~\\ref{tab:power} reports the three conditions with $n \\geq 200$, which constitute our confirmatory analyses. The remaining six conditions ($n \\leq 60$) yield infinite MDE due to insufficient discordant pairs and serve only as regime characterization.\n\n\\begin{table}[h]\n\\centering\n\\small\n\\begin{tabular}{lrrrrr}\n\\toprule\n\\textbf{Condition} & $n$ & \\textbf{MDE} & \\textbf{Obs.\\ $\\Delta$} & \\textbf{Obs.\\ Pow.} \\\\\n\\midrule\nQwen-14B FOLIO+PW   & 804 & 1.86pp & $+$0.25pp & 5.7\\%  \\\\\nLLaMA-8B StrategyQA  & 200 & 4.64pp & $+$2.00pp & 20.6\\% \\\\\nLLaMA-8B FOLIO       & 204 & 4.84pp & $-$2.45pp & 18.6\\% \\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}\n\\caption{Power analysis for confirmatory conditions ($n \\geq 200$). MDE = minimum detectable effect at 80\\% power. All observed effects fall below their respective MDEs, and observed power remains below 21\\% in every case.}\n\\label{tab:power}\n\\end{table}\n\nThe largest study (Qwen-14B, $n{=}804$, 30 discordant pairs) can detect effects as small as 1.86pp, yet the observed $\\Delta$ of $+$0.25pp is an order of magnitude smaller. The two LLaMA-8B conditions require effects of 4.64pp and 4.84pp to reach significance; neither observed $\\Delta$ approaches these thresholds. All three conditions are consistent with the null hypothesis that SICA provides no accuracy gain over self-consistency.\n\n\n\\section{Bootstrap Confidence Intervals}\n\\label{app:bootstrap}\n\nWe compute 95\\% confidence intervals for $\\Delta(\\text{SICA} - \\text{SC})$ via 10{,}000 bootstrap resamples (percentile method, seed 42). Table~\\ref{tab:bootstrap} reports the results for the three confirmatory conditions.\n\n\\begin{table}[h]\n\\centering\n\\small\n\\begin{tabular}{lrrl}\n\\toprule\n\\textbf{Condition} & $n$ & \\textbf{Obs.\\ $\\Delta$} & \\textbf{95\\% CI} \\\\\n\\midrule\nQwen-14B FOLIO+PW   & 804 & $+$0.25pp & [$-$1.12, $+$1.62] \\\\\nLLaMA-8B StrategyQA  & 200 & $+$2.00pp & [$-$1.50, $+$5.50] \\\\\nLLaMA-8B FOLIO       & 204 & $-$2.45pp & [$-$5.88, $+$0.98] \\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}\n\\caption{Bootstrap 95\\% confidence intervals for $\\Delta(\\text{SICA} - \\text{SC})$ in percentage points. All intervals include zero, consistent with no reliable accuracy difference.}\n\\label{tab:bootstrap}\n\\end{table}\n\nAll three intervals contain zero. The narrowest interval (Qwen-14B, [$-$1.12, $+$1.62]) rules out practically meaningful gains ($>$2pp) even in the most favorable case. The widest interval (LLaMA-8B FOLIO, [$-$5.88, $+$0.98]) skews negative, indicating that SICA may slightly hurt accuracy in this condition. These results corroborate the McNemar tests and power analysis: no condition provides evidence that symbolic constraint aggregation improves over majority voting.\n",

Table~\\ref{tab:power} reports the three conditions with $n \\geq 200$, which constitute our confirmatory analyses. The remaining six conditions ($n \\leq 60$) yield infinite MDE due to insufficient discordant pairs and serve only as regime characterization.\n\n\\begin{table}[h]\n\\centering\n\\small\n\\begin{tabular}{lrrrrr}\n\\toprule\n\\textbf{Condition} & $n$ & \\textbf{MDE} & \\textbf{Obs.\\ $\\Delta$} & \\textbf{Obs.\\ Pow.} \\\\\n\\midrule\nQwen-14B FOLIO+PW   & 804 & 1.86pp & $+$0.25pp & 5.7\\%  \\\\\nLLaMA-8B StrategyQA  & 200 & 4.64pp & $+$2.00pp & 20.6\\% \\\\\nLLaMA-8B FOLIO       & 204 & 4.84pp & $-$2.45pp & 18.6\\% \\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}\n\\caption{Power analysis for confirmatory conditions ($n \\geq 200$). MDE = minimum detectable effect at 80\\% power. All observed effects fall below their respective MDEs, and observed power remains below 21\\% in every case.}\n\\label{tab:power}\n\\end{table}\n\nThe largest study (Qwen-14B, $n{=}804$, 30 discordant pairs) can detect effects as small as 1.86pp, yet the observed $\\Delta$ of $+$0.25pp is an order of magnitude smaller. The two LLaMA-8B conditions require effects of 4.64pp and 4.84pp to reach significance; neither observed $\\Delta$ approaches these thresholds. All three conditions are consistent with the null hypothesis that SICA provides no accuracy gain over self-consistency.\n\n\n\\section{Bootstrap Confidence Intervals}\n\\label{app:bootstrap}\n\nWe compute 95\\% confidence intervals for $\\Delta(\\text{SICA} - \\text{SC})$ via 10{,}000 bootstrap resamples (percentile method, seed 42). Table~\\ref{tab:bootstrap} reports the results for the three confirmatory conditions.\n\n\\begin{table}[h]\n\\centering\n\\small\n\\begin{tabular}{lrrl}\n\\toprule\n\\textbf{Condition} & $n$ & \\textbf{Obs.\\ $\\Delta$} & \\textbf{95\\% CI} \\\\\n\\midrule\nQwen-14B FOLIO+PW   & 804 & $+$0.25pp & [$-$1.12, $+$1.62] \\\\\nLLaMA-8B StrategyQA  & 200 & $+$2.00pp & [$-$1.50, $+$5.50] \\\\\nLLaMA-8B FOLIO       & 204 & $-$2.45pp & [$-$5.88, $+$0.98] \\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}\n\\caption{Bootstrap 95\\% confidence intervals for $\\Delta(\\text{SICA} - \\text{SC})$ in percentage points. All intervals include zero, consistent with no reliable accuracy difference.}\n\\label{tab:bootstrap}\n\\end{table}\n\nAll three intervals contain zero. The narrowest interval (Qwen-14B, [$-$1.12, $+$1.62]) rules out practically meaningful gains ($>$2pp) even in the most favorable case. The widest interval (LLaMA-8B FOLIO, [$-$5.88, $+$0.98]) skews negative, indicating that SICA may slightly hurt accuracy in this condition. These results corroborate the McNemar tests and power analysis: no condition provides evidence that symbolic constraint aggregation improves over majority voting.\n",

Table~\\ref{tab:power} reports the three conditions with $n \\geq 200$, which constitute our confirmatory analyses. The remaining six conditions ($n \\leq 60$) yield infinite MDE due to insufficient discordant pairs and serve only as regime characterization.\n\n\\begin{table}[h]\n\\centering\n\\small\n\\begin{tabular}{lrrrrr}\n\\toprule\n\\textbf{Condition} & $n$ & \\textbf{MDE} & \\textbf{Obs.\\ $\\Delta$} & \\textbf{Obs.\\ Pow.} \\\\\n\\midrule\nQwen-14B FOLIO+PW   & 804 & 1.86pp & $+$0.25pp & 5.7\\%  \\\\\nLLaMA-8B StrategyQA  & 200 & 4.64pp & $+$2.00pp & 20.6\\% \\\\\nLLaMA-8B FOLIO       & 204 & 4.84pp & $-$2.45pp & 18.6\\% \\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}\n\\caption{Power analysis for confirmatory conditions ($n \\geq 200$). MDE = minimum detectable effect at 80\\% power. All observed effects fall below their respective MDEs, and observed power remains below 21\\% in every case.}\n\\label{tab:power}\n\\end{table}\n\nThe largest study (Qwen-14B, $n{=}804$, 30 discordant pairs) can detect effects as small as 1.86pp, yet the observed $\\Delta$ of $+$0.25pp is an order of magnitude smaller. The two LLaMA-8B conditions require effects of 4.64pp and 4.84pp to reach significance; neither observed $\\Delta$ approaches these thresholds. All three conditions are consistent with the null hypothesis that SICA provides no accuracy gain over self-consistency.\n\n\n\\section{Bootstrap Confidence Intervals}\n\\label{app:bootstrap}\n\nWe compute 95\\% confidence intervals for $\\Delta(\\text{SICA} - \\text{SC})$ via 10{,}000 bootstrap resamples (percentile method, seed 42). Table~\\ref{tab:bootstrap} reports the results for the three confirmatory conditions.\n\n\\begin{table}[h]\n\\centering\n\\small\n\\begin{tabular}{lrrl}\n\\toprule\n\\textbf{Condition} & $n$ & \\textbf{Obs.\\ $\\Delta$} & \\textbf{95\\% CI} \\\\\n\\midrule\nQwen-14B FOLIO+PW   & 804 & $+$0.25pp & [$-$1.12, $+$1.62] \\\\\nLLaMA-8B StrategyQA  & 200 & $+$2.00pp & [$-$1.50, $+$5.50] \\\\\nLLaMA-8B FOLIO       & 204 & $-$2.45pp & [$-$5.88, $+$0.98] \\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}\n\\caption{Bootstrap 95\\% confidence intervals for $\\Delta(\\text{SICA} - \\text{SC})$ in percentage points. All intervals include zero, consistent with no reliable accuracy difference.}\n\\label{tab:bootstrap}\n\\end{table}\n\nAll three intervals contain zero. The narrowest interval (Qwen-14B, [$-$1.12, $+$1.62]) rules out practically meaningful gains ($>$2pp) even in the most favorable case. The widest interval (LLaMA-8B FOLIO, [$-$5.88, $+$0.98]) skews negative, indicating that SICA may slightly hurt accuracy in this condition. These results corroborate the McNemar tests and power analysis: no condition provides evidence that symbolic constraint aggregation improves over majority voting.\n",

The seven smaller conditions ($n \\leq 60$) are consistent with this null pattern: $\\Delta$ ranges from $-3.33$ to $+3.33$~pp, all nonsignificant. QwQ-32B on AIME produces identical outputs ($C_0 = 2.6\\%$), confirming that reasoning-specialized models leave no room for SICA to operate.\n\nAcross eleven conditions, six models, and more than 1,300 instances, SICA does not improve upon majority voting. The oracle row tells a different story: gold FOL constraints yield $+8.82$~pp over SC ($p < 0.001$), proving the aggregation mechanism works when given discriminative constraints.\n\n\n\\subsection{Oracle Control: The Aggregation Mechanism Is Effective}\n\\label{sec:oracle}\n\nWe construct an oracle variant that replaces self-extracted constraints with gold FOL annotations from FOLIO ($n = 204$). Z3 evaluates ground-truth formulas against each candidate answer; all other pipeline components remain identical.\n\nOracle-SICA achieves 88.24\\% accuracy versus 79.41\\% for both SC and standard SICA. The $+8.82$~pp gain is highly significant (McNemar $p = 6.15 \\times 10^{-5}$). Z3 checks on gold annotations agree with ground-truth labels for 193/204 problems (94.6\\%). This establishes that the MAX-SAT mechanism is sound given correct constraints, and that the bottleneck lies entirely in extraction quality.\n\n\n\\subsection{Capability Trap Diagnostics}\n\\label{sec:diagnostics}\n\nWhy does SICA fail? Full per-condition metrics are in Appendix Table~\\ref{tab:capability_trap}. $C_0$ ranges from 2.6\\% (QwQ-32B) to 61.8\\% (LLaMA-3.1-8B on FOLIO). For reasoning-specialized models, over 97\\% of questions receive unanimous answers, so SICA reduces to SC by construction. For instruction-tuned models, higher $C_0$ creates opportunities for SICA to differ from SC, yet $\\Delta$ remains nonsignificant everywhere (Figure~\\ref{fig:diagnostics}b). Extraction rates exceed 0.80 and contradiction rates stay below 7\\%, so the pipeline is mechanically functional. The problem is extraction vacuity: constraints are syntactically valid but semantically redundant with their source answers. Even the highest-quality condition (LLaMA-3.1-8B on FOLIO, extraction rate 0.94) yields $\\Delta = -2.45$~pp. A temperature ablation ($T \\in \\{0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 1.0\\}$, Qwen2.5-14B, $n{=}60$) shows $C_0$ increasing monotonically from 30.0\\% ($T{=}0.3$) to 38.3\\% ($T{=}0.5$), 40.0\\% ($T{=}0.7$), and 43.3\\% ($T{=}1.0$), yet $\\Delta$ never exceeds zero: 0.0~pp at $T{=}0.3$, 0.0~pp at $T{=}0.5$, $-3.33$~pp at $T{=}0.7$ ($n{=}60$, n.s.), and 0.0~pp at $T{=}1.0$ (Figure~\\ref{fig:diagnostics}a). Even at the default temperature $T{=}0.7$, SICA does not outperform SC.\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\\centering\n\\begin{subfigure}[b]{0.48\\columnwidth}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{fig2_capability_scatter.pdf}\n\\caption{Vote entropy vs.\\ constraint exclusion rate (Qwen2.5-14B, $n{=}307$ multi-candidate problems).}\n\\label{fig:capability_scatter}\n\\end{subfigure}\n\\hfill\n\\begin{subfigure}[b]{0.48\\columnwidth}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{fig3_operating_regime.pdf}\n\\caption{$C_0$ vs.\\ SICA$-$SC gap across all conditions.}\n\\label{fig:operating_regime}\n\\end{subfigure}\n\\caption{Capability trap diagnostics. (a) High vote entropy does not benefit from constraint filtering. (b) The accuracy gap stays centered at zero regardless of answer diversity.}\n\\label{fig:diagnostics}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\subsection{Constraint Ablation: MAX-SAT Degenerates to Counting}\n\\label{sec:ablation}\n\nIf self-extracted constraints are non-discriminative, MAX-SAT should produce the same predictions as baselines ignoring satisfiability. We test three variants on Qwen2.5-14B (FOLIO + ProofWriter, $n = 804$): full SICA, count-only (most constraints wins, ignoring satisfiability), and random-weight (randomized weights before solving).\n\n\\begin{table}[t]\n\\centering\n\\small\n\\caption{Constraint ablation (Qwen2.5-14B, $n = 804$, FOLIO + ProofWriter). Agreement: predictions identical to SICA (MAX-SAT) out of 804.}\n\\label{tab:ablation}\n\\begin{tabular}{@{}lrc@{}}\n\\toprule\nAggregation & Acc.\\ (\\%) & Agreement w/ SICA \\\\\n\\midrule\nSC (majority vote) & 76.24 & 773\\,/\\,804 \\\\\nSICA (MAX-SAT) & 76.49 & --- \\\\\nCount-only & 76.62 & 803\\,/\\,804 \\\\\nRandom-weight & 75.87 & 785\\,/\\,804 \\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\n\nMAX-SAT and count-only aggregation agree on 803 of 804 predictions (Table~\\ref{tab:ablation}), confirming that the satisfiability solver contributes nothing beyond vote counting. The single disagreement occurs on a tie case. While SICA and SC disagree on 31 problems (3.9\\%), these disagreements approximately cancel: 16 SICA wins versus 14 SC wins, yielding a net gain of only $+$2 problems. Self-extracted constraints carry no discriminative signal beyond vote counts. The oracle control ($+8.82$~pp) confirms that the aggregation mechanism works given independent problem structure; self-extracted constraints simply fail to provide it.\n",

3	We evaluated Symbolic Invariant Consensus Aggregation across five model families (7B to 32B parameters) and three reasoning domains with more than 1,300 total instances. Self-extracted SICA provides no statistically significant improvement over Self-Consistency in any tested condition, with accuracy gaps ranging from $-3.3$ to $+3.3$\,pp. The oracle experiment, which replaces self-extraction with gold FOL annotations verified by Z3, achieves $+8.82$ percentage points over SC ($p < 0.001$). This result causally localizes the failure to extraction quality: the MAX-SAT aggregation mechanism is sound when supplied with high-quality constraints, but same-model self-extraction cannot produce them. We identify this as a \emph{capability trap}: because the reasoning model also extracts the constraints, those constraints inherit the same biases that produced potentially flawed answers and carry no independent discriminative signal. The failure is not one of aggregation design but of the circular dependency between generation and verification within a single model.
4	
5	The practical consequences are substantial. Only 11.5\% of self-extracted constraints evaluate differently across candidate answers; the remainder encode shared domain facts satisfied equally by every candidate. MAX-SAT agrees with count-only aggregation on 803 of 804 predictions, which confirms that satisfiability structure adds nothing when constraints are non-discriminative. Constraint extraction accounts for 48.7\% of total pipeline time and roughly doubles computational cost for zero expected accuracy benefit. For practitioners who evaluate constraint-based voting, the multi-candidate rate $C_0$ serves as a zero-cost diagnostic: it is computable from trace samples alone, before any investment in constraint extraction or solver invocation. Low $C_0$ rules out any possible SICA gain by construction, and high $C_0$ signals the need for a small-scale constraint quality audit before full deployment.

7	The $+8.82$\,pp oracle gap quantifies recoverable potential; trained extractors, cross-model pipelines, and external provers each target the extraction bottleneck directly, as discussed in \S\ref{sec:discussion}.

All fixes are verified:

1. **C1** (CRITICAL): Three bib entries fixed with complete author lists:
   - `diverseaware2025`: Lyu et al., ICLR 2026
   - `satbench2025`: Wei et al., EMNLP 2025
   - `llmmeets_cp2025`: Bonlarron et al., IJCAI 2025

2. **C2** (CRITICAL): `deepseek2025r1` removed from bib, all `\cite{deepseek2025r1}` replaced with `\cite{guo2025deepseekr1}` in tex files. Zero remaining references.


3. **W2**: Answer assertion mechanism explained in method.tex §3.3.
4. **W3**: Added fifth limitation about alternative prompting strategies for extraction.
5. **W4**: Conclusion P3 compressed to 1 sentence referencing §Discussion.
6. **I1**: "(validation split)" added after FOLIO in experiments.tex.
7. **I3**: MATH-500 references removed from appendix.tex.

Now checking if discussion.tex has a `\label{sec:discussion}` tag.

[Director 指令] 验证引用 xu2026dylos（DyLoS）的真实性。

当前 bib 条目：
```
@inproceedings{xu2026dylos,
  title={Adaptive {LLM}-Symbolic Reasoning via Dynamic Logical Solver Composition ({DyLoS})},
  author={Xu, Yifan and others},
  booktitle={EACL},
  year={2026}
}
```

Paper Agent 线上搜不到这篇论文。请用 WebSearch 验证：
1. 这篇论文是否存在？搜索 "DyLoS adaptive LLM symbolic reasoning" 和 "Xu Yifan DyLoS EACL 2026"
2. 如果存在，补全完整作者列表
3. 如果不存在（疑似幻觉引用），找一篇真实的、主题相近的替代论文（adaptive neuro-symbolic solver selection / multi-paradigm LLM-solver integration），提供完整 bib 条目

该引用在 introduction.tex、method.tex、related_work.tex 三处使用，描述 "adaptively selects among multiple solver paradigms"。如果需要替换，需要提供一篇真实论文来填这个位置。

汇报：(a) 是否真实 (b) 如果真实给完整作者 (c) 如果虚假给替代 bib 条目

    "content": "- update-config: Use this skill to configure the Claude Code harness via settings.json. Automated behaviors (\"from now on when X\", \"each time X\", \"whenever X\", \"before/after X\") require hooks configured in settings.json - the harness executes these, not Claude, so memory/preferences cannot fulfill them. Also use for: permissions (\"allow X\", \"add permission\", \"move permission to\"), env vars (\"set X=Y\"), hook troubleshooting, or any changes to settings.json/settings.local.json files. Examples: \"allow npm commands\", \"add bq permission to global settings\", \"move permission to user settings\", \"set DEBUG=true\", \"when claude stops show X\". For simple settings like theme/model, suggest the /config command.\n- keybindings-help: Use when the user wants to customize keyboard shortcuts, rebind keys, add chord bindings, or modify ~/.claude/keybindings.json. Examples: \"rebind ctrl+s\", \"add a chord shortcut\", \"change the submit key\", \"customize keybindings\".\n- simplify: Review changed code for reuse, quality, and efficiency, then fix any issues found.\n- fewer-permission-prompts: Scan your transcripts for common read-only Bash and MCP tool calls, then add a prioritized allowlist to project .claude/settings.json to reduce permission prompts.\n- loop: Run a prompt or slash command on a recurring interval (e.g. /loop 5m /foo). Omit the interval to let the model self-pace. - When the user wants to set up a recurring task, poll for status, or run something repeatedly on an interval (e.g. \"check the deploy every 5 minutes\", \"keep running /babysit-prs\"). Do NOT invoke for one-off tasks.\n- schedule: Create, update, list, or run scheduled remote agents (routines) that execute on a cron schedule. - When the user wants to schedule a recurring remote agent, set up automated tasks, create a cron job for Claude Code, or manage their scheduled agents/routines. Also use when the user wants a one-time scheduled run (\"run this once at 3pm\", \"remind me to check X tomorrow\").\n- claude-api: Build, debug, and optimize Claude API / Anthropic SDK apps. Apps built with this skill should include prompt caching. Also handles migrating existing Claude API code between Claude model versions (4.5 → 4.6, 4.6 → 4.7, retired-model replacements).\nTRIGGER when: code imports `anthropic`/`@anthropic-ai/sdk`; user asks for the Claude API, Anthropic SDK, or Managed Agents; user adds/modifies/tunes a Claude feature (caching, thinking, compaction, tool use, batch, files, citations, memory) or model (Opus/Sonnet/Haiku) in a file; questions about prompt caching / cache hit rate in an Anthropic SDK project.\nSKIP: file imports `openai`/other-provider SDK, filename like `*-openai.py`/`*-generic.py`, provider-neutral code, general programming/ML.\n- init: Initialize a new CLAUDE.md file with codebase documentation\n- review: Review a pull request\n- security-review: Complete a security review of the pending changes on the current branch",

**Verification result: The paper EXISTS, but the author name in your citation is WRONG.**

- **Title:** Adaptive LLM-Symbolic Reasoning via Dynamic Logical Solver Composition (DyLoS)
- **Actual authors:** Lei Xu, Pierre Beckmann, Marco Valentino, and Andre Freitas

- **ACL Anthology:** [2026.eacl-long.54](https://aclanthology.org/2026.eacl-long.54/)
- **Description:** An adaptive, multi-paradigm neuro-symbolic inference framework that automatically identifies formal reasoning strategies from natural language problems and dynamically selects among specialized formal logical solvers (LP, FOL, CSP, SMT) via autoformalization interfaces, outperforming GPT-4o and DeepSeek-V3.1 baselines.

**What needs fixing:** The first author is **Xu, Lei** (not "Xu, Yifan"). The full author list should be: Lei Xu, Pierre Beckmann, Marco Valentino, Andre Freitas. No replacement paper is needed since the paper itself is real; only the author field in the citation requires correction.

[Director 指令] 论文最终 proofread + 质量检查任务（不等审稿报告，现在做）：

1. **全文 proofread**：读 docs/paper/ 下所有 .tex 文件，检查语法、拼写、指代不清的代词（this/that/it）。列出发现的问题但**不要修改**，先汇报。

2. **图表质量检查**：编译 main.pdf 后检查：
   - Figure 1 (TikZ pipeline) 是否清晰可读
   - Figure 2a (capability scatter) 和 2b (operating regime) 的 PDF 文件是否存在且正确引用
   - Table 1/2/3 的数字是否与 registry 数据一致

3. **Appendix 完整性**：确认 4 个 appendix section 都存在且有内容：
   - A: Prompt templates
   - B: Capability trap diagnostics table
   - C: Power analysis
   - D: Bootstrap CIs

4. **引用完整性**：运行 bibtex 检查是否有 unused 或 undefined citations。

汇报格式：每项 PASS/FAIL + 具体发现。不改文件。

The Director wants a comprehensive proofread and quality check. Let me:

1. Read all .tex files for proofreading
2. Check figure files exist
3. Verify appendix sections
4. Check citations

Let me start by reading all tex files and checking for figure files in parallel.

2	Neuro-symbolic methods propose extracting first-order logic (FOL) constraints from Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning traces to improve answer aggregation beyond majority voting. Whether the reasoning model itself can produce useful constraints through self-extraction has not been systematically evaluated. If self-extraction works, it eliminates the need for trained verifiers, external provers, or domain-specific infrastructure. We evaluate Symbolic Invariant Consensus Aggregation (SICA), which formulates a weighted partial Maximum Satisfiability (MAX-SAT) problem over self-extracted FOL constraints, across six models from five model families (7B to 32B parameters) and three reasoning domains with more than 1,300 total instances. We include an oracle control that replaces self-extraction with gold FOL annotations verified by Z3 to isolate extraction quality from aggregation effectiveness. Self-extracted SICA provides no statistically significant improvement over Self-Consistency (SC) in any tested condition, with accuracy gaps ranging from $-3.3$ to $+3.3$ percentage points. The oracle variant achieves $+8.82$ percentage points over SC ($p < 0.001$), which proves the aggregation mechanism is sound when supplied with high-quality constraints. We characterize this failure as a \emph{capability trap}: because the same model that produced potentially flawed reasoning also extracts the constraints, those constraints are semantically coupled to their source answers and carry no independent discriminative signal. Only 11.5\% of self-extracted constraints evaluate differently across candidate answers. This result establishes that same-model constraint extraction cannot improve LLM answer aggregation without independent sources of formal knowledge.

1	\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
2	
3	Neuro-symbolic methods that augment large language model (LLM) reasoning with formal solvers have demonstrated gains on logical reasoning benchmarks. Logic-LM \citep{pan2023logiclm} and LINC \citep{olausson2023linc} delegate formalization to external provers. More recent systems route problems to specialized solver paradigms \citep{xu2026dylos}, apply logic-complete decomposition \citep{li2025aristotle}, train dedicated first-order logic (FOL) verifiers on supervised data \citep{wang2025fover}, or employ multi-perspective grounding \citep{luo2025logicagent}. These systems report positive results on formal reasoning benchmarks, but a critical commonality unites them: each introduces capabilities beyond the reasoning model itself, whether trained verifiers, multi-paradigm solver selection, or external knowledge bases. The external machinery is effective but imposes practical costs in training data, integration complexity, and domain-specific engineering that limits portability.
4	
5	These results raise a direct question: can the reasoning model itself extract useful formal constraints from its own traces? Same-model self-extraction would require no training data, no external prover, and no second model. Practitioners could augment any LLM with symbolic verification by adding a single extraction prompt and a satisfiability solver, with no domain-specific infrastructure. If successful, this approach would provide a lightweight, portable alternative to the external machinery that current systems require. Yet no prior work has systematically evaluated whether self-extraction produces constraints useful for answer aggregation, or characterized the conditions under which it succeeds or fails. This gap is consequential: the practical promise of neuro-symbolic reasoning hinges on whether the reasoning model alone can supply formal structure of sufficient quality, or whether external grounding is fundamentally required.
6	
7	Self-Consistency (SC) selects the most frequent answer across multiple chain-of-thought samples \citep{wang2023sc} and remains competitive across mathematical, logical, and commonsense reasoning \citep{chen2024usc, taubenfeld2025cisc}. SC treats traces as black boxes, discarding all intermediate reasoning. Each trace, however, contains intermediate steps, logical dependencies, and structural relationships that could in principle ground aggregation in formal logic, adding discriminative power beyond vote counting. This would also address SC's known scaling plateau, where additional traces yield diminishing returns \citep{loo2025reevaluating}.
8	
9	We evaluate this possibility through Symbolic Invariant Consensus Aggregation (SICA), a pipeline that extracts FOL constraints from $K$ reasoning traces produced by a single LLM, deduplicates by syntactic equivalence, and solves a weighted partial MAX-SAT problem via Z3 \citep{demoura2008z3}. The answer best supported by the largest satisfiable constraint subset is selected (Figure~\ref{fig:pipeline}). We test six models from five model families, spanning 7B to 32B parameters (Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct, Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, QwQ-32B), including instruction-tuned models, a reasoning-specialized model, and a distilled reasoning model, across three reasoning domains: formal logic (FOLIO \citep{han2022folio}, ProofWriter \citep{tafjord2021proofwriter}), commonsense (StrategyQA \citep{geva2021strategyqa}), and science (ARC-Challenge \citep{clark2018arc}), with supplementary probes on GSM8K \citep{cobbe2021gsm8k} and AIME 2024, totaling more than 1,300 instances. An oracle control on FOLIO ($n=204$) replaces self-extracted constraints with gold FOL annotations verified by Z3, isolating extraction quality from aggregation effectiveness following established methodology \citep{press2023compositionality}.
10	
11	Across all conditions, SICA provides no statistically significant improvement over SC, with accuracy gaps between $-3.3$ and $+3.3$\,pp. The oracle experiment yields a fundamentally different result: $+8.82$\,pp over SC (McNemar $p = 6.15 \times 10^{-5}$), confirming that the MAX-SAT mechanism is sound when given discriminative constraints. The bottleneck is extraction quality. Because the same model generates both answers and constraints, the extracted constraints are semantically coupled to their source answers and carry no independent signal. We term this the \emph{capability trap}: the model cannot formalize corrections to its own reasoning errors because extraction inherits the same biases that produced those errors. A constraint ablation confirms the diagnosis: MAX-SAT and count-only aggregation agree on 803 of 804 predictions, and SICA's 31 disagreements with SC approximately cancel (16 wins vs.\ 14 losses), yielding a net gain of only $+$2 problems (\S\ref{sec:ablation}). Manual analysis shows only 11.5\% of unique constraints evaluate differently across candidates; the remainder encode shared domain facts that contribute identical scores to every answer. Constraint extraction accounts for 48.7\% of total SICA pipeline time, roughly doubling wall-clock cost for zero expected accuracy gain.
12	
13	Our contributions are:
14	\begin{itemize}
15	\item We characterize the capability trap in same-model constraint extraction: across six models from five model families and three reasoning domains ($N > 1{,}300$), self-extracted SICA provides no statistically significant improvement over majority voting, and only 11.5\% of constraints evaluate differently across candidates (\S\ref{sec:diagnostics}, \S\ref{sec:ablation}).
16	\item We causally localize the failure via an oracle control: replacing self-extraction with gold FOL annotations yields $+8.82$\,pp over SC ($p < 0.001$), proving the aggregation mechanism is sound and the bottleneck lies entirely in extraction quality (\S\ref{sec:oracle}).
17	\item We quantify the recoverable gap: the $+8.82$\,pp oracle ceiling and the 48.7\% cost overhead of non-discriminative extraction jointly establish the barrier and the potential for future methods targeting the extraction bottleneck (\S\ref{sec:ablation}, \S\ref{sec:discussion}).
18	\item We propose the multi-candidate rate $C_0$ as a zero-cost, necessary-condition diagnostic for practitioners evaluating symbolic aggregation (\S\ref{sec:c0}).

1	\section{Method: The SICA Pipeline}
2	\label{sec:method}
3	
4	This section describes Symbolic Invariant Consensus Aggregation (SICA), which extracts first-order logic (FOL) constraints from multiple reasoning traces produced by a single LLM, formulates a weighted partial MAX-SAT problem, and selects the answer best supported by the satisfiable subset.
5	
6	\subsection{Overview}
7	\label{sec:method-overview}
8	
9	Given a question $q$, SICA proceeds in four stages. First, an LLM generates $K$ independent reasoning traces $\{t_1, \ldots, t_K\}$ by sampling at temperature $T$; each trace $t_i$ yields a candidate answer $a_i$. Second, the same LLM extracts a set of structured FOL constraints $C_i$ from each trace $t_i$. Third, constraints are deduplicated across traces by syntactic equivalence, and each unique constraint receives a weight equal to the number of traces that produced it. Fourth, the deduplicated constraint pool is formulated as a weighted partial MAX-SAT instance and solved by Z3 \cite{demoura2008z3}. Each candidate answer is scored by the total weight of satisfied constraints, and the highest-scoring answer is selected.
10	
11	Self-Consistency (SC) uses only the first stage: it selects $a^* = \arg\max_{a} \sum_{i=1}^{K} \mathbf{1}[a_i = a]$. SICA's additional signal comes from constraint satisfaction structure. Whether this signal provides discriminative power beyond vote counting is the central empirical question.

46	\label{fig:pipeline}
47	\end{figure}
48	
49	\subsection{Constraint Extraction}
50	\label{sec:constraint-extraction}
51	
52	For each trace $t_i$, the same LLM that generated $t_i$ is prompted to extract structured FOL constraints. While we prompt for FOL-style formalizations, the extracted constraints are predominantly propositional ground clauses without quantifiers, reflecting instruction-scale model capabilities. The extraction prompt requests JSON output containing the constraint type, a human-readable expression, and a Z3-compatible formula string. Each constraint $c$ is associated with its source trace $t_i$ and the answer $a_i$ that trace produced. The full prompt template is in Appendix~\ref{app:prompts}.
53	
54	We define the \emph{extraction rate} as the fraction of traces yielding at least one parseable constraint. Traces with no valid constraints are excluded from MAX-SAT but still contribute answers to the candidate pool. Deduplication proceeds by syntactic equivalence: each unique constraint $c_m$ receives weight $w_m$ equal to the number of distinct traces that produced it.
55	
56	\subsection{Weighted Partial MAX-SAT Formulation}
57	\label{sec:maxsat}
58	
59	Let $\mathcal{A}(q) = \{a : a \in \{a_1, \ldots, a_K\}\}$ denote the set of distinct candidate answers for question $q$, and let $\mathcal{C} = \{c_1, \ldots, c_M\}$ denote the deduplicated constraint pool with weights $\{w_1, \ldots, w_M\}$.
60	
61	\paragraph{MAX-SAT instance.} Each unique constraint $c_m$ serves as a soft clause with weight $w_m$. The objective is to find the largest-weight satisfiable subset:
62	\begin{equation}
63	\label{eq:maxsat}
64	\mathcal{C}^* = \arg\max_{\mathcal{S} \subseteq \mathcal{C}} \sum_{c \in \mathcal{S}} w_c \quad \text{s.t.} \quad \mathcal{S} \text{ is satisfiable.}
65	\end{equation}
66	Z3's optimization engine solves this with a 10-second per-problem timeout.
67	
68	\paragraph{Answer scoring.} Each candidate answer $a \in \mathcal{A}(q)$ is scored by:
69	\begin{equation}
70	\label{eq:score}
71	\text{score}(a) = \sum_{c \in \mathcal{C}^*} w_c \cdot \sigma(c, a),
72	\end{equation}
73	where $\sigma(c, a) \in \{0, 1\}$ is determined by Z3: $\sigma(c, a) = 1$ if constraint $c$ is satisfiable under the assignment implied by answer $a$. To ensure each candidate answer participates in scoring, the pipeline injects an \emph{answer assertion} constraint $\texttt{answer\_}a \mathrel{{=}{=}} \texttt{True}$ for each trace, with weight 1. This guarantees that every candidate receives a nonzero base score proportional to its vote count, making SICA a strict generalization of SC. Each constraint is evaluated against every candidate, so a constraint from one trace can support or exclude answers from other traces. The selected answer is $a^* = \arg\max_{a \in \mathcal{A}} \text{score}(a)$.
74	
75	\paragraph{Degeneration under non-discriminative constraints.}
76	In practice, self-extracted constraints are tightly coupled to their source answer: $c_m$ derived from trace $t_i$ typically entails $a_i$ ($\sigma(c_m, a_i) \approx 1$). When constraints lack discriminative power across candidates, the score function degenerates:
77	\begin{equation}
78	\label{eq:degenerate}
79	\text{score}(a) \approx \sum_{\substack{c \in \mathcal{C}^* \\ \text{source}(c) \to a}} w_c,
80	\end{equation}
81	which reduces to a weighted count of traces supporting $a$, equivalent to majority voting when weights are uniform. The ablation in \S\ref{sec:ablation} confirms this empirically: MAX-SAT, count-only, and random-weight baselines produce nearly identical accuracy.
82	
83	\subsection{The $C_0$ Diagnostic}
84	\label{sec:c0}
85	
86	We define the multi-candidate rate $C_0$ as the fraction of questions for which $K$ sampled traces produce more than one distinct answer:

88	\label{eq:c0}
89	C_0 = \frac{|\{q \in \mathcal{Q} : |\mathcal{A}(q)| > 1\}|}{|\mathcal{Q}|}.
90	\end{equation}
91	
92	$C_0$ is a zero-cost diagnostic computable before any constraint extraction. When $C_0$ falls below 5\%, nearly all questions are answered unanimously, and SICA produces the same output as SC by construction. High $C_0$ does not guarantee improvement, as it merely ensures disagreement exists without ensuring constraints can resolve it. $C_0$ serves as a necessary-condition screening criterion for practitioners considering symbolic aggregation.

94	\subsection{Scope and Limitations}
95	\label{sec:scope}
96	
97	SICA as evaluated here uses \emph{same-model self-extraction}: the same LLM generates traces and extracts constraints. This isolates whether an LLM's own reasoning can be usefully formalized for aggregation. Our evaluation does not cover trained extractors, external provers, or cross-model setups. Published methods achieving positive results through different mechanisms \citep{xu2026dylos, li2025aristotle, wang2025fover, luo2025logicagent} are complementary to our findings. An oracle variant (\S\ref{sec:oracle}) disentangles extraction quality from aggregation effectiveness.

First, an LLM generates $K$ independent reasoning traces $\\{t_1, \\ldots, t_K\\}$ by sampling at temperature $T$; each trace $t_i$ yields a candidate answer $a_i$. Second, the same LLM extracts a set of structured FOL constraints $C_i$ from each trace $t_i$. Third, constraints are deduplicated across traces by syntactic equivalence, and each unique constraint receives a weight equal to the number of traces that produced it. Fourth, the deduplicated constraint pool is formulated as a weighted partial MAX-SAT instance and solved by Z3 \\cite{demoura2008z3}. Each candidate answer is scored by the total weight of satisfied constraints, and the highest-scoring answer is selected.\n\nSelf-Consistency (SC) uses only the first stage: it selects $a^* = \\arg\\max_{a} \\sum_{i=1}^{K} \\mathbf{1}[a_i = a]$. SICA's additional signal comes from constraint satisfaction structure. Whether this signal provides discriminative power beyond vote counting is the central empirical question.\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\\centering\n\\small\n\\begin{tikzpicture}[\n    node distance=0.4cm and 0.35cm,\n    box/.style={draw, rounded corners=2pt, minimum height=0.6cm,\n                text width=1.6cm, align=center, font=\\scriptsize},\n    arr/.style={-{Stealth[length=4pt]}, thick},\n    darr/.style={-{Stealth[length=4pt]}, thick, densely dashed},\n    lbl/.style={font=\\tiny, text=gray!70!black},\n]\n\\node[box] (q) {Question $q$};\n\\node[box, right=of q] (sample) {Sample $K$\\\\traces};\n\\node[box, right=of sample] (extract) {Extract FOL\\\\constraints};\n\\node[box, right=of extract] (dedup) {Dedup.\\ +\\\\weight};\n\\node[box, right=of dedup] (maxsat) {MAX-SAT\\\\(Z3)};\n\n\\node[box, below=0.7cm of maxsat, fill=gray!12] (ans) {Answer $a^*$};\n\\node[box, below=0.7cm of sample, fill=gray!12] (sc) {Majority\\\\vote};\n\n\\draw[arr] (q) -- (sample);\n\\draw[arr] (sample) -- (extract);\n\\draw[arr] (extract) -- (dedup);\n\\draw[arr] (dedup) -- (maxsat);\n\\draw[arr] (maxsat) -- (ans);\n\\draw[arr] (sample) -- node[lbl, right, yshift=0pt] {SC} (sc);\n\n\\node[lbl, above=0.01cm of extract] {same LLM};\n\\node[lbl, above=0.01cm of maxsat] {SICA};\n\n\\draw[darr, gray!60] ([xshift=-0.1cm]dedup.south) -- ++(0,-0.35) node[lbl, below, yshift=-0.05cm] {oracle: gold FOL};\n\\end{tikzpicture}\n\\caption{The SICA pipeline.

Dashed arrow: the oracle variant substitutes gold FOL annotations.}\n\\label{fig:pipeline}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\subsection{Constraint Extraction}\n\\label{sec:constraint-extraction}\n\nFor each trace $t_i$, the same LLM that generated $t_i$ is prompted to extract structured FOL constraints. While we prompt for FOL-style formalizations, the extracted constraints are predominantly propositional ground clauses without quantifiers, reflecting instruction-scale model capabilities. The extraction prompt requests JSON output containing the constraint type, a human-readable expression, and a Z3-compatible formula string. Each constraint $c$ is associated with its source trace $t_i$ and the answer $a_i$ that trace produced. The full prompt template is in Appendix~\\ref{app:prompts}.\n\nWe define the \\emph{extraction rate} as the fraction of traces yielding at least one parseable constraint. Traces with no valid constraints are excluded from MAX-SAT but still contribute answers to the candidate pool. Deduplication proceeds by syntactic equivalence: each unique constraint $c_m$ receives weight $w_m$ equal to the number of distinct traces that produced it.\n\n\\subsection{Weighted Partial MAX-SAT Formulation}\n\\label{sec:maxsat}\n\nLet $\\mathcal{A}(q) = \\{a : a \\in \\{a_1, \\ldots, a_K\\}\\}$ denote the set of distinct candidate answers for question $q$, and let $\\mathcal{C} = \\{c_1, \\ldots, c_M\\}$ denote the deduplicated constraint pool with weights $\\{w_1, \\ldots, w_M\\}$.\n\n\\paragraph{MAX-SAT instance.} Each unique constraint $c_m$ serves as a soft clause with weight $w_m$. The objective is to find the largest-weight satisfiable subset:\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{eq:maxsat}\n\\mathcal{C}^* = \\arg\\max_{\\mathcal{S} \\subseteq \\mathcal{C}} \\sum_{c \\in \\mathcal{S}} w_c \\quad \\text{s.t.} \\quad \\mathcal{S} \\text{ is satisfiable.}\n\\end{equation}\nZ3's optimization engine solves this with a 10-second per-problem timeout.\n\n\\paragraph{Answer scoring.} Each candidate answer $a \\in \\mathcal{A}(q)$ is scored by:\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{eq:score}\n\\text{score}(a) = \\sum_{c \\in \\mathcal{C}^*} w_c \\cdot \\sigma(c, a),\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $\\sigma(c, a) \\in \\{0, 1\\}$ is determined by Z3: $\\sigma(c, a) = 1$ if constraint $c$ is satisfiable under the assignment implied by answer $a$. To ensure each candidate answer participates in scoring, the pipeline injects an \\emph{answer assertion} constraint $\\texttt{answer\\_}a \\mathrel{{=}{=}} \\texttt{True}$ for each trace, with weight 1. This guarantees that every candidate receives a nonzero base score proportional to its vote count, making SICA a strict generalization of SC. Each constraint is evaluated against every candidate, so a constraint from one trace can support or exclude answers from other traces. The selected answer is $a^* = \\arg\\max_{a \\in \\mathcal{A}} \\text{score}(a)$.\n\n\\paragraph{Degeneration under non-discriminative constraints.}\nIn practice, self-extracted constraints are tightly coupled to their source answer: $c_m$ derived from trace $t_i$ typically entails $a_i$ ($\\sigma(c_m, a_i) \\approx 1$). When constraints lack discriminative power across candidates, the score function degenerates:\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{eq:degenerate}\n\\text{score}(a) \\approx \\sum_{\\substack{c \\in \\mathcal{C}^* \\\\ \\text{source}(c) \\to a}} w_c,\n\\end{equation}\nwhich reduces to a weighted count of traces supporting $a$, equivalent to majority voting when weights are uniform. The ablation in \\S\\ref{sec:ablation} confirms this empirically: MAX-SAT, count-only, and random-weight baselines produce nearly identical accuracy.\n\n\\subsection{The $C_0$ Diagnostic}\n\\label{sec:c0}\n\nWe define the multi-candidate rate $C_0$ as the fraction of questions for which $K$ sampled traces produce more than one distinct answer:\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{eq:c0}\nC_0 = \\frac{|\\{q \\in \\mathcal{Q} : |\\mathcal{A}(q)| > 1\\}|}{|\\mathcal{Q}|}.\n\\end{equation}\n\n$C_0$ is a zero-cost diagnostic computable before any constraint extraction. When $C_0$ falls below 5\\%, nearly all questions are answered unanimously, and SICA produces the same output as SC by construction. High $C_0$ does not guarantee improvement, as it merely ensures disagreement exists without ensuring constraints can resolve it. $C_0$ serves as a necessary-condition screening criterion for practitioners considering symbolic aggregation.\n\n\\subsection{Scope and Limitations}\n\\label{sec:scope}\n\nSICA as evaluated here uses \\emph{same-model self-extraction}: the same LLM generates traces and extracts constraints.

1	\section{Experiments}
2	\label{sec:experiments}
3	
4	\subsection{Experimental Setup}
5	\label{sec:exp-setup}
6	
7	We evaluate SICA against Self-Consistency (SC) across six models from five families and three reasoning domains, with two additional benchmarks as operating-regime probes.
8	
9	\paragraph{Models.} We test Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct~\cite{yang2024qwen25}, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3~\cite{jiang2023mistral}, LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct~\cite{dubey2024llama3}, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B~\cite{guo2025deepseekr1}, and QwQ-32B~\cite{qwen2024qwq}, spanning 7B to 32B parameters. The Qwen2.5-7B condition enables within-family scaling comparison.
10	
11	\paragraph{Datasets.} FOLIO~\cite{han2022folio} (validation split) provides formal logic problems with gold FOL annotations ($n=204$), enabling the oracle control (\S\ref{sec:oracle}). ProofWriter~\cite{tafjord2021proofwriter} tests multi-step deductive reasoning ($n=600$). StrategyQA~\cite{geva2021strategyqa} evaluates commonsense reasoning ($n=200$ for LLaMA-3.1-8B; $n=60$ for other models). ARC-Challenge~\cite{clark2018arc} covers science questions ($n=60$). GSM8K~\cite{cobbe2021gsm8k} ($n=30$) and AIME 2024 ($n=22$) serve as operating-regime probes, both exhibiting near-ceiling SC accuracy or near-zero $C_0$.
12	
13	\paragraph{Parameters.} We sample $K=12$ traces per question at temperature $T=0.7$. Z3~\cite{demoura2008z3} solves each MAX-SAT instance with a 10-second timeout. Temperature ablation varies $T \in \{0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 1.0\}$.
14	
15	\paragraph{Metrics.} We report accuracy (\%), $C_0$ (\S\ref{sec:c0}), and $\Delta = \text{SICA} - \text{SC}$ in percentage points (pp). Statistical significance uses the McNemar test at $\alpha = 0.05$. For conditions with $n \geq 200$, we compute 95\% bootstrap confidence intervals with 10{,}000 resamples.
16	
17	
18	\subsection{Main Results: SICA Provides No Significant Gain}
19	\label{sec:main-results}

21	Table~\ref{tab:main_results} reports results across all model-domain conditions. Symbolic constraint aggregation does not improve over majority voting.

48	\end{table*}
49	
50	Across the four adequately powered conditions ($n \geq 200$, combined $N = 1{,}208$), $\Delta$ ranges from $-2.45$ to $+2.00$~pp, with no condition reaching significance ($p = 0.267$ and $0.424$ for the two nonzero gaps). The seven smaller conditions ($n \leq 60$) are consistent with this null pattern: $\Delta$ ranges from $-3.33$ to $+3.33$~pp, all nonsignificant. QwQ-32B on AIME produces identical outputs ($C_0 = 2.6\%$), confirming that reasoning-specialized models leave no room for SICA to operate.
51	
52	Across eleven conditions, six models, and more than 1,300 instances, SICA does not improve upon majority voting. The oracle row tells a different story: gold FOL constraints yield $+8.82$~pp over SC ($p < 0.001$), proving the aggregation mechanism works when given discriminative constraints.
53	
54	
55	\subsection{Oracle Control: The Aggregation Mechanism Is Effective}
56	\label{sec:oracle}
57	
58	We construct an oracle variant that replaces self-extracted constraints with gold FOL annotations from FOLIO ($n = 204$). Z3 evaluates ground-truth formulas against each candidate answer; all other pipeline components remain identical.
59	
60	Oracle-SICA achieves 88.24\% accuracy versus 79.41\% for both SC and standard SICA. The $+8.82$~pp gain is highly significant (McNemar $p = 6.15 \times 10^{-5}$). Z3 checks on gold annotations agree with ground-truth labels for 193/204 problems (94.6\%). This establishes that the MAX-SAT mechanism is sound given correct constraints, and that the bottleneck lies entirely in extraction quality.
61	
62	
63	\subsection{Capability Trap Diagnostics}
64	\label{sec:diagnostics}
65	
66	Why does SICA fail? Full per-condition metrics are in Appendix Table~\ref{tab:capability_trap}. $C_0$ ranges from 2.6\% (QwQ-32B) to 61.8\% (LLaMA-3.1-8B on FOLIO). For reasoning-specialized models, over 97\% of questions receive unanimous answers, so SICA reduces to SC by construction. For instruction-tuned models, higher $C_0$ creates opportunities for SICA to differ from SC, yet $\Delta$ remains nonsignificant everywhere (Figure~\ref{fig:diagnostics}b). Extraction rates exceed 0.80 and contradiction rates stay below 7\%, so the pipeline is mechanically functional. The problem is extraction vacuity: constraints are syntactically valid but semantically redundant with their source answers. Even the highest-quality condition (LLaMA-3.1-8B on FOLIO, extraction rate 0.94) yields $\Delta = -2.45$~pp. A temperature ablation ($T \in \{0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 1.0\}$, Qwen2.5-14B, $n{=}60$) shows $C_0$ increasing monotonically from 30.0\% ($T{=}0.3$) to 38.3\% ($T{=}0.5$), 40.0\% ($T{=}0.7$), and 43.3\% ($T{=}1.0$), yet $\Delta$ never exceeds zero: 0.0~pp at $T{=}0.3$, 0.0~pp at $T{=}0.5$, $-3.33$~pp at $T{=}0.7$ ($n{=}60$, n.s.), and 0.0~pp at $T{=}1.0$ (Figure~\ref{fig:diagnostics}a). Even at the default temperature $T{=}0.7$, SICA does not outperform SC.

87	
88	\subsection{Constraint Ablation: MAX-SAT Degenerates to Counting}
89	\label{sec:ablation}
90	
91	If self-extracted constraints are non-discriminative, MAX-SAT should produce the same predictions as baselines ignoring satisfiability. We test three variants on Qwen2.5-14B (FOLIO + ProofWriter, $n = 804$): full SICA, count-only (most constraints wins, ignoring satisfiability), and random-weight (randomized weights before solving).
92	
93	\begin{table}[t]
94	\centering
95	\small
96	\caption{Constraint ablation (Qwen2.5-14B, $n = 804$, FOLIO + ProofWriter). Agreement: predictions identical to SC out of 804.}
97	\label{tab:ablation}
98	\begin{tabular}{@{}lrc@{}}
99	\toprule
100	Aggregation & Acc.\ (\%) & Agreement w/ SC \\
101	\midrule
102	SC (majority vote) & 76.24 & --- \\
103	SICA (MAX-SAT) & 76.49 & 773\,/\,804 \\
104	Count-only & 76.62 & 774\,/\,804 \\
105	Random-weight & 75.87 & 764\,/\,804 \\
106	\bottomrule
107	\end{tabular}
108	\end{table}
109	
110	MAX-SAT and count-only agree on 803 of 804 predictions, confirming that the satisfiability solver contributes nothing beyond vote counting (Table~\ref{tab:ablation}). Against SC, all three variants disagree on 30--40 predictions (773--774 for SICA and count-only, 764 for random-weight), but wins and losses cancel: among SICA's 31 discordant pairs with SC, 16 favor SICA and 14 favor SC, yielding a net gain of only $+$2 problems. Random-weight deviates most from SC (764/804) and achieves the lowest accuracy (75.87\%), confirming that randomizing constraint weights introduces noise without discriminative benefit. Self-extracted constraints carry no signal beyond vote counts. The oracle control ($+8.82$~pp) confirms that the aggregation mechanism works given independent problem structure; self-extracted constraints simply fail to provide it.

The Qwen2.5-7B condition enables within-family scaling comparison.\n\n\\paragraph{Datasets.} FOLIO~\\cite{han2022folio} (validation split) provides formal logic problems with gold FOL annotations ($n=204$), enabling the oracle control (\\S\\ref{sec:oracle}). ProofWriter~\\cite{tafjord2021proofwriter} tests multi-step deductive reasoning ($n=600$). StrategyQA~\\cite{geva2021strategyqa} evaluates commonsense reasoning ($n=200$ for LLaMA-3.1-8B; $n=60$ for other models). ARC-Challenge~\\cite{clark2018arc} covers science questions ($n=60$). GSM8K~\\cite{cobbe2021gsm8k} ($n=30$) and AIME 2024 ($n=22$) serve as operating-regime probes, both exhibiting near-ceiling SC accuracy or near-zero $C_0$.\n\n\\paragraph{Parameters.} We sample $K=12$ traces per question at temperature $T=0.7$. Z3~\\cite{demoura2008z3} solves each MAX-SAT instance with a 10-second timeout. Temperature ablation varies $T \\in \\{0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 1.0\\}$.\n\n\\paragraph{Metrics.} We report accuracy (\\%), $C_0$ (\\S\\ref{sec:c0}), and $\\Delta = \\text{SICA} - \\text{SC}$ in percentage points (pp). Statistical significance uses the McNemar test at $\\alpha = 0.05$. For conditions with $n \\geq 200$, we compute 95\\% bootstrap confidence intervals with 10{,}000 resamples.\n\n\n\\subsection{Main Results: SICA Provides No Significant Gain}\n\\label{sec:main-results}\n\nTable~\\ref{tab:main_results} reports results across all model-domain conditions. Symbolic constraint aggregation does not improve over majority voting.\n\n\\begin{table*}[t]\n\\centering\n\\small\n\\caption{Accuracy of Self-Consistency (SC) and SICA across three primary domains and two supplementary probes. $\\Delta$ denotes the SICA$-$SC gap in percentage points.

The seven smaller conditions ($n \\leq 60$) are consistent with this null pattern: $\\Delta$ ranges from $-3.33$ to $+3.33$~pp, all nonsignificant. QwQ-32B on AIME produces identical outputs ($C_0 = 2.6\\%$), confirming that reasoning-specialized models leave no room for SICA to operate.\n\nAcross eleven conditions, six models, and more than 1,300 instances, SICA does not improve upon majority voting. The oracle row tells a different story: gold FOL constraints yield $+8.82$~pp over SC ($p < 0.001$), proving the aggregation mechanism works when given discriminative constraints.\n\n\n\\subsection{Oracle Control: The Aggregation Mechanism Is Effective}\n\\label{sec:oracle}\n\nWe construct an oracle variant that replaces self-extracted constraints with gold FOL annotations from FOLIO ($n = 204$). Z3 evaluates ground-truth formulas against each candidate answer; all other pipeline components remain identical.\n\nOracle-SICA achieves 88.24\\% accuracy versus 79.41\\% for both SC and standard SICA. The $+8.82$~pp gain is highly significant (McNemar $p = 6.15 \\times 10^{-5}$). Z3 checks on gold annotations agree with ground-truth labels for 193/204 problems (94.6\\%). This establishes that the MAX-SAT mechanism is sound given correct constraints, and that the bottleneck lies entirely in extraction quality.\n\n\n\\subsection{Capability Trap Diagnostics}\n\\label{sec:diagnostics}\n\nWhy does SICA fail? Full per-condition metrics are in Appendix Table~\\ref{tab:capability_trap}. $C_0$ ranges from 2.6\\% (QwQ-32B) to 61.8\\% (LLaMA-3.1-8B on FOLIO). For reasoning-specialized models, over 97\\% of questions receive unanimous answers, so SICA reduces to SC by construction. For instruction-tuned models, higher $C_0$ creates opportunities for SICA to differ from SC, yet $\\Delta$ remains nonsignificant everywhere (Figure~\\ref{fig:diagnostics}b). Extraction rates exceed 0.80 and contradiction rates stay below 7\\%, so the pipeline is mechanically functional. The problem is extraction vacuity: constraints are syntactically valid but semantically redundant with their source answers. Even the highest-quality condition (LLaMA-3.1-8B on FOLIO, extraction rate 0.94) yields $\\Delta = -2.45$~pp. A temperature ablation ($T \\in \\{0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 1.0\\}$, Qwen2.5-14B, $n{=}60$) shows $C_0$ increasing monotonically from 30.0\\% ($T{=}0.3$) to 38.3\\% ($T{=}0.5$), 40.0\\% ($T{=}0.7$), and 43.3\\% ($T{=}1.0$), yet $\\Delta$ never exceeds zero: 0.0~pp at $T{=}0.3$, 0.0~pp at $T{=}0.5$, $-3.33$~pp at $T{=}0.7$ ($n{=}60$, n.s.), and 0.0~pp at $T{=}1.0$ (Figure~\\ref{fig:diagnostics}a). Even at the default temperature $T{=}0.7$, SICA does not outperform SC.\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\\centering\n\\begin{subfigure}[b]{0.48\\columnwidth}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{fig2_capability_scatter.pdf}\n\\caption{Vote entropy vs.\\ constraint exclusion rate (Qwen2.5-14B, $n{=}307$ multi-candidate problems).}\n\\label{fig:capability_scatter}\n\\end{subfigure}\n\\hfill\n\\begin{subfigure}[b]{0.48\\columnwidth}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{fig3_operating_regime.pdf}\n\\caption{$C_0$ vs.\\ SICA$-$SC gap across all conditions.}\n\\label{fig:operating_regime}\n\\end{subfigure}\n\\caption{Capability trap diagnostics. (a) High vote entropy does not benefit from constraint filtering. (b) The accuracy gap stays centered at zero regardless of answer diversity.}\n\\label{fig:diagnostics}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\subsection{Constraint Ablation: MAX-SAT Degenerates to Counting}\n\\label{sec:ablation}\n\nIf self-extracted constraints are non-discriminative, MAX-SAT should produce the same predictions as baselines ignoring satisfiability. We test three variants on Qwen2.5-14B (FOLIO + ProofWriter, $n = 804$): full SICA, count-only (most constraints wins, ignoring satisfiability), and random-weight (randomized weights before solving).\n\n\\begin{table}[t]\n\\centering\n\\small\n\\caption{Constraint ablation (Qwen2.5-14B, $n = 804$, FOLIO + ProofWriter). Agreement: predictions identical to SC out of 804.}\n\\label{tab:ablation}\n\\begin{tabular}{@{}lrc@{}}\n\\toprule\nAggregation & Acc.\\ (\\%) & Agreement w/ SC \\\\\n\\midrule\nSC (majority vote) & 76.24 & --- \\\\\nSICA (MAX-SAT) & 76.49 & 773\\,/\\,804 \\\\\nCount-only & 76.62 & 774\\,/\\,804 \\\\\nRandom-weight & 75.87 & 764\\,/\\,804 \\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\n\nMAX-SAT and count-only agree on 803 of 804 predictions, confirming that the satisfiability solver contributes nothing beyond vote counting (Table~\\ref{tab:ablation}). Against SC, all three variants disagree on 30--40 predictions (773--774 for SICA and count-only, 764 for random-weight), but wins and losses cancel: among SICA's 31 discordant pairs with SC, 16 favor SICA and 14 favor SC, yielding a net gain of only $+$2 problems. Random-weight deviates most from SC (764/804) and achieves the lowest accuracy (75.87\\%), confirming that randomizing constraint weights introduces noise without discriminative benefit. Self-extracted constraints carry no signal beyond vote counts. The oracle control ($+8.82$~pp) confirms that the aggregation mechanism works given independent problem structure; self-extracted constraints simply fail to provide it.\n",

1	\section{Discussion}
2	\label{sec:discussion}
3	
4	The oracle experiment (Table~\ref{tab:main_results}, bottom) constitutes a causal intervention that isolates the source of failure. By replacing only the constraint source while holding all other pipeline components fixed, we establish that aggregation is not the bottleneck: the $+8.82$\,pp improvement ($p < 0.001$) pinpoints same-model self-extraction as the single point of failure. This oracle design follows established methodology where component-level interventions isolate error sources \citep{press2023compositionality, trivedi2023ircot, saparov2023greedy}.
5	
6	Manual analysis of constraint quality explains the mechanism. Across 43 pilot problems (23 with multiple candidates), only 11.5\% of unique constraints evaluated differently across candidates. The remainder encoded shared domain facts (predicate definitions, background implications, intermediate steps) satisfied equally by every candidate. In only 4 of 23 multi-answer problems (17.4\%) did discriminative constraints favor a non-majority answer, accounting for the 803/804 agreement between MAX-SAT and count-only (Table~\ref{tab:ablation}).
7	
8	The computational cost is substantial: constraint extraction accounts for 48.7\% of total SICA pipeline time, roughly doubling wall-clock cost compared to SC alone. SICA and SC disagree on 31 of 804 problems (3.9\%), but these disagreements approximately cancel: 16 SICA wins versus 14 SC wins, yielding a net gain of only $+$2 problems. Bootstrap confidence intervals bound the true effect to [$-1.12$, $+1.62$]\,pp for the largest confirmatory condition ($n = 804$; Appendix Table~\ref{tab:bootstrap}): even if a small effect exists, it cannot justify the pipeline's additional complexity and cost.
9	
10	The $+8.82$\,pp oracle ceiling quantifies the potential locked behind the capability trap. Three concrete paths can unlock it. First, trained FOL extractors supervised on datasets with gold annotations (such as FOLIO) can learn extraction patterns that exceed same-model capabilities; FoVer \citep{wang2025fover} demonstrates this approach with a dedicated verifier. Second, external provers that verify constraints independently of the reasoning model eliminate the circular dependency between generation and verification. Third, cross-model extraction, where a separate model extracts constraints from another model's traces, breaks the self-reference loop that produces non-discriminative constraints. Each path targets the extraction bottleneck directly; since MAX-SAT and count-only produce identical predictions on 803/804 instances, improving the aggregation mechanism offers no path forward.
11	
12	For practitioners considering constraint-based voting, $C_0$ provides a zero-cost screening criterion computable from the trace sampling stage alone, before any constraint extraction or solver invocation. When $C_0$ falls below 5\%, SICA degenerates to SC by construction. High $C_0$ is necessary but not sufficient, as the capability trap renders constraints non-discriminative even when disagreement is abundant ($C_0 = 61.8\%$, $\Delta = -2.45$~pp, n.s., for LLaMA-3.1-8B on FOLIO). The recommended workflow is: compute $C_0$, and if it exceeds 5\%, assess constraint quality on a small pilot before committing to full-scale extraction.

1	\section{Related Work}
2	\label{sec:related-work}
3	
4	\paragraph{Self-Consistency and Extensions.}
5	Self-Consistency (SC) selects the most frequent answer from multiple sampled chain-of-thought traces \citep{wang2023sc} and remains a strong baseline for multi-path reasoning. Universal Self-Consistency (USC) extends SC to free-form generation by having the LLM itself select the most consistent response \citep{chen2024usc}. Confidence-weighted variants assign trace-level confidence scores to improve vote quality \citep{taubenfeld2025cisc}, while DiVeRSe combines diverse prompting strategies with step-aware verification \citep{li2023diverse}. Recent work has identified scaling plateaus: increasing the number of sampled traces yields diminishing returns beyond a saturation point \citep{loo2025reevaluating}. These findings motivate the search for aggregation mechanisms that extract richer signal from reasoning traces than simple vote counting. SICA represents one such attempt: it replaces plurality voting with symbolic constraint satisfaction over self-extracted FOL formulas. Our negative results show that the bottleneck lies not in the aggregation mechanism but in the quality of self-extracted constraints, a failure mode that vote-based methods sidestep by not requiring formalization at all.
6	
7	\paragraph{Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning.}
8	A growing line of work combines LLMs with symbolic solvers to improve logical reasoning. Logic-LM translates natural language problems into symbolic formulations and delegates solving to an external prover \citep{pan2023logiclm}. LINC pairs language models with first-order logic provers in a modular architecture \citep{olausson2023linc}. More recent systems push this integration further: DyLoS adaptively selects among multiple solver paradigms \citep{xu2026dylos}, Aristotle decomposes problems through a logic-complete search framework \citep{li2025aristotle}, FoVer trains a dedicated verifier on FOL annotations \citep{wang2025fover}, and LogicAgent applies multi-perspective semiotic grounding \citep{luo2025logicagent}. A critical distinction separates these methods from SICA. All of the above rely on trained verifiers, external provers, or multi-paradigm solver selection, components that introduce knowledge beyond the reasoning model itself. SICA instead asks whether the same model that produced the reasoning traces can also extract useful formal constraints from them. Our oracle experiment confirms that sound FOL constraints do improve aggregation (+8.82\,pp); the failure is specific to same-model self-extraction, not to symbolic reasoning as an approach. The oracle-replacement design follows established methodology for isolating pipeline bottlenecks: \citet{press2023compositionality} use oracle sub-question answers to measure compositional gaps, \citet{trivedi2023ircot} replace retrieval with gold passages to separate retrieval from reasoning errors, and \citet{saparov2023greedy} provide gold premises to isolate proof search failures.
9	
10	\paragraph{Test-Time Compute and Reasoning Models.}
11	Scaling test-time computation has emerged as an alternative to parameter scaling. \citet{snell2025scaling} show that optimally allocated test-time compute can outperform larger models and establish a framework for analyzing the compute-accuracy tradeoff at inference. Reasoning-specialized models such as DeepSeek-R1 \citep{guo2025deepseekr1} internalize extended chain-of-thought through reinforcement learning and produce longer but more coherent traces. Diversity-aware training methods explicitly optimize for trace diversity during test-time scaling \citep{diverseaware2025}. These developments interact with our findings through the $C_0$ diagnostic. Reasoning models produce highly consistent outputs across samples: QwQ-32B achieves $C_0 = 2.6\%$ on our benchmarks, while DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B ($C_0 = 58.3\%$) behaves as an instruction-scale model rather than a reasoning model, likely because its 7B capacity cannot sustain the deterministic reasoning chains learned through distillation. When nearly all traces converge to the same answer, any aggregation method reduces to the unanimous output. The $C_0$ metric thus provides a zero-cost signal for practitioners to determine whether post-hoc aggregation can offer any benefit for a given model.
12	
13	\paragraph{Verification and Reranking.}
14	Trained verifiers offer an alternative path to improving multi-path reasoning. Outcome-level reward models (ORMs) score complete solutions and select the highest-ranked candidate \citep{cobbe2021gsm8k}. Process reward models (PRMs) assign step-level scores and enable finer-grained selection \citep{lightman2023prm}. Math-Shepherd automates process supervision annotation and removes the need for human labels \citep{wang2024mathshepherd}. V-STaR extends self-improvement by training verifiers on both correct and incorrect model-generated solutions \citep{hosseini2024vstar}. Reasoning-aware variants score individual reasoning paths rather than training separate verifiers: RASC assigns confidence scores based on textual quality indicators and consistency \citep{wan2024rasc}, while ReASC frames adaptive sampling as evidence sufficiency and aggregates response-level confidence \citep{kim2026reasc}. These approaches share SICA's goal of selecting better answers from a candidate pool but differ in that they either train a separate scoring model or use lightweight heuristics grounded in textual features rather than formal logic. SICA's constraint extraction requires no training data and no additional model; it relies entirely on the reasoning model's own ability to formalize its logic. Our results suggest that this self-reliance is precisely the problem. Without an external signal to ground constraint quality, self-extracted constraints encode the same biases present in the original traces and fail to provide corrective information.
15	
16	\paragraph{Constraint Satisfaction in NLP.}
17	Constraint-based formulations have gained traction for evaluating and improving LLM reasoning. SATBench benchmarks LLMs on Boolean satisfiability problems and reveals systematic weaknesses in logical structure handling \citep{satbench2025}. Work on integrating LLMs with constraint propagation has explored constrained text generation and hybrid solver architectures \citep{llmmeets_cp2025}. SICA's MAX-SAT formulation sits within this broader trend: it uses Z3 to find the maximum-weight satisfiable subset of self-extracted constraints. The key difference is that SICA's constraints originate from the model's own reasoning traces rather than from problem specifications or external knowledge bases. Our finding that these self-extracted constraints lack discriminative power complements the SATBench results: LLMs struggle both to solve formal constraints directly and to produce useful constraints from their own reasoning.
18	
19	\paragraph{Debate and Multi-Agent Aggregation.}
20	Multi-agent debate refines answers through iterative natural language discussion among LLM instances \citep{liang2023encouraging,du2023improving}. In debate, models exchange arguments in plain text and update their positions based on peer responses. SICA takes a structurally different approach: instead of natural language refinement, it extracts formal constraints and resolves disagreements through satisfiability optimization. Both families attempt to move beyond simple voting, but debate preserves natural language flexibility while SICA commits to formal structure. \citet{huang2024selfcorrect} show that LLMs struggle to self-correct reasoning without external feedback, and \citet{mirzadeh2024gsmsymbolic} demonstrate that LLM mathematical reasoning is fragile under symbolic perturbations. Both findings parallel our capability trap: the same model that produced flawed reasoning cannot reliably formalize the correction. Across all six lines of work reviewed here, the consistent pattern is that improving on majority voting requires information beyond what the reasoning model can extract from its own outputs, whether from trained verifiers, external solvers, human annotations, or cross-model interaction.

2	
3	We evaluated Symbolic Invariant Consensus Aggregation across six models from five model families (7B to 32B parameters) and three reasoning domains with more than 1,300 total instances. Self-extracted SICA provides no statistically significant improvement over Self-Consistency in any tested condition, with accuracy gaps ranging from $-3.3$ to $+3.3$\,pp. The oracle experiment, which replaces self-extraction with gold FOL annotations verified by Z3, achieves $+8.82$ percentage points over SC ($p < 0.001$). This result causally localizes the failure to extraction quality: the MAX-SAT aggregation mechanism is sound when supplied with high-quality constraints, but same-model self-extraction cannot produce them. We characterize this as a \emph{capability trap}: because the reasoning model also extracts the constraints, those constraints inherit the same biases that produced potentially flawed answers and carry no independent discriminative signal. The failure is not one of aggregation design but of the circular dependency between generation and verification within a single model.
4	
5	The practical consequences are substantial. Only 11.5\% of self-extracted constraints evaluate differently across candidate answers; the remainder encode shared domain facts satisfied equally by every candidate. MAX-SAT agrees with count-only aggregation on 803 of 804 predictions, which confirms that satisfiability structure adds nothing when constraints are non-discriminative. Constraint extraction accounts for 48.7\% of total pipeline time and roughly doubles computational cost for zero expected accuracy benefit. For practitioners who evaluate constraint-based voting, the multi-candidate rate $C_0$ serves as a zero-cost diagnostic: it is computable from trace samples alone, before any investment in constraint extraction or solver invocation. Low $C_0$ rules out any possible SICA gain by construction, and high $C_0$ signals the need for a small-scale constraint quality audit before full deployment.
6	
7	The $+8.82$\,pp oracle gap quantifies recoverable potential; trained extractors, cross-model pipelines, and external provers each target the extraction bottleneck directly, as discussed in \S\ref{sec:discussion}.

First, the oracle experiment is restricted to FOLIO ($n = 204$), the only benchmark in our study with gold FOL annotations; extending this analysis to other domains requires constructing comparable gold constraint sets. Second, seven of our eleven model-domain conditions have $n \leq 60$, providing insufficient statistical power for confirmatory claims; power analysis shows that the minimum detectable effect exceeds 5\,pp for these conditions (Appendix Table~\ref{tab:power}), so they serve as regime characterization rather than definitive tests. Third, we do not compare against trained FOL extractors or cross-model extraction pipelines; our findings characterize the limitations of same-model self-extraction specifically. Fourth, all models tested range from 7B to 32B parameters; whether the capability trap persists at larger scales (70B+) remains an open question. Fifth, our extraction prompts use a single zero-shot template per domain; alternative prompting strategies (few-shot exemplars, chain-of-thought extraction, or iterative refinement) might yield higher-quality constraints, though the oracle gap suggests the bottleneck is fundamental rather than prompt-specific. Sixth, the manual constraint quality analysis (11.5\% discriminative rate, 17.4\% flip rate) covers only Qwen2.5-14B on FOLIO and ProofWriter; other model-domain combinations may exhibit different constraint characteristics. Seventh, the GSM8K pilot ($n = 30$) is included to illustrate the constraint-absent failure regime and should not be interpreted as confirmatory evidence.

2	\section{Prompt Templates}
3	\label{app:prompts}
4	
5	SICA uses domain-specific prompt templates for constraint extraction: one for mathematical reasoning (GSM8K, AIME) and one for logical reasoning (ProofWriter, FOLIO). Both share the same system prompt. The LLM is called with temperature $T{=}0.1$, max tokens $1024$, and structured JSON output mode. Up to 6 traces are processed in parallel via thread pooling, with 2 retries on failure (exponential backoff, base 0.5s).
6	
7	\paragraph{System Prompt.}
8	
9	\begin{lstlisting}
10	You are a constraint extraction tool. Output ONLY
11	valid JSON. Do NOT solve problems, reason about
12	correctness, or think step-by-step. Extract
13	constraints from the given trace exactly as stated.
14	\end{lstlisting}
15	
16	\paragraph{Mathematical Constraint Extraction (EXTRACTION\_PROMPT).}
17	
18	Used for GSM8K and AIME datasets. The placeholder \texttt{\{trace\}} is replaced with the reasoning trace at runtime.
19	
20	\begin{lstlisting}
21	Extract mathematical constraints from this reasoning
22	trace as a JSON object.
23	
24	Rules:
25	- type: "equation", "inequality", or "predicate"
26	- expression: human-readable, e.g. "x + y == 14"
27	- z3_formula: a single comparison expression in
28	  Python Z3 syntax
29	- source_step: step number where the constraint
30	  appears
31	- Use variable names from the trace
32	
33	z3_formula MUST follow these rules:
34	- Allowed operators: ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=, +, -, *,
35	  /, **, %
36	- Use individual named variables: a1, a2, a3...
37	  NOT arrays a[1] or sets A
38	- Expand all sums explicitly:
39	  "a1 + a2 + a3 == 55" NOT "sum([a1,a2,a3])"
40	- NO Python builtins: sum(), len(), max(), min(),
41	  list(), set(), range(), int()
42	- Each z3_formula must be exactly ONE comparison
43	  (==, !=, <, >, <=, >=)
44	- For multiple values, write separate constraints
45	  for each
46	
47	Output ONLY the JSON below, nothing else:
48	{"constraints": [{"type": "equation",
49	  "expression": "x + y == 14",
50	  "z3_formula": "x + y == 14",
51	  "source_step": 1}],
52	 "answer": "final_answer",
53	 "variables": ["x", "y"]}
54	
55	Trace:
56	{trace}
57	\end{lstlisting}
58	
59	\paragraph{Logical Constraint Extraction (LOGIC\_EXTRACTION\_PROMPT).}
60	
61	Used for ProofWriter and FOLIO datasets.
62	
63	\begin{lstlisting}
64	IMPORTANT: You are an EXTRACTION tool, NOT a problem
65	solver.
66	- Do NOT re-solve or re-reason about the problem.
67	- Do NOT verify whether the trace's reasoning is
68	  correct.
69	- ONLY extract the logical constraints that are
70	  explicitly stated or used in the trace below.
71	- Output ONLY the JSON object, nothing else.
72	
73	Extract logical constraints from this reasoning trace
74	about a logic problem.
75	
76	The problem has facts (base assertions), rules
77	(grounded implications), and derived conclusions.
78	Convert each into a Z3 boolean formula.
79	
80	Variable naming:
81	- Unary property: property_entity
82	  (e.g., kind_anne, red_charlie, round_fiona)
83	- Binary relation: relation_subject_object
84	  (e.g., eats_bear_squirrel, likes_lion_cat)
85	- Use lowercase with underscores only
86	
87	Constraint types:
88	- "fact": a given assertion,
89	  e.g., kind_anne == True
90	- "rule": a grounded implication over specific
91	  entities, e.g., Implies(kind_anne, nice_anne)
92	- "derived": an inferred conclusion from facts +
93	  rules, e.g., nice_anne == True
94	
95	Z3 operators:
96	- Implies(a, b) for if-then rules
97	- And(a, b, ...) for conjunctive conditions
98	- Or(a, b, ...) for disjunctive conditions
99	- Not(a) for negation
100	- == True / == False for boolean assertions
101	
102	Output ONLY the JSON below, nothing else:
103	{"constraints": [{"type": "fact",
104	  "expression": "kind(anne)",
105	  "z3_formula": "kind_anne == True",
106	  "source_step": 1}],
107	 "answer": "True or False or Unknown",
108	 "variables": ["kind_anne"]}
109	
110	Trace:
111	{trace}
112	\end{lstlisting}
113	
114	\paragraph{Output Schema.}
115	
116	Both prompts produce a JSON object with the following structure:
117	
118	\begin{lstlisting}
119	{
120	  "constraints": [
121	    {
122	      "type": "&lt;equation|inequality|predicate>
123	               or &lt;fact|rule|derived>",
124	      "expression": "&lt;human-readable description>",
125	      "z3_formula": "&lt;Z3-compatible expression>",
126	      "source_step": &lt;integer>
127	    }
128	  ],
129	  "answer": "&lt;final answer string>",
130	  "variables": ["&lt;var1>", "&lt;var2>", "..."]
131	}
132	\end{lstlisting}
133	
134	The pipeline additionally injects an \texttt{answer\_assertion} constraint per trace (not produced by the LLM):
135	
136	\begin{lstlisting}
137	{"type": "answer_assertion",
138	 "expression": "answer is &lt;ans>",
139	 "z3_formula": "__sica_answer_&lt;ans> == True",
140	 "source_step": -1}
141	\end{lstlisting}
142	
143	\paragraph{Prompt Selection Logic.}
144	
145	Domain assignment is determined by dataset: FOLIO and ProofWriter use \textsc{Logic\_Extraction\_Prompt}; GSM8K and AIME use \textsc{Extraction\_Prompt}.
146	
147	
148	\section{Capability Trap Diagnostics}
149	\label{app:diagnostics}
150	
151	Table~\ref{tab:capability_trap} reports per-condition diagnostic metrics referenced in \S\ref{sec:diagnostics}.
152	
153	\begin{table}[h]
154	\centering
155	\small
156	\begin{tabular}{@{}llrrrr@{}}
157	\toprule
158	Model & Domain & $C_0$ (\%) & Extr.\ Rate & Contr.\ Rate & $\Delta$ (pp) \\
159	\midrule
160	Qwen2.5-14B & FOLIO & 35.3 & 0.89 & 0.022 & 0.00 \\
161	Qwen2.5-14B & ProofWriter & 39.2 & 0.89 & 0.022 & $+$0.33 \\

163	Qwen2.5-14B & ARC-Chall.$^\dagger$ & 5.0 & 1.00 & --- & $-$1.67 \\
164	Qwen2.5-7B & FOLIO+PW$^\dagger$ & 42.1 & 0.94 & 0.027 & 0.00 \\

166	LLaMA-3.1-8B & StrategyQA & 41.0 & --- & --- & $+$2.00 \\
167	LLaMA-3.1-8B & FOLIO & 61.8 & 0.94 & 0.062 & $-$2.45 \\

171	\bottomrule
172	\end{tabular}
173	\caption{Capability trap diagnostics. $C_0$: fraction of questions with multiple distinct candidate answers across $K=12$ traces. Extraction rate: fraction of traces yielding at least one parseable FOL constraint. Contradiction rate: fraction of extracted constraint sets with internal contradictions. $\Delta$: SICA$-$SC gap (pp). $\dagger$: $n \leq 60$.}
174	\label{tab:capability_trap}
175	\end{table}
176	
177	
178	\section{Statistical Power Analysis}
179	\label{app:power}
180	
181	We compute the minimum detectable effect (MDE) for each condition at $\alpha = 0.05$ and 80\% power using exact binomial power calculations over McNemar discordant pairs. Table~\ref{tab:power} reports the three conditions with $n \geq 200$, which constitute our confirmatory analyses. The remaining six conditions ($n \leq 60$) yield infinite MDE due to insufficient discordant pairs and serve only as regime characterization.
182	
183	\begin{table}[h]
184	\centering
185	\small
186	\begin{tabular}{lrrrrr}
187	\toprule
188	\textbf{Condition} & $n$ & \textbf{MDE} & \textbf{Obs.\ $\Delta$} & \textbf{Obs.\ Pow.} \\
189	\midrule
190	Qwen-14B FOLIO+PW   & 804 & 1.86pp & $+$0.25pp & 5.7\%  \\
191	LLaMA-8B StrategyQA  & 200 & 4.64pp & $+$2.00pp & 20.6\% \\
192	LLaMA-8B FOLIO       & 204 & 4.84pp & $-$2.45pp & 18.6\% \\
193	\bottomrule
194	\end{tabular}
195	\caption{Power analysis for confirmatory conditions ($n \geq 200$). MDE = minimum detectable effect at 80\% power. All observed effects fall below their respective MDEs, and observed power remains below 21\% in every case.}
196	\label{tab:power}
197	\end{table}
198	
199	The largest study (Qwen-14B, $n{=}804$, 30 discordant pairs) can detect effects as small as 1.86pp, yet the observed $\Delta$ of $+$0.25pp is an order of magnitude smaller. The two LLaMA-8B conditions require effects of 4.64pp and 4.84pp to reach significance; neither observed $\Delta$ approaches these thresholds. All three conditions are consistent with the null hypothesis that SICA provides no accuracy gain over self-consistency.
200	
201	
202	\section{Bootstrap Confidence Intervals}
203	\label{app:bootstrap}
204	
205	We compute 95\% confidence intervals for $\Delta(\text{SICA} - \text{SC})$ via 10{,}000 bootstrap resamples (percentile method, seed 42). Table~\ref{tab:bootstrap} reports the results for the three confirmatory conditions.
206	
207	\begin{table}[h]
208	\centering
209	\small
210	\begin{tabular}{lrrl}
211	\toprule
212	\textbf{Condition} & $n$ & \textbf{Obs.\ $\Delta$} & \textbf{95\% CI} \\
213	\midrule
214	Qwen-14B FOLIO+PW   & 804 & $+$0.25pp & [$-$1.12, $+$1.62] \\
215	LLaMA-8B StrategyQA  & 200 & $+$2.00pp & [$-$1.50, $+$5.50] \\
216	LLaMA-8B FOLIO       & 204 & $-$2.45pp & [$-$5.88, $+$0.98] \\
217	\bottomrule
218	\end{tabular}
219	\caption{Bootstrap 95\% confidence intervals for $\Delta(\text{SICA} - \text{SC})$ in percentage points. All intervals include zero, consistent with no reliable accuracy difference.}
220	\label{tab:bootstrap}
221	\end{table}
222	
223	All three intervals contain zero. The narrowest interval (Qwen-14B, [$-$1.12, $+$1.62]) rules out practically meaningful gains ($>$2pp) even in the most favorable case. The widest interval (LLaMA-8B FOLIO, [$-$5.88, $+$0.98]) skews negative, indicating that SICA may slightly hurt accuracy in this condition. These results corroborate the McNemar tests and power analysis: no condition provides evidence that symbolic constraint aggregation improves over majority voting.

Table~\\ref{tab:power} reports the three conditions with $n \\geq 200$, which constitute our confirmatory analyses. The remaining six conditions ($n \\leq 60$) yield infinite MDE due to insufficient discordant pairs and serve only as regime characterization.\n\n\\begin{table}[h]\n\\centering\n\\small\n\\begin{tabular}{lrrrrr}\n\\toprule\n\\textbf{Condition} & $n$ & \\textbf{MDE} & \\textbf{Obs.\\ $\\Delta$} & \\textbf{Obs.\\ Pow.} \\\\\n\\midrule\nQwen-14B FOLIO+PW   & 804 & 1.86pp & $+$0.25pp & 5.7\\%  \\\\\nLLaMA-8B StrategyQA  & 200 & 4.64pp & $+$2.00pp & 20.6\\% \\\\\nLLaMA-8B FOLIO       & 204 & 4.84pp & $-$2.45pp & 18.6\\% \\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}\n\\caption{Power analysis for confirmatory conditions ($n \\geq 200$). MDE = minimum detectable effect at 80\\% power. All observed effects fall below their respective MDEs, and observed power remains below 21\\% in every case.}\n\\label{tab:power}\n\\end{table}\n\nThe largest study (Qwen-14B, $n{=}804$, 30 discordant pairs) can detect effects as small as 1.86pp, yet the observed $\\Delta$ of $+$0.25pp is an order of magnitude smaller. The two LLaMA-8B conditions require effects of 4.64pp and 4.84pp to reach significance; neither observed $\\Delta$ approaches these thresholds. All three conditions are consistent with the null hypothesis that SICA provides no accuracy gain over self-consistency.\n\n\n\\section{Bootstrap Confidence Intervals}\n\\label{app:bootstrap}\n\nWe compute 95\\% confidence intervals for $\\Delta(\\text{SICA} - \\text{SC})$ via 10{,}000 bootstrap resamples (percentile method, seed 42). Table~\\ref{tab:bootstrap} reports the results for the three confirmatory conditions.\n\n\\begin{table}[h]\n\\centering\n\\small\n\\begin{tabular}{lrrl}\n\\toprule\n\\textbf{Condition} & $n$ & \\textbf{Obs.\\ $\\Delta$} & \\textbf{95\\% CI} \\\\\n\\midrule\nQwen-14B FOLIO+PW   & 804 & $+$0.25pp & [$-$1.12, $+$1.62] \\\\\nLLaMA-8B StrategyQA  & 200 & $+$2.00pp & [$-$1.50, $+$5.50] \\\\\nLLaMA-8B FOLIO       & 204 & $-$2.45pp & [$-$5.88, $+$0.98] \\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}\n\\caption{Bootstrap 95\\% confidence intervals for $\\Delta(\\text{SICA} - \\text{SC})$ in percentage points. All intervals include zero, consistent with no reliable accuracy difference.}\n\\label{tab:bootstrap}\n\\end{table}\n\nAll three intervals contain zero. The narrowest interval (Qwen-14B, [$-$1.12, $+$1.62]) rules out practically meaningful gains ($>$2pp) even in the most favorable case. The widest interval (LLaMA-8B FOLIO, [$-$5.88, $+$0.98]) skews negative, indicating that SICA may slightly hurt accuracy in this condition. These results corroborate the McNemar tests and power analysis: no condition provides evidence that symbolic constraint aggregation improves over majority voting.\n",

Now let me check for figure PDF files referenced in the tex:
- fig2_capability_scatter.pdf
- fig3_operating_regime.pdf

The graphicspath is set to `../figures/paper/` and `figures/`. Let me check both locations.

Also I need to check if there's a `\bibliographystyle` command in main.tex - I don't see one. The ACL template should handle this via `\usepackage[review]{acl}` which might set it automatically.

Let me also check for any em-dashes and other AI style markers, and check for undefined/unused citations.

Let me do these checks now.

Let me check the `-ing,` matches more carefully for AI-style patterns, and check for remaining issues. Let me look at the specific `-ing,` patterns to see which ones are actually problematic AI-style -ing phrase endings.

Looking at the grep results for `ing,`:
- related_work.tex:20 - omitted long line
- main.tex:17 - just tikzlibrary, not relevant
- conclusion.tex:5 - omitted long line
- discussion.tex:12 - omitted long line


- method.tex:73 - omitted long line
- appendix.tex:5 - "thread pooling, with 2 retries" - this is fine, pooling is a noun
- introduction.tex:15 - "majority voting, and only" - this is fine, voting is a noun

Now I need to read through the actual content of those omitted lines to see which ones contain problematic AI-style `-ing,` patterns. Let me check the related_work.tex line 20 first since that's where the debate paragraph is.

Looking at the citation keys in that debate paragraph - "encouraging" and "improving" are just part of the citation references, not actual AI-style gerunds, so those pass.

Moving to conclusion.tex line 5, I'm seeing a detailed analysis of constraint extraction results. The text discusses how only a small percentage of constraints actually differ across answers, MAX-SAT performance metrics, and the computational cost breakdown. The key insight is that constraint extraction doubles the pipeline time without providing accuracy benefits, and the multi-candidate rate serves as a useful diagnostic before investing in extraction or solving.

In discussion.tex line 12, I'm checking "considering" and "sampling" - both are natural English usage here, not the problematic AI-style patterns I'm looking for, so that passes too.

But method.tex line 73 has a clear issue: "making SICA a strict generalization of SC" is exactly the kind of trailing participial clause that signals AI writing, so I'm flagging that one.

Now I need to systematically go through each file and compile the full proofread results, starting with abstract.tex and working through the rest. I'm noticing a discrepancy in the numbers—if there are 31 discordant pairs between SICA and SC, but only 16 wins and 14 losses are accounted for, that leaves one pair unaccounted for. Let me verify this against Table 3, which shows 773/804 agreement, confirming 31 disagreements. The math suggests there might be a tie or I'm misunderstanding how the McNemar pairs are being counted. The first contribution claim seems to bundle two separate findings—that self-extracted SICA shows no significant improvement over majority voting, and that only a small fraction of constraints differ across candidates—which might be better separated. Moving to the method section, I notice "making SICA a strict generalization" uses an awkward -ing construction that could be rephrased more directly. The notation for the answer assertion constraint also looks inconsistent with how the subscript is formatted in the monospace text.

Now I'm checking the experimental setup against Table 1 to verify the reported numbers. The seven smaller conditions match what's listed, and I'm counting through the full set of conditions and models to confirm the claim about eleven conditions across six models and over 1,300 instances. I'm realizing some of these conditions might be overlapping or counted differently—the four adequately powered conditions total 1,208, but when I add up all the individual rows from the table, I get 1,556. Let me carefully recount the specific conditions listed to understand where the discrepancy comes from. The temperature ablation experiment used a different subset (n=60 from FOLIO) than the main results, so the -3.33 pp difference at T=0.7 isn't inconsistent with the main table showing Δ=0.00 for the full n=204 sample—just different experimental conditions. Now I'm moving into the discussion section to check the claims there. ative constraints favor a non-majority answer" - 4/23 = 17.39%, OK.
2. Line 8: "16 SICA wins versus 14 SC wins, yielding a net gain of only $+$2 problems" - consistent with introduction.

### related_work.tex
1. Line 8: "The oracle-replacement design follows established methodology for isolating pipeline bottlenecks:" - This sentence is in Related Work but seems more like it belongs in Method or Experiments. Not a grammar issue, but a structural note.
2. Line 11: "likely because its 7B capacity cannot sustain the deterministic reasoning chains learned through distillation" - Speculative claim without citation. Should be flagged as it's a strong interpretive claim.
3. Line 17: The description of the cited paper on LLMs and constraint propagation seems misaligned with what the paper actually covers. The current phrasing mentions "constrained text generation and hybrid solver architectures," but the original paper focuses on how LLMs generate candidate assignments while CP solvers enforce constraints. There's a mismatch between the description and the actual paper content that needs clarification.

### conclusion.tex
1. No major issues. Cross-references to §Discussion exist.
2. "six models from five model families" - consistent with abstract/intro.

### limitations_content.tex
1. Line 1

: "Seven of our eleven model-domain conditions have $n \leq 60$" - I'm verifying this against Table 1, and the count checks out: StrategyQA, ARC, Qwen7B, Mistral, DeepSeek, QwQ, and GSM8K all fall below or at the 60 threshold.
2. Line 1: "power analysis shows that the minimum detectable effect exceeds 5\,pp for these conditions" - But the power table indicates these conditions yield infinite MDE due to insufficient discordant pairs, not "exceeds 5pp." The phrasing is misleading since the power table only reports conditions with n≥200. This should be reworded to clarify that MDE is undefined for the smaller sample sizes.

Now I'm noticing a discrepancy in the power analysis itself. The text mentions "three conditions with $n \geq 200$" and "six conditions ($n \leq 60$)", which adds to 9 total, but we have 11 conditions. It seems like two conditions are unaccounted for in the power analysis breakdown, possibly because the analysis was conducted before GSM8K was included or the categorization differs from what's in Table 1. those are Qwen-14B FOLIO+PW (804), LLaMA-8B StrategyQA (200), LLaMA-8B FOLIO (204). Wait, Qwen-14B FOLIO+PW is a combined condition (FOLIO 204 + ProofWriter 600 = 804), which is actually two separate rows in Table 1. So the power analysis treats FOLIO+PW as one combined condition.

This is a counting inconsistency:
- Table 1: 11 rows
- Power analysis: "three conditions with n≥200" + "remaining six conditions (n≤60)" = 9
- Missing: Qwen2.5-14B FOLIO (n=204) and Qwen2.5-14B ProofWriter (n=600) are separate in Table 1 but combined as "Qwen-14B FOLIO+PW (n=804)" in the power analysis

The power analysis combined them for more statistical power, which is potentially confusing but not necessarily wrong. Now checking the limitations claim about seven conditions with n≤60 against Table 1: Qwen2.5-14B StrategyQA, Qwen2.5-14B ARC, Qwen2.5-7B FOLIO+PW, Mistral-7B FOLIO+PW, and DeepSeek-R1-7B FOLIO+PW all have n=60, while QwQ-32B AIME has n=22.

So there's a discrepancy: the power analysis says "six conditions (n≤60)" but the limitations section says "seven of our eleven model-domain conditions have n≤60", and the Experiments section also says "seven smaller conditions (n≤60)". The power analysis was likely written before the final count or excluded the oracle condition, creating an inconsistency between the appendix and the main text.

Now checking the appendix structure—all four sections are present with content: Prompt Templates, Capability Trap Diagnostics, Statistical Power Analysis, and Bootstrap Confidence Intervals. The cross-references are checking out so far, with figures from method.tex and experiments.tex properly linked. scatter}` and `\ref{fig:operating_regime}` → defined in experiments.tex ✓
- `\ref{tab:main_results}` → defined in experiments.tex ✓
- `\ref{tab:capability_trap}` → defined in appendix.tex ✓
- `\ref{tab:ablation}` → defined in experiments.tex ✓
- `\ref{tab:power}` → defined in appendix.tex ✓

- `\ref{sec:c0}` → defined in method.tex ✓
- `\ref{eq:degenerate}` → defined in method.tex ✓
- `\ref{app:prompts}` → defined in appendix.tex ✓

Now I'm checking the bibliography setup and citations. The ACL template should handle the bibliography style automatically, and I need to verify that all the citation keys in the tex files match entries in the references file. I've verified all the citations in the scaling section and confirmed that all 38 total citations have matching bibliography entries with no unused entries remaining.

Continuing through the rest of the bibliography entries... I've verified all the citations are present in the bibliography. Now I'm checking whether the `\bibliographystyle` command is needed—the ACL template should handle this automatically with natbib, though some versions might require an explicit style declaration. I'm also noticing a couple of issues: AIME 2024 in the experiments section lacks a citation despite being mentioned with sample counts, and I should verify whether Qwen2.5-7B is properly cited in the introduction.

Looking at the model count, I'm confirming the six models listed and checking how they map to five families—DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B is technically a DeepSeek model even though it's distilled from Qwen architecture, so it counts as a separate family. Wait, I need to recount this more carefully. QwQ-32B is from Qwen, so that's actually just four distinct families: Qwen, Mistral, LLaMA, and DeepSeek. But the paper explicitly states five families, so either I'm miscounting or there's something about how they're categorizing the DeepSeek model that makes it count separately.

Looking at the breakdown: Qwen has three models (Qwen2.5-14B, Qwen2.5-7B, and QwQ-32B), Mistral has one, LLaMA has one, and DeepSeek has one. The paper might be treating QwQ as its own family since it's reasoning-specialized rather than instruction-tuned, which would be a reasonable distinction even though it's technically from Qwen. That's worth flagging as a potential reviewer concern, but it's defensible given the different model purposes.

Now I'm noticing another issue with the StrategyQA sample sizes—the experiments section mentions different values for different models.

Good. The only remaining warnings are hyperref warnings about tokens in PDF strings (from the math in section titles like "The $C_0$ Diagnostic"), which is cosmetic and normal. No undefined citations, no undefined references, no multiply-defined labels.

Let me also check the page count for 8pp compliance.

Let me check which content those overfull hboxes correspond to. 

The overfull hbox at lines 44-45 is likely in the method.tex (TikZ figure caption or the figure itself).

The ones at 156-173, 186-195, 210-219 are in the appendix (tables overflowing).

Let me also check: 12 pages total. The main content should be 8pp, then references, then appendix. Let me verify by looking at the PDF.

Actually, let me count where each section starts. The main body includes:
- Abstract, Introduction, Related Work, Method, Experiments, Discussion, Conclusion, Limitations = main content


- References
- Appendix A-D

For EMNLP, I need to verify the page boundaries since the format allows 8 pages for main content with unlimited references and appendix. Let me map out which pages contain what.

Format: JSON with schema: {result: string}
- For targeted queries (find a value, filter by field): use jq on the file directly.
- For analysis or summarization that requires reading the full content: first probe the structure (e.g., jq 'type, length, keys?' /home/ubuntu/.claude-account-3/projects/-home-ubuntu--agent-ml-research-idea-gen-0513-3-projects-symb-invariant-consensus--claude-sessions-agent-47e5a40d/f2e14b4e-afcd-4be8-b19d-82d2efd6e746/tool-results/mcp-agent-ml-research-pdf_to_images-1779052284688.txt), then extract slices with jq or python — Read's line-based offset/limit will not chunk this file.
- If the Agent tool is available, do this inside a subagent so the full output stays out of your main context. Give it the instruction above verbatim, and be explicit about what it must return — e.g. "/home/ubuntu/.claude-account-3/projects/-home-ubuntu--agent-ml-research-idea-gen-0513-3-projects-symb-invariant-consensus--claude-sessions-agent-47e5a40d/f2e14b4e-afcd-4be8-b19d-82d2efd6e746/tool-results/mcp-agent-ml-research-pdf_to_images-1779052284688.txt is JSON with schema: {result: string}; probe the structure with jq (type/length/keys), then extract and read the content in full with jq or python, then summarize and quote any key findings verbatim."
