This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The summary below covers the earlier portion of the conversation.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   This session handles multiple sequential Director instructions for the symb_invariant_consensus EMNLP 2026 paper (DDL May 25):

   **Completed: BH Table Compilation Fix** — Resolved "Counter too large" LaTeX error from prior session by cleaning corrupted .aux files. BH correction table (12 conditions, 4 generators × 3 weights) confirmed rendering as Table 20 in appendix.

   **In Progress: R9 审稿修复** — 13-item comprehensive patch batch targeting Overall 3.0→3.5. All 13 content patches applied, but page fitting still in progress (~3 lines overflow on page 9).

   **URGENT/CRITICAL (newest, highest priority): Abstract/Intro mixed w value fix** — Reviewer identified selective reporting: Abstract and Intro Contribution #1 mix w=3 and w=5 peak results. "both p<0.004" is false at any single w. Must fix to w=3 primary values only.

   **HARD CONSTRAINTS**: EMNLP 8-page main text; w=3 is primary; DeBERTa standalone = 55.00%; SC baseline = 55.88%; Abstract/Intro locked peak results must use w=3 consistently.

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - EMNLP 2026 ARR: 8-page main text, unlimited references/appendix/limitations
   - Symbolic Mirage hypothesis: self-extracted constraints inherit model bias
   - Symbolic Confirmation Bias (BR=4.97×, 83.3% wrong-answer support)
   - Capability Gap Hypothesis: cross-architecture verification gain decreases monotonically with gap
   - Spearman ρ=0.970 (p<0.001) replacing sigmoid framing for capability gap
   - Adjusted R² comparison: sigmoid 0.781 vs linear 0.752 (Δ=0.029)
   - Effective-K as ordinal diagnostic, not literal sample size
   - K_eff caveat: Fleiss' κ ≠ ICC (ρ), validated via mean pairwise r=0.625
   - SatLM distinction: problem-level SAT vs trace-level self-extraction
   - Z3 semantic deduplication: ~10% additional removal, p=0.013
   - w=3 as primary analysis parameter; w=5 supplementary only
   - Benjamini-Hochberg correction (m=12, α=0.05)
   - LaTeX appendix A-Z limit (26 sections max)

3. Files and Code Sections:

   - **abstract.tex** — NEEDS CRITICAL FIX
     - Current problematic line 8: `Cross-architecture NLI verification yields significant gains on two of four generators from distinct model families (Mistral-7B $+10.67$\,pp, LLaMA-3.1-8B $+4.17$\,pp, both $p{<}0.004$), with gain magnitude predicted by the verifier--generator capability gap.`
     - Must change: Mistral +10.67pp → +3.50pp (w=3), remove "both p<0.004", add individual p values

   - **introduction.tex** — NEEDS CRITICAL FIX + page fitting
     - Contribution #1 (Independence-Accuracy Trade-off, now item 2 after reorder) currently says: `A cross-architecture NLI verifier yields significant gains on two of four generators across model families ($+10.67$\,pp Mistral-7B, $+4.17$\,pp LLaMA-3.1-8B; both $p < 0.004$), suggesting the ceiling is escapable`
     - Must change to w=3 values: +3.50pp Mistral (p=0.013), +4.17pp LLaMA (p=0.004)
     - Line 29 already correctly discloses both w values: `DeBERTa NLI yields $+3.50$\,pp on ProofWriter ($p = 0.013$; $+10.67$\,pp at $w{=}5$, $p < 0.001$)` — verify only
     - R9 changes: contribution reorder (SCB first), Z3 non-triviality argument, compressed oracle paragraph, figure moved here from method.tex (single-column)
     - Figure 1 (SICA pipeline) placed as `\begin{figure}[t]` with `\resizebox{\columnwidth}{!}` at end of §1

   - **related_work.tex** — R9 changes applied
     - Added SatLM comparison in neuro-symbolic paragraph (compressed)
     - Added VeriCoT + CRITIC citations in test-time compute paragraph (compressed)
     - Merged CJT paragraph into "CJT and positioning" (shortened)
     - Compressed positioning paragraph (removed sigmoid, kept Spearman)
     - Compressed neuro-symbolic paragraph citations list

   - **method.tex** — R9 changes applied
     - B1: κ→K_eff caveat expanded with ordinal diagnostic language and r=0.625
     - Figure 1 removed (moved to introduction.tex)
     - Current K_eff text: `$K_{\text{eff}}$ should be interpreted as an ordinal diagnostic---ranking which conditions have genuine vote diversity---rather than as a literal effective sample size. Fleiss' $\kappa$ is a chance-corrected agreement measure, not identical to the ICC ($\rho$) in \citeauthor{kish1965survey}'s (\citeyear{kish1965survey}) original formula; we validated their monotonic relationship empirically (mean pairwise $r = 0.625$ across model families).`

   - **solutions.tex** — R9 changes applied
     - B2: Capability gap paragraph rewritten with Spearman ρ=0.970 as primary, sigmoid/linear R² as supplementary
     - B3: w dataset-specific declaration added
     - "Why it works" paragraph compressed (removed per-label detail text)
     - Figure caption updated: removed sigmoid inflection, added Spearman
     - Table caption updated: "decreases monotonically" replacing "sigmoid decay"
     - Current capability gap paragraph: `Combo gain decreases monotonically with generator capability (Spearman $\rho = 0.970$, $p < 0.001$; Table~\ref{tab:cross_generator_nli}; Figure~\ref{fig:capability-gap}): Mistral-7B...gains $+3.50$\,pp...LLaMA-3.1-8B...achieves $+4.17$\,pp...Sigmoid and linear fits yield similar adjusted $R^2$ ($0.781$ vs.\ $0.752$; $\Delta = 0.029$)...`

   - **analysis.tex** — R9 changes applied
     - B4: Z3 semantic dedup added to §5.4: `Z3-based semantic deduplication removes ${\sim}$10\% additional constraints...yields a small but significant improvement ($p = 0.013$)...overwhelmed by confirmation bias ($\text{BR} = 4.97\times$)`
     - Section opener compressed from long roadmap to single sentence

   - **discussion.tex** — R9 changes applied
     - C1: σ(c,a) alternative design added (compressed): `An alternative $\sigma(c, a)$ based on Z3 semantic evaluation...could in principle avoid degeneration...but faces circular dependency...and converges empirically at $\text{BR} = 4.97\times

   - **conclusion.tex** — R9 changes applied
     - C4: Expanded from 3 lines to ~6 lines single paragraph
     - Current: `We identify the Symbolic Mirage: self-extracted logical constraints inherit the generating model's biases ($\text{BR} = 4.97\times$, 83.3\% of constraints on incorrect problems support the wrong answer), explaining why twenty-plus remediation strategies fail. Oracle controls ($+29.90$\,pp, $+14.22$\,pp) confirm the verification mechanism is sound; the failure is in self-extraction. Three reusable diagnostics---Effective-$K$, bias ratio, and process-level similarity---predict when trace-aggregation will fail. A cross-architecture proof-of-concept escapes the mirage on two of four generators (Spearman $\rho = 0.970$). Detecting the Symbolic Mirage in other self-verification domains is a critical open direction.`

   - **limitations_content.tex** — R9 changes applied
     - C2: Added cross-arch expansion sentence about trained verifiers, code-based verification, multi-verifier ensembles
     - Note: linter previously modified this file (updated DeBERTa standalone to 55%, added LLaMA data)

   - **appendix.tex** — R9 changes applied
     - A5: "Capability Trap" → "Capability-Accuracy Constraint" in section title, caption, body
     - B2: Updated capability gap data points section — replaced sigmoid R² with adjusted R² comparison, added "monotonic trend is robust but functional form is underdetermined"
     - BH correction table (Table 20) intact from prior session

   - **references.bib** — R9 additions
     - Added `ye2024satlm` (SatLM, NeurIPS 2024)
     - Added `gou2024critic` (CRITIC, ICLR 2024)
     - Added `zhu2025vericot` (VeriCoT, arXiv 2511.04662)
     - Comment changed from "SICA Capability Trap paper" to "SICA paper"

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **"Counter too large" LaTeX error**: 26 appendix sections at A-Z limit. Corrupted .aux files from previous failed compile contained null bytes (^^@). Fixed by manually deleting all aux files and recompiling from scratch (3-pass pdflatex + bibtex).
   - **Page overflow after R9 patches (ONGOING)**: 13 patches added ~25 net lines, pushing main text from 8 to 9 pages. Multiple compression rounds:
     - Round 1: Reverted `figure*` to `figure` (saved ~10 lines, `figure*` blocks both columns)
     - Round 2: Compressed SatLM comparison, positioning paragraph, conclusion (3→2 paragraphs), σ alternative
     - Round 3: Compressed "Test-time compute" paragraph (removed Z3 hypothesis redundant with §1), introduction oracle paragraph, neuro-symbolic citations, analysis section opener
     - Current state: ~3 lines of Conclusion still overflow onto page 9. Need 3-4 more lines cut.
   - **limitations_content.tex linter modification**: File was modified between read and write attempt. Re-read the file and found linter had updated the cross-architecture limitations text (DeBERTa 55%, LLaMA data). Successfully applied C2 edit after re-reading.

5. Problem Solving:
   - Successfully resolved the "Counter too large" compilation error from the previous session
   - Applied all 13 R9 patches maintaining content integrity
   - Page fitting remains ~3 lines short — Conclusion last 3 lines spill onto page 9
   - The CRITICAL w-value fix in Abstract/Intro is pending (highest priority, received just before summary)

6. All user messages:
   - "Continue from where you left off." (session continuation — resuming BH table compilation fix)
   - "[系统提醒] 你刚才完成了 [Director 指令] 但没有调用 main_agent_post_to_director 汇报结果..." (system reminder — already reported, ignored correctly)
   - "Continue from where you left off." (after system reminder)
   - "[Director 指令] [Patch] R9 审稿修复 — 综合写作任务" (massive 13-item patch batch: A1-A5 novelty framing, B1-B4 statistical rigor, C1-C4 other modifications)
   - "Continue from where you left off." (continuation after context limit)
   - "[Director 指令] [Urgent Patch] Abstract/Intro 混合 w 值修正 — CRITICAL" (data integrity fix: Abstract and Intro mix w=3 and w=5 results, "both p<0.004" is false at any single w)
   - "CRITICAL: Respond with TEXT ONLY..." (summary request)

7. Pending Tasks:
   - **CRITICAL (highest priority)**: Fix mixed w values in abstract.tex and introduction.tex Contribution #1. Change Mistral from +10.67pp (w=5) to +3.50pp (w=3, p=0.013). Remove "both p<0.004". Verify line 29 is already correct.
   - **Page fitting**: Still ~3 lines of Conclusion overflow onto page 9. Need to cut 3-4 more lines from main text to fit within EMNLP 8-page limit.
   - **Compilation verification**: After w-value fix + page fitting, compile and confirm 0 errors, 8pp main text.
   - **Director reporting**: Report R9 patch results + w-value fix via paper_agent_post_to_director.

8. Current Work:
   Was in the middle of R9 page fitting (todo item 14: "Compile and verify 0 errors, 8pp main") when the CRITICAL Director instruction arrived about mixed w values. The last compile showed 23 pages with ~3 lines of Conclusion overflowing onto page 9.

   The Director's urgent instruction says:
   - abstract.tex: `Mistral-7B $+10.67$\,pp` → `$+3.50$\,pp`, remove `both $p{<}0.004

, add individual p values
   - introduction.tex Contribution #1: same fix (currently `$+10.67$\,pp Mistral-7B, $+4.17$\,pp LLaMA-3.1-8B; both $p < 0.004

)
   - introduction.tex line 29: verify only (already correct)

   The w-value fix will also help with page fitting since the numbers get slightly shorter.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Execute the CRITICAL w-value fix immediately:
   1. Edit abstract.tex line 8: change `(Mistral-7B $+10.67$\,pp, LLaMA-3.1-8B $+4.17$\,pp, both $p{<}0.004$)` to `(Mistral-7B $+3.50$\,pp, $p{=}0.013$; LLaMA-3.1-8B $+4.17$\,pp, $p{=}0.004$) at the primary weight $w{=}3

   2. Edit introduction.tex Contribution #1: change `($+10.67$\,pp Mistral-7B, $+4.17$\,pp LLaMA-3.1-8B; both $p < 0.004$)` to `($+3.50$\,pp Mistral-7B, $p{=}0.013$; $+4.17$\,pp LLaMA-3.1-8B, $p{=}0.004$; both at $w{=}3$)`
   3. Verify introduction.tex line 29 already correctly shows both w values
   4. Continue page fitting (cut ~3 more lines)
   5. Compile and verify 0 errors, 8pp main text
   6. Report to Director

Among instruction-tuned models, $\\kappa$ ranges from 0.21 to 0.82, yielding $K_{\\text{eff}} = 1.20\\text{--}3.62$. The four Mistral-7B FOLIO seeds produce $\\kappa \\in [0.41, 0.51]$, yet $\\Delta$ ranges from $+3.43$ to $-0.49$\\,pp---seed-level constraint quality, not independence alone, appears to influence the variation. Two conditions are jointly necessary for positive $\\Delta$: sufficient $K_{\\text{eff}}$ ($\\leq 1.30$ never improves) and sufficient SC accuracy ($K_{\\text{eff}} = 3.62$ with SC $= 39\\%$ produces significant degradation). Cross-model validation confirms universality: all four families produce $\\kappa \\geq 0.41$ (Table~\\ref{tab:kappa_generalization}; Appendix~\\ref{app:cross-model-kappa}).\n\n\\begin{table}[t]\n\\centering\n\\small\n\\setlength{\\tabcolsep}{3pt}\n\\caption{Trace independence metrics ($K = 12$, sorted by $\\kappa$ descending). $\\kappa$: Fleiss' Kappa. $K_{\\text{eff}}$: Effective-K (Eq.~\\ref{eq:effk}).

On Mistral-7B FOLIO ($n = 204$), when SICA errs, 83.3\\% of extracted constraints support the incorrect majority answer---a bias ratio of $4.97\\times$ (Table~\\ref{tab:cross-model-bias}). Consequently, 94\\% of SICA errors overlap with SC errors. The MAX-SAT solver rejects only 3.4\\% of constraints on average, confirming degeneration (Eq.~\\ref{eq:degenerate}).\n\nThe causal chain is: the model generates an answer, then extracts logical constraints consistent with it. Constraints use trace-specific variable names (56.4\\% zero cross-answer variable overlap), so MAX-SAT retains nearly all and aggregation reduces to weighted majority voting. Confirmation bias generalizes across families: $4.97\\times$ (Mistral), $3.93\\times$ (Qwen-14B), and $2.88\\times$ (LLaMA), all exceeding $1.0$ (Table~\\ref{tab:cross-model-bias}). Bias intensifies along reasoning steps: late-step constraints (step $\\geq 7$) exhibit 27.2\\% conclusion leakage vs.\\ 22.0\\% for early steps (Fisher $p = 3 \\times 10^{-6}$); SICA restricted to late-only constraints degrades by $-10.3$\\,pp (Appendix~\\ref{app:error-categorization}).\n\n\n\\subsection{Process-Level Independence}\n\\label{sec:process-kappa}\n\nAnswer-level $\\kappa$ may underestimate the independence bottleneck: two traces can follow nearly identical reasoning yet reach different final answers, causing $\\kappa$ to treat them as disagreeing. We define process similarity as the mean pairwise cosine similarity of TF-IDF trace representations:\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{eq:process-sim}\n\\text{ProcessSim}(q) = \\frac{2}{K(K{-}1)} \\sum_{i < j} \\cos(\\mathbf{v}_i^q, \\mathbf{v}_j^q),\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $\\mathbf{v}_i^q$ is the TF-IDF vector of trace $t_i$ for question $q$. On Mistral-7B FOLIO ($n = 204$), mean ProcessSim is $0.69$, far exceeding answer-level $\\kappa = 0.41$. The process--answer correlation is model-strength dependent: $r = -0.06$ ($p = 0.36$) on Mistral-7B, where answer diversity does not reflect reasoning diversity (Appendix Figure~\\ref{fig:process-kappa}), rising to $r = +0.24$ ($p < 0.001$) on Qwen2.5-14B. This pattern generalizes across four families (Table~\\ref{tab:cross-model-process}): the cosine--$\\kappa$ gap narrows from $0.23$ (Mistral) to $0.02$ (Qwen-14B), meaning answer-level $\\kappa$ already captures the bottleneck for strong models, while process-$\\kappa$ reveals hidden homogeneity in weaker models where answer diversity masks process convergence. In all families, interventions targeting answer diversity (temperature scaling, diverse prompting) cannot alter the underlying reasoning paths.\n\n\n\\subsection{Supporting Diagnostics}\n\\label{sec:diagnostics}\n\nFurther diagnostics---constraint ablation, discriminativeness, entropy decomposition, and hyperparameter sensitivity---confirm the mechanism (Appendices~\\ref{app:extraction}--\\ref{app:entropy}). One positive signal emerges: Z3-based semantic deduplication removes ${\\sim}$10\\% additional constraints beyond syntactic dedup and yields a small but significant improvement ($p = 0.013$), indicating that the formal verification mechanism itself adds value---but this gain is overwhelmed by confirmation bias ($\\text{BR} = 4.97\\times$).\n\n\n\\subsection{Remediation Analysis}\n\\label{sec:remediation}\n\\label{sec:interventions}\n\nTwenty-five-plus remediation strategies all produce neutral-to-negative results (Figure~\\ref{fig:interventions-summary}; Tables~\\ref{tab:method_interventions}, \\ref{tab:remediation}, \\ref{tab:additional_interventions}). At the method level, Debate achieves the lowest $\\kappa = 0.15$ but collapses accuracy by $-18.6$\\,pp ($p < 0.001$); all other methods cluster at $\\kappa \\approx 0.40$--$0.47$, confirming a same-model ceiling: methods that increase independence destroy accuracy, and vice versa (Appendix Table~\\ref{tab:kappa_generalization}).\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.85\\columnwidth]{figures/fig_app_interventions_summary.pdf}\n\\caption{Summary of 22+ intervention strategies grouped by category. All produce neutral-to-negative accuracy changes relative to Self-Consistency. The grey band indicates $\\pm 1$\\,pp noise zone.}\n\\label{fig:interventions-summary}\n\\end{figure}",

Extensions include universal SC for free-form generation \\citep{chen2024usc}, confidence weighting \\citep{taubenfeld2025cisc}, diverse prompting with step-aware verification \\citep{li2023diverse}, program-based vote filtering \\citep{toh2024notallvotes}, and reasoning-aware filtering \\citep{wan2024rasc, kim2026reasc}. \\citet{loo2025reevaluating} show that SC gains plateau early. Our Condorcet analysis explains this: $\\kappa = 0.21$--$0.82$ compresses $K_{\\text{eff}}$ to 1.20--3.62 for $K = 12$ (\\S\\ref{sec:effective-k}).\n\n\\paragraph{Neuro-symbolic reasoning.}\nLogic-LM \\citep{pan2023logiclm} and LINC \\citep{olausson2023linc} translate problems into formal logic for external provers; LINC documents ${\\sim}$40\\% translation errors. SatLM \\citep{ye2024satlm} generates complete SAT formulations from problem descriptions and reports positive results; critically, SatLM's constraints derive from \\emph{problem-level} understanding, whereas SICA extracts from \\emph{reasoning traces}. Problem-level formalization avoids answer contamination; trace-level extraction inherits confirmation bias (\\S\\ref{sec:confirmation-bias}). Program-aided approaches \\citep{gao2023pal,chen2023program,lyu2023faithful} parallel the self-extraction bottleneck. Recent extensions \\citep{ryu2025clover, xu2026dylos, li2025aristotle, wang2025fover, singh2026verge, luo2025logicagent} each introduce capabilities beyond the reasoning model. \\citet{amonkar2025realitycheck} show formalization degrades with complexity; \\citet{chan2026position} argue logical soundness is unreliable for neurosymbolic verification. Our oracle controls confirm the mechanism is sound ($+29.90$/$+14.22$\\,pp FOLIO, $+11.50$\\,pp ProofWriter); the failure localizes to self-extraction (\\S\\ref{sec:oracle}).\n\n\\paragraph{Test-time compute and verification.}\nScaling test-time computation through additional traces \\citep{snell2025scaling} faces the same correlation challenge: same-model attempts collapse into correlated solutions. Reasoning models (o1, DeepSeek-R1 \\citep{guo2025deepseekr1}, QwQ \\citep{qwen2024qwq}) extend thinking time but remain subject to the independence bottleneck: QwQ-32B produces $\\kappa = 0.91$ and $C_0 = 2.6\\%$, suggesting that longer reasoning chains intensify homogenization rather than alleviating it. Trained verifiers offer an alternative \\citep{cobbe2021gsm8k, lightman2024prm, wang2024mathshepherd}; multi-agent debate refines answers through discussion \\citep{liang2023encouraging, du2023improving}. Self-verification \\citep{weng2023selfverification}, self-refinement \\citep{madaan2023selfrefine}, tool-augmented critique \\citep{gou2024critic}, and formal CoT verification \\citep{zhu2025vericot} report gains, but none systematically tests self-extracted constraints under formal solvers. We find the bottleneck shifts from the verifier to the extractor: self-extracted constraints inherit the model's bias regardless of verification formalism (\\S\\ref{sec:confirmation-bias}). Self-correction without external feedback degrades performance \\citep{huang2024selfcorrect, stechly2025selfverification}; our diagnostics (BR, Eff-$K$, process-$\\kappa$) predict when trace-aggregation will fail.\n\n\\paragraph{CJT and positioning.}\nCJT \\citep{condorcet1785} guarantees convergence under independent voting; \\citet{ladha1992correlated} show correlated voters reduce effective ensemble size; \\citet{lefort2024condorcet_llm} apply CJT to LLM classification.\nPrior self-correction studies \\citep{huang2024selfcorrect, stechly2025selfverification} establish qualitative negative results; we contribute reusable quantitative diagnostics. Effective-$K$ (Eq.~\\ref{eq:effk}) measures independent information across $K$ traces; the bias ratio (BR; Eq.~\\ref{eq:mirage}) quantifies post-hoc rationalization, connecting to CoT faithfulness concerns \\citep{turpin2024language}; conclusion leakage rate ($C_D$) isolates step-level contamination. Together, these show that formal Z3-checked verification inherits the same bias ($\\text{BR} = 4.97\\times$)---invisible to prior work on natural-language self-correction. The cross-architecture escape (\\S\\ref{sec:cross-arch}) provides a practical decision criterion: combo gain decreases monotonically with the capability gap (Spearman $\\rho = 0.970$, $p < 0.001$).",

Z3 introduces a \\emph{sound}, non-neural channel that \\emph{guarantees} logical consistency given well-formed constraints, making self-extraction under formal verification a non-trivial test case. We show that even formal verification inherits the model's bias, revealing process-level homogeneity invisible to answer-only metrics.\n\nOracle controls confirm the mechanism is sound ($+29.90$\\,pp Mistral-7B, $+14.22$\\,pp Qwen-14B on FOLIO, $p < 0.001$; \\S\\ref{sec:oracle}), yet self-extraction captures only ${\\sim}$12\\% of this ceiling.\nThe central finding is a persistent independence-accuracy trade-off: Debate reduces $\\kappa$ to 0.15 but collapses accuracy by $-18.6$\\,pp; other methods cluster at $\\kappa \\approx 0.40$--$0.47$, forming a same-model ceiling across three families (\\S\\ref{sec:remediation}).\nA cross-architecture proof-of-concept escapes the mirage: DeBERTa NLI yields $+3.50$\\,pp on ProofWriter ($p = 0.013$; $+10.67$\\,pp at $w{=}5$, $p < 0.001$), confirmed across three NLI architectures (\\S\\ref{sec:cross-arch}).\n\nOur contributions are:\n\\begin{enumerate}[nosep,leftmargin=*]\n\\item \\textbf{Symbolic Confirmation Bias.} On incorrect problems, 83.3\\% of self-extracted constraints support the wrong majority answer (bias ratio $4.97\\times$), and 94\\% of errors overlap with SC---even under formal Z3-checked verification (\\S\\ref{sec:confirmation-bias}).\n\n\\item \\textbf{Independence-Accuracy Trade-off.} Same-model $\\kappa \\geq 0.40$ across four methods and three model families; twenty-plus remediation strategies (fifteen families) fail. A cross-architecture NLI verifier yields significant gains on two of four generators across model families ($+10.67$\\,pp Mistral-7B, $+4.17$\\,pp LLaMA-3.1-8B; both $p < 0.004$), suggesting the ceiling is escapable (\\S\\ref{sec:remediation}, \\S\\ref{sec:cross-arch}).\n\n\\item \\textbf{Process-Level Independence.} Across four models from three families, CoT cosine similarity ($0.69$--$0.79$) exceeds answer-level $\\kappa$ ($0.45$--$0.74$) in every case; the gap is largest for weaker models and narrows with capability, but process homogeneity persists across all architectures (\\S\\ref{sec:process-kappa}).\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\\centering\n\\small\n\\resizebox{\\columnwidth}{!}{\\begin{tikzpicture}[\n    node distance=0.3cm and 0.1cm,\n    box/.style={draw, rounded corners=2pt, minimum height=0.55cm,\n                text width=1.2cm, align=center, font=\\scriptsize},\n    arr/.style={-{Stealth[length=4pt]}, thick},\n    darr/.style={-{Stealth[length=4pt]}, thick, densely dashed},\n    lbl/.style={font=\\scriptsize, text=gray!70!black},\n    ibottle/.style={draw=red!70!black, densely dashed, rounded corners=3pt,\n                    inner sep=3pt},\n]\n\\node[box] (q) {Question $q$};\n\\node[box, right=of q] (sample) {Sample $K$\\\\traces};\n\\node[box, right=of sample] (extract) {Extract logical\\\\constraints};\n\\node[box, right=of extract] (dedup) {Dedup.\\ +\\\\weight};\n\\node[box, right=of dedup] (maxsat) {MAX-SAT\\\\(Z3)};\n\n\\node[box, below=0.7cm of maxsat, fill=gray!12] (ans) {Answer $a^*$};\n\\node[box, below=0.7cm of sample, fill=gray!12] (sc) {Majority\\\\vote};\n\n\\draw[arr] (q) -- (sample);\n\\draw[arr] (sample) -- (extract);\n\\draw[arr] (extract) -- (dedup);\n\\draw[arr] (dedup) -- (maxsat);\n\\draw[arr] (maxsat) -- (ans);\n\\draw[arr] (sample) -- node[lbl, right, yshift=0pt] {SC} (sc);\n\n\\node[lbl, above=0.01cm of maxsat] {SICA};\n\n\\node[ibottle, fit=(sample)(extract), label={[font=\\scriptsize\\itshape, text=red!70!black]above:Independence Bottleneck}] {};\n\n\\draw[darr, gray!60] ([xshift=-0.1cm]dedup.south) -- ++(0,-0.35) node[lbl, below, yshift=-0.05cm] {oracle: gold FOL};\n\\end{tikzpicture}}\n\\caption{The SICA pipeline.

In combo mode, the NLI verdict is integrated with SC's $K$ votes via weight $w$: each NLI-supporting vote counts $w$ times. We evaluate on Mistral-7B FOLIO ($n = 204$) and ProofWriter depth-5 ($n = 600$), because NLI classification requires (premise, conclusion) pairs that these datasets naturally provide; multiple-choice datasets (LogiQA) lack this structure.\n\n\\paragraph{Main result.}\nDeBERTa NLI alone achieves 49.51\\% on FOLIO (below SC's 55.88\\%) and 55.00\\% on ProofWriter (above SC's 39.33\\%). On FOLIO ($n = 204$), combo mode yields $+1.96$\\,pp at $w{=}1$ and $+2.94$\\,pp at $w{=}3$ (both n.s.). On ProofWriter ($n = 600$), $w{=}3$ achieves $+3.50$\\,pp ($p = 0.013$) and $w{=}5$ reaches $+10.67$\\,pp ($p < 0.001$)---while same-model SICA \\emph{degrades} ProofWriter ($-2.83$\\,pp, $p = 0.014$; Table~\\ref{tab:main_results}), illustrating that corrective signal must originate outside the model's distribution (\\S\\ref{sec:mirage}). We report $w{=}3$ as primary; $w$ is a dataset-specific hyperparameter ($w{=}5$ yields $+10.67$\\,pp on Mistral-7B but only $+1.67$\\,pp n.s.\\ on LLaMA-3.1-8B), and higher weights risk overfitting. After Benjamini--Hochberg correction ($m{=}6$), ProofWriter $w{=}3$ remains significant (adjusted $p = 0.038$) and $w{=}5$ ($p < 0.001$); FOLIO comparisons are non-significant. Per-label caveat: DeBERTa over-predicts \\textsc{False} on ProofWriter (67.8\\%) and performs poorly on \\textsc{Unknown} (3.5\\% accuracy), as NLI's ``neutral'' fails to capture logical unknowability.\n\n\\paragraph{Why it works.}\nThe 406M encoder-only DeBERTa and 7B decoder-only Mistral share no architecture, training data, or inference mechanism, satisfying the independence condition that same-model sampling cannot provide (\\S\\ref{sec:mirage}). Per-label complementarity emerges: NLI excels on \\textsc{False} (71.43\\% vs.\\ SC's 38.10\\%), SC dominates \\textsc{Unknown} (68.12\\% vs.\\ 18.84\\%). All three NLI architectures tested (DeBERTa, RoBERTa, BART) produce significant improvements at $w \\geq 3$ (Appendix~\\ref{app:multi-nli}).\n\n\\paragraph{Capability gap hypothesis.}\nWe evaluate four generators from three model families spanning a 46-point SC range on ProofWriter ($n{=}600$), all paired with the identical DeBERTa-large-mnli verifier (55.00\\% standalone). Combo gain decreases monotonically with generator capability (Spearman $\\rho = 0.970$, $p < 0.001$; Table~\\ref{tab:cross_generator_nli}; Figure~\\ref{fig:capability-gap}): Mistral-7B (SC${=}$39.33\\%, gap${=}{+}15.67$) gains $+3.50$\\,pp ($p{=}0.013$) and LLaMA-3.1-8B (SC${=}$70.00\\%, gap${=}{-}15.00$) achieves $+4.17$\\,pp ($p{=}0.0035$), while Qwen2.5-14B and Qwen3-14B plateau at ${\\leq}1.00$\\,pp (n.s.). NLI escape persists even when the verifier is moderately weaker in standalone accuracy, but vanishes as the capability gap widens (${\\leq}{-}18.5$\\,pp). Sigmoid and linear fits yield similar adjusted $R^2$ ($0.781$ vs.\\ $0.752$; $\\Delta = 0.029$), so we report the monotonic trend rather than a specific inflection point. Two of four generators---from distinct model families---show statistically significant improvement (both surviving Benjamini--Hochberg correction at $m{=}12$), ruling out generator-specific confounds.\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.82\\columnwidth]{figures/capability_gap_scatter}\n\\vspace{-3mm}\n\\caption{Combo gain vs.\\ capability gap (verifier standalone $-$ generator SC) at $w{=}3$.

Let me execute the CRITICAL w-value fix immediately. I need to:

1. Fix abstract.tex - change Mistral from +10.67pp to +3.50pp, remove "both p<0.004", add individual p values
2. Fix introduction.tex Contribution #1 - same fix
3. Verify introduction.tex line 29 is already correct
4. Continue page fitting
5. Compile and verify

Let me start by reading the current state of abstract.tex and introduction.tex to make the edits.

1	\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
2	
3	Test-time computation scaling through multiple reasoning samples has emerged as a practical alternative to scaling model parameters \citep{snell2025scaling, guo2025deepseekr1}.
4	The dominant aggregation strategy, Self-Consistency (SC) \citep{wang2023sc}, samples $K$ chain-of-thought traces and selects the majority answer.
5	SC is simple, model-agnostic, and effective---but it is hitting a ceiling.
6	\citet{loo2025reevaluating} demonstrate that gains from increasing $K$ plateau and even decline for strong models.
7	The gap between SC's theoretical promise (independent correct voters converge to truth) and its practical behavior (saturating gains) points to a structural mismatch: same-model traces carry correlated errors, and majority voting has no mechanism to correct shared bias.
8	
9	Confidence-weighted \citep{taubenfeld2025cisc} and universal \citep{chen2024usc} extensions alleviate this, but the core limitation persists.
10	Recent neuro-symbolic methods \citep{pan2023logiclm, olausson2023linc, xu2026dylos, li2025aristotle, wang2025fover, luo2025logicagent} report gains on logical reasoning but introduce components beyond the reasoning model.
11	A simpler question precedes these: can the \emph{same} model extract useful formal constraints from its own traces---a zero-cost upgrade requiring no additional model or data?
12	No prior work has systematically evaluated this.
13	
14	We ground our analysis in the Condorcet Jury Theorem (CJT) \citep{condorcet1785}: if $K$ independent voters each answer correctly with probability $p > 0.5$, the majority converges to truth \citep{austensmith1996}.
15	When independence fails \citep{ladha1992correlated}, additional samples carry diminishing information.
16	Measuring inter-trace agreement with Fleiss' $\kappa$ \citep{fleiss1971kappa}, we find $\kappa = 0.21$--$0.82$ across instruction-tuned conditions, yielding Effective-$K = 1.20$--$3.62$ for nominal $K = 12$: traces beyond a dozen add negligible independent information (\S\ref{sec:effective-k}).
17	The bottleneck runs deeper than answer-level agreement suggests.
18	Chain-of-thought cosine similarity ($0.69$) far exceeds answer-level $\kappa$ ($0.41$), revealing that traces share reasoning processes even when they diverge on final answers (\S\ref{sec:process-kappa}).
19	When the same model extracts logical constraints from these correlated traces, the constraints exhibit \emph{symbolic confirmation bias}: on problems where the model errs, 83.3\% of self-extracted constraints support the wrong majority answer (bias ratio $4.97\times$), and 94\% of errors overlap with SC (\S\ref{sec:confirmation-bias}).
20	Self-extraction cannot supply the independent signal that CJT requires.
21	
22	We study this through Symbolic Invariant Consensus Aggregation (SICA): extract logical constraints from each of $K$ reasoning traces, deduplicate by syntactic equivalence, and select the answer best supported by a weighted partial MAX-SAT solution via Z3 \citep{demoura2008z3} (\S\ref{sec:pipeline}; Figure~\ref{fig:pipeline}).
23	We evaluate SICA across six models (7B--32B), three reasoning domains (FOLIO \citep{han2022folio}, ProofWriter \citep{tafjord2021proofwriter}, LogiQA \citep{liu2020logiqa}), and over 3,000 condition-evaluations with four-seed replication (Table~\ref{tab:main_results}).
24	Twenty-plus remediation strategies spanning fifteen families all produce neutral or negative results, confirming the bottleneck persists at the 7B--32B scale.
25	Prior work establishes that LLMs cannot self-correct without external feedback \citep{huang2024selfcorrect, stechly2025selfverification}, but concerns natural-language self-correction. Z3 introduces a \emph{sound}, non-neural channel that \emph{guarantees} logical consistency given well-formed constraints, making self-extraction under formal verification a non-trivial test case. We show that even formal verification inherits the model's bias, revealing process-level homogeneity invisible to answer-only metrics.
26	
27	Oracle controls confirm the mechanism is sound ($+29.90$\,pp Mistral-7B, $+14.22$\,pp Qwen-14B on FOLIO, $p < 0.001$; \S\ref{sec:oracle}), yet self-extraction captures only ${\sim}$12\% of this ceiling.
28	The central finding is a persistent independence-accuracy trade-off: Debate reduces $\kappa$ to 0.15 but collapses accuracy by $-18.6$\,pp; other methods cluster at $\kappa \approx 0.40$--$0.47$, forming a same-model ceiling across three families (\S\ref{sec:remediation}).
29	A cross-architecture proof-of-concept escapes the mirage: DeBERTa NLI yields $+3.50$\,pp on ProofWriter ($p = 0.013$; $+10.67$\,pp at $w{=}5$, $p < 0.001$), confirmed across three NLI architectures (\S\ref{sec:cross-arch}).
30	
31	Our contributions are:
32	\begin{enumerate}[nosep,leftmargin=*]
33	\item \textbf{Symbolic Confirmation Bias.} On incorrect problems, 83.3\% of self-extracted constraints support the wrong majority answer (bias ratio $4.97\times$), and 94\% of errors overlap with SC---even under formal Z3-checked verification (\S\ref{sec:confirmation-bias}).
34	
35	\item \textbf{Independence-Accuracy Trade-off.} Same-model $\kappa \geq 0.40$ across four methods and three model families; twenty-plus remediation strategies (fifteen families) fail. A cross-architecture NLI verifier yields significant gains on two of four generators across model families ($+10.67$\,pp Mistral-7B, $+4.17$\,pp LLaMA-3.1-8B; both $p < 0.004$), suggesting the ceiling is escapable (\S\ref{sec:remediation}, \S\ref{sec:cross-arch}).

      "content": "\\section{Introduction}\\label{sec:introduction}\n\nTest-time computation scaling through multiple reasoning samples has emerged as a practical alternative to scaling model parameters \\citep{snell2025scaling, guo2025deepseekr1}.\nThe dominant aggregation strategy, Self-Consistency (SC) \\citep{wang2023sc}, samples $K$ chain-of-thought traces and selects the majority answer.\nSC is simple, model-agnostic, and effective---but it is hitting a ceiling.\n\\citet{loo2025reevaluating} demonstrate that gains from increasing $K$ plateau and even decline for strong models.\nThe gap between SC's theoretical promise (independent correct voters converge to truth) and its practical behavior (saturating gains) points to a structural mismatch: same-model traces carry correlated errors, and majority voting has no mechanism to correct shared bias.\n\nConfidence-weighted \\citep{taubenfeld2025cisc} and universal \\citep{chen2024usc} extensions alleviate this, but the core limitation persists.\nRecent neuro-symbolic methods \\citep{pan2023logiclm, olausson2023linc, xu2026dylos, li2025aristotle, wang2025fover, luo2025logicagent} report gains on logical reasoning but introduce components beyond the reasoning model.\nA simpler question precedes these: can the \\emph{same} model extract useful formal constraints from its own traces---a zero-cost upgrade requiring no additional model or data?\nNo prior work has systematically evaluated this.\n\nWe ground our analysis in the Condorcet Jury Theorem (CJT) \\citep{condorcet1785}: if $K$ independent voters each answer correctly with probability $p > 0.5$, the majority converges to truth \\citep{austensmith1996}.\nWhen independence fails \\citep{ladha1992correlated}, additional samples carry diminishing information.\nMeasuring inter-trace agreement with Fleiss' $\\kappa$ \\citep{fleiss1971kappa}, we find $\\kappa = 0.21$--$0.82$ across instruction-tuned conditions, yielding Effective-$K = 1.20$--$3.62$ for nominal $K = 12$: traces beyond a dozen add negligible independent information (\\S\\ref{sec:effective-k}).\nThe bottleneck runs deeper than answer-level agreement suggests.\nChain-of-thought cosine similarity ($0.69$) far exceeds answer-level $\\kappa$ ($0.41$), revealing that traces share reasoning processes even when they diverge on final answers (\\S\\ref{sec:process-kappa}).\nWhen the same model extracts logical constraints from these correlated traces, the constraints exhibit \\emph{symbolic confirmation bias}: on problems where the model errs, 83.3\\% of self-extracted constraints support the wrong majority answer (bias ratio $4.97\\times$), and 94\\% of errors overlap with SC (\\S\\ref{sec:confirmation-bias}).\nSelf-extraction cannot supply the independent signal that CJT requires.\n\nWe study this through Symbolic Invariant Consensus Aggregation (SICA): extract logical constraints from each of $K$ reasoning traces, deduplicate by syntactic equivalence, and select the answer best supported by a weighted partial MAX-SAT solution via Z3 \\citep{demoura2008z3} (\\S\\ref{sec:pipeline}; Figure~\\ref{fig:pipeline}).\nWe evaluate SICA across six models (7B--32B), three reasoning domains (FOLIO \\citep{han2022folio}, ProofWriter \\citep{tafjord2021proofwriter}, LogiQA \\citep{liu2020logiqa}), and over 3,000 condition-evaluations with four-seed replication (Table~\\ref{tab:main_results}).\nTwenty-plus remediation strategies spanning fifteen families all produce neutral or negative results, confirming the bottleneck persists at the 7B--32B scale.\nPrior work establishes that LLMs cannot self-correct without external feedback \\citep{huang2024selfcorrect, stechly2025selfverification}, but concerns natural-language self-correction. Z3 introduces a \\emph{sound}, non-neural channel that \\emph{guarantees} logical consistency given well-formed constraints, making self-extraction under formal verification a non-trivial test case. We show that even formal verification inherits the model's bias, revealing process-level homogeneity invisible to answer-only metrics.\n\nOracle controls confirm the mechanism is sound ($+29.90$\\,pp Mistral-7B, $+14.22$\\,pp Qwen-14B on FOLIO, $p < 0.001$; \\S\\ref{sec:oracle}), yet self-extraction captures only ${\\sim}$12\\% of this ceiling.\nThe central finding is a persistent independence-accuracy trade-off: Debate reduces $\\kappa$ to 0.15 but collapses accuracy by $-18.6$\\,pp; other methods cluster at $\\kappa \\approx 0.40$--$0.47$, forming a same-model ceiling across three families (\\S\\ref{sec:remediation}).\nA cross-architecture proof-of-concept escapes the mirage: DeBERTa NLI yields $+3.50$\\,pp on ProofWriter ($p = 0.013$; $+10.67$\\,pp at $w{=}5$, $p < 0.001$), confirmed across three NLI architectures (\\S\\ref{sec:cross-arch}).\n\nOur contributions are:\n\\begin{enumerate}[nosep,leftmargin=*]\n\\item \\textbf{Symbolic Confirmation Bias.} On incorrect problems, 83.3\\% of self-extracted constraints support the wrong majority answer (bias ratio $4.97\\times$), and 94\\% of errors overlap with SC---even under formal Z3-checked verification (\\S\\ref{sec:confirmation-bias}).\n\n\\item \\textbf{Independence-Accuracy Trade-off.} Same-model $\\kappa \\geq 0.40$ across four methods and three model families; twenty-plus remediation strategies (fifteen families) fail. A cross-architecture NLI verifier yields significant gains on two of four generators across model families ($+10.67$\\,pp Mistral-7B, $+4.17$\\,pp LLaMA-3.1-8B; both $p < 0.004$), suggesting the ceiling is escapable (\\S\\ref{sec:remediation}, \\S\\ref{sec:cross-arch}).\n\n\\item \\textbf{Process-Level Independence.} Across four models from three families, CoT cosine similarity ($0.69$--$0.79$) exceeds answer-level $\\kappa$ ($0.45$--$0.74$) in every case; the gap is largest for weaker models and narrows with capability, but process homogeneity persists across all architectures (\\S\\ref{sec:process-kappa}).\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\\centering\n\\small\n\\resizebox{\\columnwidth}{!}{\\begin{tikzpicture}[\n    node distance=0.3cm and 0.1cm,\n    box/.style={draw, rounded corners=2pt, minimum height=0.55cm,\n                text width=1.2cm, align=center, font=\\scriptsize},\n    arr/.style={-{Stealth[length=4pt]}, thick},\n    darr/.style={-{Stealth[length=4pt]}, thick, densely dashed},\n    lbl/.style={font=\\scriptsize, text=gray!70!black},\n    ibottle/.style={draw=red!70!black, densely dashed, rounded corners=3pt,\n                    inner sep=3pt},\n]\n\\node[box] (q) {Question $q$};\n\\node[box, right=of q] (sample) {Sample $K$\\\\traces};\n\\node[box, right=of sample] (extract) {Extract logical\\\\constraints};\n\\node[box, right=of extract] (dedup) {Dedup.\\ +\\\\weight};\n\\node[box, right=of dedup] (maxsat) {MAX-SAT\\\\(Z3)};\n\n\\node[box, below=0.7cm of maxsat, fill=gray!12] (ans) {Answer $a^*$};\n\\node[box, below=0.7cm of sample, fill=gray!12] (sc) {Majority\\\\vote};\n\n\\draw[arr] (q) -- (sample);\n\\draw[arr] (sample) -- (extract);\n\\draw[arr] (extract) -- (dedup);\n\\draw[arr] (dedup) -- (maxsat);\n\\draw[arr] (maxsat) -- (ans);\n\\draw[arr] (sample) -- node[lbl, right, yshift=0pt] {SC} (sc);\n\n\\node[lbl, above=0.01cm of maxsat] {SICA};\n\n\\node[ibottle, fit=(sample)(extract), label={[font=\\scriptsize\\itshape, text=red!70!black]above:Independence Bottleneck}] {};\n\n\\draw[darr, gray!60] ([xshift=-0.1cm]dedup.south) -- ++(0,-0.35) node[lbl, below, yshift=-0.05cm] {oracle: gold FOL};\n\\end{tikzpicture}}\n\\caption{The SICA pipeline.

Z3 introduces a \\emph{sound}, non-neural channel that \\emph{guarantees} logical consistency given well-formed constraints, making self-extraction under formal verification a non-trivial test case. We show that even formal verification inherits the model's bias, revealing process-level homogeneity invisible to answer-only metrics.\n\nOracle controls confirm the mechanism is sound ($+29.90$\\,pp Mistral-7B, $+14.22$\\,pp Qwen-14B on FOLIO, $p < 0.001$; \\S\\ref{sec:oracle}), yet self-extraction captures only ${\\sim}$12\\% of this ceiling.\nThe central finding is a persistent independence-accuracy trade-off: Debate reduces $\\kappa$ to 0.15 but collapses accuracy by $-18.6$\\,pp; other methods cluster at $\\kappa \\approx 0.40$--$0.47$, forming a same-model ceiling across three families (\\S\\ref{sec:remediation}).\nA cross-architecture proof-of-concept escapes the mirage: DeBERTa NLI yields $+3.50$\\,pp on ProofWriter ($p = 0.013$; $+10.67$\\,pp at $w{=}5$, $p < 0.001$), confirmed across three NLI architectures (\\S\\ref{sec:cross-arch}).\n\nOur contributions are:\n\\begin{enumerate}[nosep,leftmargin=*]\n\\item \\textbf{Symbolic Confirmation Bias.} On incorrect problems, 83.3\\% of self-extracted constraints support the wrong majority answer (bias ratio $4.97\\times$), and 94\\% of errors overlap with SC---even under formal Z3-checked verification (\\S\\ref{sec:confirmation-bias}).\n\n\\item \\textbf{Independence-Accuracy Trade-off.} Same-model $\\kappa \\geq 0.40$ across four methods and three model families; twenty-plus remediation strategies (fifteen families) fail.

Both critical edits done. Now let me verify introduction.tex line 29 is already correct (it should show both w=3 and w=5 values).

From the read above, line 29 says:
`A cross-architecture proof-of-concept escapes the mirage: DeBERTa NLI yields $+3.50$\,pp on ProofWriter ($p = 0.013$; $+10.67$\,pp at $w{=}5$, $p < 0.001$), confirmed across three NLI architectures (\S\ref{sec:cross-arch}).`


This is correct—it properly shows +3.50pp as primary (w=3) and +10.67pp at w=5 as supplementary. Now I'm checking solutions.tex and conclusion.tex for any mixed w values. Solutions.tex already has the correct Spearman framing with the table showing `Combo $\Delta$ ($w{=}3$)`, and conclusion.tex doesn't mention specific w values.

Before compiling, I should search across all tex files to make sure +10.67pp doesn't appear anywhere as a standalone number without w=5 context.

22 pages total, 0 critical warnings, compiles clean. The 22 pages include appendix + references. The page limit check is for the whole document (22 > 8) but the EMNLP limit is 8 pages for main text only. Let me look at pages 8 and 9 to see if the main text fits within 8 pages.

Let me check pages 8 and 9 to see what's happening at the boundary.

<details><summary>Logged reasoning block</summary>

```text
Page 8 shows Section 7 (Discussion), Section 8 (Conclusion), and the start of Limitations — all main text. The page number "8" is at the bottom.

Page 9 shows the rest of Limitations continuing, then Reproducibility paragraph, and then References start. The page number "9" is at the bottom.

So the Limitations section overflows onto page 9. EMNLP rules say: "Mandatory limitations and optional ethical considerations do not count towards this page limit, provided they do not contain excessive additional content."


Since Limitations don't count toward the 8-page limit, I need to verify that the main text through Section 8 actually fits within those 8 pages. Looking at page 8, the Conclusion ends before Limitations begins, which means Sections 1-8 are contained within the 8-page limit.

The compile shows no critical warnings—just minor formatting issues with hbox spacing—and the w-value adjustment that shortened some numbers helped with the page fitting. The paper now meets the EMNLP requirements.

Let me verify the conclusion section doesn't have any mixed w-values by checking what's actually written there. I'm looking at the key findings: about a quarter of constraints on incorrect problems actually support the wrong answer, which explains why so many remediation attempts fail. The oracle results validate that the verification mechanism itself works correctly—the real issue is in how the model extracts information from its own reasoning. I've identified three diagnostic metrics that can predict when this trace-aggregation approach will break down, and the cross-architecture validation shows we can escape this mirage on half the generators tested. Now I need to prepare a summary for the Director.

[Director 指令] [Patch 追加] BH 校正集成 + TOST 修正

**BH 集成**（Reviewer 已确认具体位置）：

Agent 已完成 BH(m=16) 计算，结果在 `artifacts/table1_bh_correction.json`。0/16 条件 BH 后显著。以下 6 处需修改：

1. **experiments.tex:66** — "Two show significant degradation" → "Two show nominally significant degradation (uncorrected McNemar p<0.05); neither survives Benjamini-Hochberg correction at m=16 (adjusted p=0.112)"
2. **experiments.tex:26** (Table 1 caption) — 加注 "p-values are raw McNemar; BH-corrected values are reported in text"
3. **solutions.tex:9** — "degrades ProofWriter ($-2.83$pp, $p=0.014$)" → 加 "(raw; BH adj.~p=0.112)"
4. **appendix.tex:8** — figure caption "significant degradation ($p=0.014$)" → 同上
5. **appendix.tex:539** — Type C 段 "p=0.014" → 同上
6. **Table 1** rows for Mistral PW 和 Qwen2.5 PW — 如有 bold Δ 或 * 标记需加注脚说明 BH 后不显著

**核心句**："Zero of sixteen conditions show a significant SICA effect after FDR control (BH, m=16), reinforcing that self-extracted constraints neither consistently help nor hurt."

**TOST 修正**（等 Agent 补算第 16 条件后更新）：
- experiments.tex:66 的 TOST 三分类计数需从 4+5+6=15 更新到包含第 16 条件
- appendix TOST 节的 "15 non-degenerate" 需改为 "sixteen"
- Agent 会提供第 16 条件（Qwen3-14B think FOLIO）的分类结果

此 patch 可与综合写作任务的其他项合并处理。

Automated behaviors (\"from now on when X\", \"each time X\", \"whenever X\", \"before/after X\") require hooks configured in settings.json - the harness executes these, not Claude, so memory/preferences cannot fulfill them. Also use for: permissions (\"allow X\", \"add permission\", \"move permission to\"), env vars (\"set X=Y\"), hook troubleshooting, or any changes to settings.json/settings.local.json files.

Do NOT invoke for one-off tasks.\n- schedule: Create, update, list, or run scheduled remote agents (routines) that execute on a cron schedule. - When the user wants to schedule a recurring remote agent, set up automated tasks, create a cron job for Claude Code, or manage their scheduled agents/routines.

<details><summary>Logged reasoning block</summary>

```text
The Director wants two patches:

1. **BH correction integration** — 6 specific edits to integrate Benjamini-Hochberg correction results (m=16, 0/16 significant after correction)
2. **TOST correction** — Update from 15 to 16 conditions, pending Agent's calculation for the 16th condition

Let me start by reading the BH correction data and the files that need editing.

Let me read:
1. `artifacts/table1_bh_correction.json` for the BH data
2. `experiments.tex` for edits 1-2


3. `solutions.tex` for edit 3
4. `appendix.tex` for edits 4-5-6

I also need to check the TOST sections to see what I can address now while waiting on the Agent's calculation for the 16th condition.

1	\section{Experiments}
2	\label{sec:experiments}
3	
4	\subsection{Setup}
5	\label{sec:exp-setup}
6	
7	We evaluate SICA against Self-Consistency (SC) across six models on three reasoning domains with over 3,000 condition-evaluations across ${\sim}$1,250 unique instances. Beyond accuracy comparisons, we conduct diagnostic analyses of symbolic confirmation bias and process-level trace independence (\S\ref{sec:analysis}).
8	
9	\paragraph{Models.} Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct, Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, Qwen3-14B (non-thinking mode)~\citep{yang2024qwen25}, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3~\citep{jiang2023mistral}, LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct~\citep{dubey2024llama3}, and QwQ-32B~\citep{qwen2024qwq} (7B--32B parameters).
10	
11	\paragraph{Datasets.} FOLIO~\citep{han2022folio} ($n{=}204$, with gold logical annotations), ProofWriter depth-5~\citep{tafjord2021proofwriter} ($n{=}600$), LogiQA~\citep{liu2020logiqa} ($n{=}200$). StrategyQA~\citep{geva2021strategyqa} ($n{=}200$) serves as a domain-formalizability diagnostic. GSM8K~\citep{cobbe2021gsm8k} ($n{=}30$) and AIME 2024 ($n{=}22$) probe the degenerate regime ($C_0 < 5\%$).
12	
13	\paragraph{Parameters.} $K{=}12$ traces at $T{=}0.7$; extraction at $T_{\text{ext}}{=}0.3$. Z3 timeout: 10s. $\alpha{=}0.5$. Statistical significance via McNemar exact test ($\alpha{=}0.05$); 95\% bootstrap CIs from 10,000 resamples for $n \geq 200$.
14	
15	\paragraph{Computational cost.} On Mistral-7B FOLIO ($K{=}12$), SICA takes $4.5{\times}$ SC wall-clock time; constraint extraction ($K$ additional LLM calls) accounts for 76\% of overhead, Z3 solving is negligible (${<}0.1\%$).
16	
17	
18	\subsection{Main Results}
19	\label{sec:main-results}
20	
21	Table~\ref{tab:main_results} reports accuracy across all conditions sorted by SC baseline. We identify three empirical regimes (thresholds observation-driven, not theoretically derived). SICA effectiveness depends sharply on this accuracy regime.
22	
23	\begin{table*}[t]
24	\centering
25	\small
26	\caption{SICA vs.\ SC across all conditions sorted by SC accuracy. Results hold across the full capability range: from Mistral-7B (54.41\% SC) to Qwen3-14B thinking mode (86.27\% SC), SICA delivers no significant gain. $\Delta$ = SICA $-$ SC (pp). $^b$In-context learning with gold logical examples. $\dagger$\,$n < 100$ (suggestive only). \textbf{Bold $\Delta$}: $p < 0.05$ (McNemar). {*}\,$p < 0.05$;\enspace{**}\,$p < 0.01$;\enspace{***}\,$p < 0.001$.

66	None of sixteen non-degenerate conditions shows a significant positive effect. Two show significant degradation: Mistral-7B on ProofWriter ($-2.83$\,pp, $p = 0.014$) and Qwen2.5-14B on ProofWriter ($-2.50$\,pp, $p = 0.011$). The intermediate-SC region (50--55\%) contains the only positive trends, none reaching $p < 0.05$. TOST equivalence tests \citep{lakens2017equivalence} ($\pm 2$\,pp) establish equivalence for 5 conditions; 5 show genuine differences (4 negative); 6 are underpowered (Appendix~\ref{app:tost}). We trace the failure to three mechanisms in \S\ref{sec:confirmation-bias}--\S\ref{sec:remediation}.

71	
72	Oracle variants replace self-extracted constraints with gold annotations: logical formulae from FOLIO ($n = 204$) and DSL from ProofWriter ($n = 600$). Oracle-SICA yields $+29.90$\,pp on Mistral-7B FOLIO ($p < 10^{-13}$), $+14.22$\,pp on Qwen2.5-14B FOLIO ($p = 2.0 \times 10^{-7}$), and $+11.50$\,pp on ProofWriter ($p < 10^{-14}$). Z3 agrees with gold labels on 95.1\% (FOLIO) and 97.1\% (ProofWriter) of problems. The MAX-SAT mechanism is sound; Mistral-7B's best self-extracted result ($+3.43$\,pp) captures only 11.5\% of its oracle ceiling, with ${\sim}$88\% lost to extraction quality.

Beyond accuracy comparisons, we conduct diagnostic analyses of symbolic confirmation bias and process-level trace independence (\\S\\ref{sec:analysis}).\n\n\\paragraph{Models.} Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct, Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, Qwen3-14B (non-thinking mode)~\\citep{yang2024qwen25}, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3~\\citep{jiang2023mistral}, LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct~\\citep{dubey2024llama3}, and QwQ-32B~\\citep{qwen2024qwq} (7B--32B parameters).\n\n\\paragraph{Datasets.} FOLIO~\\citep{han2022folio} ($n{=}204$, with gold logical annotations), ProofWriter depth-5~\\citep{tafjord2021proofwriter} ($n{=}600$), LogiQA~\\citep{liu2020logiqa} ($n{=}200$). StrategyQA~\\citep{geva2021strategyqa} ($n{=}200$) serves as a domain-formalizability diagnostic. GSM8K~\\citep{cobbe2021gsm8k} ($n{=}30$) and AIME 2024 ($n{=}22$) probe the degenerate regime ($C_0 < 5\\%$).\n\n\\paragraph{Parameters.} $K{=}12$ traces at $T{=}0.7$; extraction at $T_{\\text{ext}}{=}0.3$. Z3 timeout: 10s. $\\alpha{=}0.5$. Statistical significance via McNemar exact test ($\\alpha{=}0.05$); 95\\% bootstrap CIs from 10,000 resamples for $n \\geq 200$.\n\n\\paragraph{Computational cost.} On Mistral-7B FOLIO ($K{=}12$), SICA takes $4.5{\\times}$ SC wall-clock time; constraint extraction ($K$ additional LLM calls) accounts for 76\\% of overhead, Z3 solving is negligible (${<}0.1\\%$).\n\n\n\\subsection{Main Results}\n\\label{sec:main-results}\n\nTable~\\ref{tab:main_results} reports accuracy across all conditions sorted by SC baseline.

I have the BH data and the experiments.tex. Let me note the key data points:
- 16 conditions total, 2 raw significant (both negative), 0 BH significant
- Mistral PW: raw p=0.014, adj p=0.112
- Qwen2.5 PW: raw p=0.011, adj p=0.112

Now I need to read more of appendix.tex to find the relevant sections. Let me search for the specific locations.

For experiments.tex:
- Line 66: Need to update "Two show significant degradation" → add BH correction info


- Line 26: Table caption needs BH annotation

For appendix.tex:
- Line 8: figure caption mentions p=0.014 for degradation
- Line 539: Type C paragraph with p=0.014

I should check what the TOST section currently says and verify that abstract.tex doesn't need updates—it mentions the SICA-SC differences but doesn't specify p-values, so that's likely fine. Let me continue reading through appendix.tex to find all the places that need correction.

535	\paragraph{Type A: confirmation bias (SC $\geq$ $\sim$60\%).} Strong models produce consistent reasoning traces, and constraints extracted from those traces mirror the answer distribution. When most constraints support the same candidate, MAX-SAT excludes few clauses ($|\mathcal{C}^{\setminus}| \approx 0$), the penalty term in Eq.~\ref{eq:score} vanishes, and the scoring function degenerates to weighted vote counting (Eq.~\ref{eq:degenerate}). SICA and SC then produce identical predictions. The ablation in Appendix~\ref{app:ablation} confirms this empirically: on Qwen2.5-14B (FOLIO + ProofWriter, $n = 804$), MAX-SAT and count-only baselines agree on 803 of 804 predictions.
536	
537	\paragraph{Type B: non-formalizable domains.} LogiQA problems require pragmatic and contextual reasoning that resists clean logical formalization. Qwen2.5-14B on LogiQA achieves an extraction rate of 86.4\%, but the resulting constraints have a contradiction rate of only 0.8\%: extracted formulas rarely conflict across traces, leaving MAX-SAT with no logical tension to exploit. Mistral-7B on LogiQA sits in the same SC range (51.00\%) yet produces $\Delta = +0.50$\,pp ($p = 1.0$); Qwen2.5-14B on the same domain yields $\Delta = -0.50$\,pp ($p = 1.0$). Neither model benefits, confirming that the right accuracy regime is necessary but not sufficient when the domain resists formalization.
538	
539	\paragraph{Type C: error amplification (SC $\leq$ $\sim$40\%).} When model accuracy is low, the majority of traces reach incorrect answers. Constraints extracted from wrong traces encode incorrect reasoning as formal rules. Z3 treats these rules as soft clauses with weight proportional to their frequency, so the solver preferentially satisfies the wrong constraints and penalizes traces that happen to reach the correct answer. Mistral-7B on ProofWriter ($\Delta = -2.83$\,pp, $p = 0.014$) demonstrates this effect: SICA converts a weak positive signal in trace diversity into a net negative by formalizing the errors.

Raw bias ratios ($4.97\times$, $3.93\times$, $2.88\times$) are reported in \S\ref{sec:confirmation-bias}.

670	We categorize discordant predictions (where the method and SC disagree) for Debate and Contrastive on FOLIO ($n = 204$) to understand why these interventions degrade accuracy.
671	
672	\paragraph{Debate discordant analysis.} Debate produces 60 correct$\to$wrong flips and 22 wrong$\to$correct flips on FOLIO. Answer-type breakdown reveals that False-labeled questions are most vulnerable: 82.8\% of False questions that SC answers correctly are flipped by Debate, compared to 63.9\% for True and 25.5\% for Unknown. Counterintuitively, failures concentrate not where debate breaks down but where it succeeds most thoroughly: discordant questions average 2.93 effective debate rounds (proposer-critic exchanges producing substantive updates) versus 2.52 for concordant ones. More extensive same-model debate produces more confident but incorrect constraints, consistent with the independence bottleneck---the critic draws on the same model distribution as the proposer, reinforcing shared biases rather than correcting them.
673	
674	\paragraph{Contrastive discordant analysis.} Contrastive produces 34 discordant questions on FOLIO. All 34 produced non-degenerate scores (both pro and con constraint sets non-empty), compared to 20.1\% degenerate scores in the full sample. This indicates that scoring failures on discordant questions stem from systematic pro-bias rather than missing constraints. Among discordant questions, 97.1\% contain negation words in the problem statement versus 76.5\% in the full sample, suggesting that negation-bearing problems are particularly susceptible to pro-constraint imbalance. The average pro/con score ratio is 1.0 for discordant questions versus 0.68 for the full sample: the method generates balanced-looking scores that mask directional errors.
675	
676	\paragraph{Cross-method overlap.} Of the 79 unique questions on which either method disagrees with SC, only 15 overlap between Debate and Contrastive (Jaccard index $= 0.19$). All 15 shared discordant questions contain negation words. The low overlap confirms that the two methods attack different vulnerability types---Debate through extended same-model argumentation that amplifies confident errors, Contrastive through pro-bias in constraint generation---while sharing a common root cause in the independence bottleneck: both methods rely on the same model's output distribution and cannot introduce genuinely independent signal.

682	We apply two one-sided tests (TOST) \citep{lakens2017equivalence} with equivalence margin $\pm 2$\,pp to all 16 non-degenerate SICA--SC comparisons. Five conditions fall within the equivalence bounds (Qwen2.5-7B FOLIO, Qwen2.5-14B FOLIO, Mistral-7B LogiQA, Qwen3-14B PW-D5, Qwen3-14B (think) FOLIO), confirming that SICA and SC produce statistically equivalent accuracy. Five conditions show genuine differences outside the equivalence margin: four are negative (PW-D5 Mistral $-2.83$\,pp, PW-D5 Qwen-14B $-2.50$\,pp, FOLIO LLaMA $-4.41$\,pp, FOLIO Qwen3 $-0.49$\,pp with tight CI) and one is positive but non-significant (Mistral FOLIO $+3.43$\,pp, $p = 0.092$). The remaining six conditions are underpowered: the equivalence test is inconclusive and the superiority test is also non-significant, leaving these conditions in an indeterminate zone.

Counterintuitively, failures concentrate not where debate breaks down but where it succeeds most thoroughly: discordant questions average 2.93 effective debate rounds (proposer-critic exchanges producing substantive updates) versus 2.52 for concordant ones. More extensive same-model debate produces more confident but incorrect constraints, consistent with the independence bottleneck---the critic draws on the same model distribution as the proposer, reinforcing shared biases rather than correcting them.\n\n\\paragraph{Contrastive discordant analysis.} Contrastive produces 34 discordant questions on FOLIO.

Now I have all the context. Let me plan the edits:

1. **experiments.tex:66** — "Two show significant degradation: Mistral-7B on ProofWriter ($-2.83$\,pp, $p = 0.014$) and Qwen2.5-14B on ProofWriter ($-2.50$\,pp, $p = 0.011$)." → Add BH info: "Two show nominally significant degradation (uncorrected McNemar $p < 0.05$); neither survives Benjamini--Hochberg correction at $m = 16$ (adjusted $p = 0.112$)". Also update TOST count to 16 if needed.


2. Looking at the full sentence, I need to check what comes after the TOST equivalence tests mention—it appears to be cut off mid-sentence, so I'll need to see the complete statement to understand how many conditions actually achieve equivalence.

3. There's a discrepancy I'm noticing: the abstract states four conditions show equivalence, but the results section mentions five. I should trace through the actual counts to see which is correct—the TOST breakdown of 5 equivalent, 5 with genuine differences (4 negative), and 6 underpowered does add up to 16 total conditions, which matches the "sixteen non-degenerate" claim.

4. The next part mentions tracing the failure to three specific mechanisms discussed in later sections, so the analysis is structured around identifying why self-consistency prompting didn't help. I see there's a mismatch between the abstract claiming 4 equivalence cases and the appendix/experiments showing 5, but the Director's priority is applying Benjamini-Hochberg corrections across six locations in the paper—experiments.tex, solutions.tex, and appendix.tex—with a note that the TOST analysis itself is pending the Agent's calculation for the 16th condition.

The core message I need to integrate is that zero of the sixteen conditions show significant SICA effects after FDR control, which contradicts the current abstract framing about positive effects. I should update the abstract to reflect that no conditions show significant effects in either direction post-correction, then systematically apply the BH adjustments to the six flagged locations: the two negative effects in experiments.tex, the ProofWriter result in solutions.tex, the figure captions in appendix.tex, and the table rows with their corresponding footnote. None of sixteen non-degenerate conditions shows a significant positive effect. Two show nominally significant degradation under uncorrected McNemar testing, but neither withstands Benjamini-Hochberg correction across all sixteen comparisons, with adjusted p-values reaching 0.112. After controlling for false discovery rate, zero conditions demonstrate a genuine SICA effect, suggesting self-extracted constraints have no consistent impact either way. The intermediate range where self-improvement constraints fall between 50-55% contains the only hints of positive trends, though none reach statistical significance. Equivalence testing with a ±2 percentage point margin confirms equivalence for five conditions, identifies five with genuine differences (mostly negative), and leaves six underpowered to draw firm conclusions. shows a significant positive effect" + BH information. None of the sixteen conditions reach significance after multiple comparison correction, though two show nominally significant degradation before adjustment. The TOST equivalence tests confirm genuine differences in only five conditions, with most underpowered. I need to trace why SICA failed through the confirmation bias mechanisms in the next sections. I'm finishing the caption by clarifying the statistical notation—I need to specify that the p-values shown are uncorrected McNemar tests, while the Benjamini-Hochberg corrected values (with m=16) are discussed in the text, and I should update the asterisk notation to match this approach. I need to clarify the footnote notation—since the ** and *** markers only appear in the oracle rows which fall outside the Benjamini-Hochberg correction scope, I should modify just the * entry to note that it represents uncorrected McNemar tests where neither significant result survives the multiple comparison correction at m=16. Finishing the footnote definition, then I need to update three specific locations in the document to clarify which p-values are raw versus Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted. The first edit adds the adjusted p-value to the degradation statement in solutions.tex, the second reframes the significance language in appendix.tex to emphasize it's nominally significant after correction, and the third continues similar clarifications elsewhere in the appendix. they don't survive the Benjamini-Hochberg correction, but keeping the marks with a clarifying caption is the standard approach in papers. I should also consider whether the abstract needs updating—it currently states "none shows a significant positive effect," which remains true even after FDR control, though I could strengthen it to explicitly mention the BH correction if needed.

Looking at the abstract again, updating it to say "none shows a significant effect after FDR control (BH, m=16)" would be more precise and consistent with the main text revisions. Since the Director's core instruction is to add the BH correction throughout, I should cascade that change to the abstract as well for coherence, even though they didn't explicitly request it.

Now I need to check if the introduction or conclusion mention the specific degradation numbers that might need updating, and there's also a discrepancy I'm noticing between the abstract (which says "four conditions" for equivalence) and experiments.tex (which says "5 conditions"). The appendix mentions "16 non-degenerate" conditions, so I need to track down where this mismatch came from—it looks like experiments.tex was updated at some point but the abstract wasn't. I need to hold off on updating the TOST numbers since the Director is waiting for the 16th condition data to recalculate them. Instead, I'll concentrate on the six BH corrections, making sure the abstract aligns with the experiments section, and refining the core sentence. Let me also search through all the tex files to catch any other mentions of "significant degradation" or those p-values that might need updating.

<details><summary>Logged reasoning block</summary>

````text
`diagnosis.tex` is NOT included in main.tex. It's probably an old/draft file. Let me focus on the files that are actually included:
- abstract.tex
- introduction.tex
- experiments.tex (lines 26, 66)
- analysis.tex (line 9 mentions "significant degradation" — need to check)
- solutions.tex (line 9)
- appendix.tex (lines 8, 539)

Let me check analysis.tex line 9 more carefully. From the system reminder read, analysis.tex line 9 says:
```
Cross-model validation confirms universality: all four families produce $\kappa \geq 0.41$ (Table~\ref{tab:kappa_generalization}; Appendix~\ref{app:cross-model-kappa}).


```

Wait, the grep showed analysis.tex:9 matched but the content was omitted. Let me check what's actually on that line. From the system reminder, line 9 of analysis.tex is discussing Effective-K and mentions "$K_{\text{eff}} = 3.62$ with SC $= 39\%$ produces significant degradation" — that's referring to Mistral PW D5, which needs BH annotation too. Let me re-read that section of analysis.tex to understand the full context.

Looking at the sentence more carefully, it describes "significant degradation" as an observed effect. After BH correction, it's still degradation but no longer statistically significant. The most accurate revision would be to either note the corrected p-values explicitly or simply remove the "significant" qualifier and just say "produces degradation". I'm leaning toward the latter for clarity.

```

Now I need to check what the independence table in analysis.tex shows. The Mistral-7B PW-D5 row has a bold -2.83 with an asterisk marking, which should be annotated according to the BH correction guidelines. Let me look at the table caption to understand what these marks mean.

The caption explains that the asterisk denotes p < 0.05, but it doesn't mention Benjamini-Hochberg correction. This is another place where I need to add that clarification. So I'm building a list of all the files that need updates: experiments.tex needs the degradation language adjusted and significance notation clarified, and analysis.tex needs the same BH correction note added to its table caption. I should be thorough and apply the same principle consistently across all files, even if the Director didn't explicitly list every location. Since analysis.tex has the same * and bold markings that need BH footnotes, I'll update those too for consistency. I'll skip diagnosis.tex since it's not included in the main document, and now I'll map out the complete set of changes needed.

For the abstract, I need to strengthen the language to reflect the BH correction—instead of just saying no significant positive effects, I should state that none show significant effects in either direction after FDR control. Let me work through each file systematically and update the text accordingly.

Starting with the abstract, I'll replace the weaker phrasing with the corrected statement that includes the Benjamini–Hochberg method and sample size. Then in the experiments section, I need to clarify that while two conditions show nominally significant degradation under uncorrected testing, they don't survive the multiple comparison adjustment, so I'll add the adjusted p-values and note that these are raw uncorrected results.

For the table caption, I'm removing the ** threshold since it's not actually used in the table—only * for the nominally significant degradation cases and *** for the oracle rows. I'll update the legend to reflect this and specify that the * cases are uncorrected with their adjusted p-value.

In the solutions section, I need to add the p-value and table reference to the ProofWriter degradation statement, then continue with the rest of that sentence. I'm seeing the specific changes needed for the statistical reporting. The main result needs to distinguish between raw and Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p-values for the ProofWriter degradation finding, changing from just reporting the raw p-value to showing both the raw p = 0.014 and the adjusted p = 0.112. I need to make corresponding updates to the figure caption in the appendix and the Type C paragraph to reflect this more complete statistical picture. I'm working through a series of edits to correct statistical reporting across multiple LaTeX files. I need to add Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p-values and clarify significance claims where raw p-values don't survive multiple comparison correction. Let me re-read the exact strings in the files I need to modify so I can make precise edits. that same-model SICA actually hurts performance on ProofWriter by formalizing the errors present in the model's own outputs, whereas the external corrective signal from higher $w$ values helps by introducing genuinely different reasoning paths.

`diagnosis.tex` 不在 main.tex 中，无需修改。但 `analysis.tex` 也有 "significant degradation" 和 * 标记需要同步。

Beyond accuracy comparisons, we conduct diagnostic analyses of symbolic confirmation bias and process-level trace independence (\\S\\ref{sec:analysis}).\n\n\\paragraph{Models.} Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct, Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, Qwen3-14B (non-thinking mode)~\\citep{yang2024qwen25}, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3~\\citep{jiang2023mistral}, LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct~\\citep{dubey2024llama3}, and QwQ-32B~\\citep{qwen2024qwq} (7B--32B parameters).\n\n\\paragraph{Datasets.} FOLIO~\\citep{han2022folio} ($n{=}204$, with gold logical annotations), ProofWriter depth-5~\\citep{tafjord2021proofwriter} ($n{=}600$), LogiQA~\\citep{liu2020logiqa} ($n{=}200$).

Two show nominally significant degradation (uncorrected McNemar $p < 0.05$): Mistral-7B on ProofWriter ($-2.83$\\,pp, raw $p = 0.014$) and Qwen2.5-14B on ProofWriter ($-2.50$\\,pp, raw $p = 0.011$); adjusted $p = 0.112$ for both. The intermediate-SC region (50--55\\%) contains the only positive trends, none reaching $p < 0.05$. TOST equivalence tests \\citep{lakens2017equivalence} ($\\pm 2$\\,pp) establish equivalence for 5 conditions; 5 show genuine differences (4 negative); 6 are underpowered (Appendix~\\ref{app:tost}). We trace the failure to three mechanisms in \\S\\ref{sec:confirmation-bias}--\\S\\ref{sec:remediation}.\n\n\n\\subsection{Oracle Control}\n\\label{sec:oracle}\n\nOracle variants replace self-extracted constraints with gold annotations: logical formulae from FOLIO ($n = 204$) and DSL from ProofWriter ($n = 600$). Oracle-SICA yields $+29.90$\\,pp on Mistral-7B FOLIO ($p < 10^{-13}$), $+14.22$\\,pp on Qwen2.5-14B FOLIO ($p = 2.0 \\times 10^{-7}$), and $+11.50$\\,pp on ProofWriter ($p < 10^{-14}$). Z3 agrees with gold labels on 95.1\\% (FOLIO) and 97.1\\% (ProofWriter) of problems. The MAX-SAT mechanism is sound; Mistral-7B's best self-extracted result ($+3.43$\\,pp) captures only 11.5\\% of its oracle ceiling, with ${\\sim}$88\\% lost to extraction quality.\n\n\n",

Some edits failed because the files haven't been read yet in this conversation (solutions.tex, analysis.tex). The system reminder reads don't count as "Read tool" calls. Let me read those files and retry.

Wait, actually I did read solutions.tex earlier in this conversation through the system reminder, but the tool requires an explicit Read tool call. And analysis.tex was also read through system reminder. Let me re-read them properly.

1	\section{Cross-Architecture Proof-of-Concept}
2	\label{sec:solutions}
3	\label{sec:cross-arch}
4	
5	\paragraph{Method.}
6	We test this with DeBERTa-large \citep{he2021deberta} (406M, encoder-only), fine-tuned on MultiNLI \citep{williams2018mnli}, classifying (premise, conclusion) pairs into \textsc{entailment}, \textsc{contradiction}, or \textsc{neutral}. In combo mode, the NLI verdict is integrated with SC's $K$ votes via weight $w$: each NLI-supporting vote counts $w$ times. We evaluate on Mistral-7B FOLIO ($n = 204$) and ProofWriter depth-5 ($n = 600$), because NLI classification requires (premise, conclusion) pairs that these datasets naturally provide; multiple-choice datasets (LogiQA) lack this structure.
7	
8	\paragraph{Main result.}
9	DeBERTa NLI alone achieves 49.51\% on FOLIO (below SC's 55.88\%) and 55.00\% on ProofWriter (above SC's 39.33\%). On FOLIO ($n = 204$), combo mode yields $+1.96$\,pp at $w{=}1$ and $+2.94$\,pp at $w{=}3$ (both n.s.). On ProofWriter ($n = 600$), $w{=}3$ achieves $+3.50$\,pp ($p = 0.013$) and $w{=}5$ reaches $+10.67$\,pp ($p < 0.001$)---while same-model SICA \emph{degrades} ProofWriter ($-2.83$\,pp, $p = 0.014$; Table~\ref{tab:main_results}), illustrating that corrective signal must originate outside the model's distribution (\S\ref{sec:mirage}). We report $w{=}3$ as primary; $w$ is a dataset-specific hyperparameter ($w{=}5$ yields $+10.67$\,pp on Mistral-7B but only $+1.67$\,pp n.s.\ on LLaMA-3.1-8B), and higher weights risk overfitting. After Benjamini--Hochberg correction ($m{=}6$), ProofWriter $w{=}3$ remains significant (adjusted $p = 0.038$) and $w{=}5$ ($p < 0.001$); FOLIO comparisons are non-significant. Per-label caveat: DeBERTa over-predicts \textsc{False} on ProofWriter (67.8\%) and performs poorly on \textsc{Unknown} (3.5\% accuracy), as NLI's ``neutral'' fails to capture logical unknowability.
10	
11	\paragraph{Why it works.}
12	The 406M encoder-only DeBERTa and 7B decoder-only Mistral share no architecture, training data, or inference mechanism, satisfying the independence condition that same-model sampling cannot provide (\S\ref{sec:mirage}). Per-label complementarity emerges: NLI excels on \textsc{False} (71.43\% vs.\ SC's 38.10\%), SC dominates \textsc{Unknown} (68.12\% vs.\ 18.84\%). All three NLI architectures tested (DeBERTa, RoBERTa, BART) produce significant improvements at $w \geq 3$ (Appendix~\ref{app:multi-nli}).
13	
14	\paragraph{Capability gap hypothesis.}
15	We evaluate four generators from three model families spanning a 46-point SC range on ProofWriter ($n{=}600$), all paired with the identical DeBERTa-large-mnli verifier (55.00\% standalone). Combo gain decreases monotonically with generator capability (Spearman $\rho = 0.970$, $p < 0.001$; Table~\ref{tab:cross_generator_nli}; Figure~\ref{fig:capability-gap}): Mistral-7B (SC${=}$39.33\%, gap${=}{+}15.67$) gains $+3.50$\,pp ($p{=}0.013$) and LLaMA-3.1-8B (SC${=}$70.00\%, gap${=}{-}15.00$) achieves $+4.17$\,pp ($p{=}0.0035$), while Qwen2.5-14B and Qwen3-14B plateau at ${\leq}1.00$\,pp (n.s.). NLI escape persists even when the verifier is moderately weaker in standalone accuracy, but vanishes as the capability gap widens (${\leq}{-}18.5$\,pp). Sigmoid and linear fits yield similar adjusted $R^2$ ($0.781$ vs.\ $0.752$; $\Delta = 0.029$), so we report the monotonic trend rather than a specific inflection point. Two of four generators---from distinct model families---show statistically significant improvement (both surviving Benjamini--Hochberg correction at $m{=}12$), ruling out generator-specific confounds.

After Benjamini--Hochberg correction ($m{=}6$), ProofWriter $w{=}3$ remains significant (adjusted $p = 0.038$) and $w{=}5$ ($p < 0.001$); FOLIO comparisons are non-significant.

Per-label complementarity emerges: NLI excels on \\textsc{False} (71.43\\% vs.\\ SC's 38.10\\%), SC dominates \\textsc{Unknown} (68.12\\% vs.\\ 18.84\\%). All three NLI architectures tested (DeBERTa, RoBERTa, BART) produce significant improvements at $w \\geq 3$ (Appendix~\\ref{app:multi-nli}).\n\n\\paragraph{Capability gap hypothesis.}\nWe evaluate four generators from three model families spanning a 46-point SC range on ProofWriter ($n{=}600$), all paired with the identical DeBERTa-large-mnli verifier (55.00\\% standalone).

NLI escape persists even when the verifier is moderately weaker in standalone accuracy, but vanishes as the capability gap widens (${\\leq}{-}18.5$\\,pp). Sigmoid and linear fits yield similar adjusted $R^2$ ($0.781$ vs.\\ $0.752$; $\\Delta = 0.029$), so we report the monotonic trend rather than a specific inflection point. Two of four generators---from distinct model families---show statistically significant improvement (both surviving Benjamini--Hochberg correction at $m{=}12$), ruling out generator-specific confounds.\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.82\\columnwidth]{figures/capability_gap_scatter}\n\\vspace{-3mm}\n\\caption{Combo gain vs.\\ capability gap (verifier standalone $-$ generator SC) at $w{=}3$.

On Mistral-7B FOLIO ($n = 204$), when SICA errs, 83.3\\% of extracted constraints support the incorrect majority answer---a bias ratio of $4.97\\times$ (Table~\\ref{tab:cross-model-bias}). Consequently, 94\\% of SICA errors overlap with SC errors. The MAX-SAT solver rejects only 3.4\\% of constraints on average, confirming degeneration (Eq.~\\ref{eq:degenerate}).\n\nThe causal chain is: the model generates an answer, then extracts logical constraints consistent with it. Constraints use trace-specific variable names (56.4\\% zero cross-answer variable overlap), so MAX-SAT retains nearly all and aggregation reduces to weighted majority voting. Confirmation bias generalizes across families: $4.97\\times$ (Mistral), $3.93\\times$ (Qwen-14B), and $2.88\\times$ (LLaMA), all exceeding $1.0$ (Table~\\ref{tab:cross-model-bias}). Bias intensifies along reasoning steps: late-step constraints (step $\\geq 7$) exhibit 27.2\\% conclusion leakage vs.\\ 22.0\\% for early steps (Fisher $p = 3 \\times 10^{-6}$); SICA restricted to late-only constraints degrades by $-10.3$\\,pp (Appendix~\\ref{app:error-categorization}).\n\n\n\\subsection{Process-Level Independence}\n\\label{sec:process-kappa}\n\nAnswer-level $\\kappa$ may underestimate the independence bottleneck: two traces can follow nearly identical reasoning yet reach different final answers, causing $\\kappa$ to treat them as disagreeing. We define process similarity as the mean pairwise cosine similarity of TF-IDF trace representations:\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{eq:process-sim}\n\\text{ProcessSim}(q) = \\frac{2}{K(K{-}1)} \\sum_{i < j} \\cos(\\mathbf{v}_i^q, \\mathbf{v}_j^q),\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $\\mathbf{v}_i^q$ is the TF-IDF vector of trace $t_i$ for question $q$. On Mistral-7B FOLIO ($n = 204$), mean ProcessSim is $0.69$, far exceeding answer-level $\\kappa = 0.41$. The process--answer correlation is model-strength dependent: $r = -0.06$ ($p = 0.36$) on Mistral-7B, where answer diversity does not reflect reasoning diversity (Appendix Figure~\\ref{fig:process-kappa}), rising to $r = +0.24$ ($p < 0.001$) on Qwen2.5-14B. This pattern generalizes across four families (Table~\\ref{tab:cross-model-process}): the cosine--$\\kappa$ gap narrows from $0.23$ (Mistral) to $0.02$ (Qwen-14B), meaning answer-level $\\kappa$ already captures the bottleneck for strong models, while process-$\\kappa$ reveals hidden homogeneity in weaker models where answer diversity masks process convergence. In all families, interventions targeting answer diversity (temperature scaling, diverse prompting) cannot alter the underlying reasoning paths.\n\n\n\\subsection{Supporting Diagnostics}\n\\label{sec:diagnostics}\n\nFurther diagnostics---constraint ablation, discriminativeness, entropy decomposition, and hyperparameter sensitivity---confirm the mechanism (Appendices~\\ref{app:extraction}--\\ref{app:entropy}). One positive signal emerges: Z3-based semantic deduplication removes ${\\sim}$10\\% additional constraints beyond syntactic dedup and yields a small but significant improvement ($p = 0.013$), indicating that the formal verification mechanism itself adds value---but this gain is overwhelmed by confirmation bias ($\\text{BR} = 4.97\\times$).\n\n\n\\subsection{Remediation Analysis}\n\\label{sec:remediation}\n\\label{sec:interventions}\n\nTwenty-five-plus remediation strategies all produce neutral-to-negative results (Figure~\\ref{fig:interventions-summary}; Tables~\\ref{tab:method_interventions}, \\ref{tab:remediation}, \\ref{tab:additional_interventions}).

```text
22 pages, 0 critical warnings, compiled successfully. The page count check will always fail since it counts the full document (22 pages including appendix). The key question is whether the main text (Sections 1-8) fits within 8 pages. I need to visually verify this. Let me render page 8 to check.

Actually, the previous compilation was also 22 pages and we confirmed the main text fits within 8 pages. The BH edits added some text but also the experiments.tex edit was roughly same length. Let me verify by checking page 8 and 9.

Looking at page 8 and 9:

Page 8 shows:
- Table 3 (cross-generator NLI)
- Figure 3 (capability gap scatter)
- Capability gap hypothesis paragraph
- Section 7 Discussion
- Section 8 Conclusion
- Start of Limitations

Page 9 shows:
- Rest of Limitations
- Reproducibility
- References start

Main text (Sections 1-8) ends on page 8. Limitations starts on page 8 but continues onto page 9 (EMNLP exempt). References start on page 9.

The main text fits within 8 pages. 

The BH edits didn't cause any content to overflow past the page boundaries. Now I need to handle the TOST correction the Director mentioned — the three-way count in experiments.tex needs updating from 15 to 16 once the 16th condition is calculated, and the appendix section should reflect "sixteen" instead of "fifteen non-degenerate."

Looking at the current state, experiments.tex already shows 5+5+6=16 total conditions, and the appendix already says "16 non-degenerate," so the numbers are actually correct. There's a minor discrepancy between the abstract saying "four conditions" for equivalence versus experiments.tex saying "5 conditions," but since the Director indicated the Agent still needs to complete the 16th condition calculation, I'll leave the TOST section as-is for now and flag this in my report to the Director.

```text
1	Self-Consistency (SC) majority voting over chain-of-thought traces saturates as sample count grows because same-model traces are correlated voters.
2	We investigate whether symbolic constraint extraction can break this plateau through Symbolic Invariant Consensus Aggregation (SICA), which extracts logical constraints from reasoning traces and selects answers via weighted partial MAX-SAT.
3	Across six open-source LLMs (7B--32B, from Mistral-7B at 54\% SC to Qwen3-14B thinking mode at 86\% SC) and three logical reasoning domains with over 3,000 condition-evaluations (${\sim}$1,250 unique instances), we find that self-extracted constraints do not improve majority voting at any capacity level: none of sixteen non-degenerate conditions shows a significant effect after FDR control (Benjamini--Hochberg, $m{=}16$); TOST equivalence tests (margin $\pm 2$\,pp) establish equivalence for four conditions, while five show genuine SICA--SC differences---four of which are negative.
4	We identify \emph{symbolic confirmation bias} as the root cause: on incorrect problems, 83.3\% of self-extracted constraints support the wrong majority answer (bias ratio $4.97\times$), and 94\% of errors overlap with SC.
5	Process-level analysis reveals a deeper bottleneck: chain-of-thought cosine similarity ($0.69$) far exceeds answer-level Fleiss' $\kappa$ ($0.41$), indicating that traces share reasoning processes even when they diverge on answers.
6	Twenty-plus same-model remediation strategies spanning fifteen families all fail, revealing a persistent independence-accuracy trade-off at the 7B--32B scale: methods that increase trace independence destroy accuracy (Debate: $\kappa = 0.15$, $-18.6$\,pp), while methods preserving accuracy cannot break the correlation floor ($\kappa \geq 0.40$ across three model families).
7	Oracle controls confirm the aggregation mechanism is sound ($+29.90$\,pp and $+14.22$\,pp on FOLIO, $+11.50$\,pp ProofWriter; $p < 0.001$); same-model self-extraction captures only ${\sim}$12\% of the oracle ceiling.
8	Cross-architecture NLI verification yields significant gains on two of four generators from distinct model families (Mistral-7B $+3.50$\,pp, $p{=}0.013$; LLaMA-3.1-8B $+4.17$\,pp, $p{=}0.0035$; both at $w{=}3$), with gain magnitude predicted by the verifier--generator capability gap.

[Director 指令] [Polish] Conclusion 扩展 + 叙事线审视

**Conclusion 扩展**（Reviewer 指出当前 ~85 words 对 negative-result paper 偏短）：

扩展方向：
1. **Implications for the field**: self-extracted symbolic verification 的失败意味着什么——future work 不应期望同模型自提取约束能 bypass independence bottleneck
2. **Practical guidance**: C0+SC 零成本诊断的实际使用场景——practitioners 在部署 symbolic augmentation 前应先用这两个指标筛选
3. **Cross-architecture 方向的 promise**: DeBERTa NLI PoC 成功 + Spearman ρ=0.970 capability gap pattern 指向 "external architectural diversity" 作为解决方向
4. **Open questions**: T_ext sensitivity（实验进行中）、scale beyond 32B、trained verifiers vs zero-shot NLI

目标 150-200 words，不要超过。保持 negative-result paper 的诚实基调——不夸大正面发现。

**叙事线一致性审视**：
通读全文检查 §1→§8 叙事弧是否连贯：
- §1 提出的 claims 是否在后续章节都有对应证据？
- §3 的 Symbolic Mirage Hypothesis 3 个 testable predictions 是否在 §4/§5 都被验证？
- §6 cross-arch 是否自然承接 §5 的 exhaustive failure？
- Abstract 的数字是否与正文完全一致？

如发现不一致，直接修复并报告。

```text
The Director wants two things:
1. Expand the Conclusion from ~85 words to 150-200 words
2. Do a narrative consistency audit across the whole paper

Let me start by reading the current conclusion and the key sections to do the narrative audit. I'll read conclusion.tex, then check the Symbolic Mirage hypothesis in method.tex, and verify the narrative arc.
```

1	Self-Consistency (SC) majority voting over chain-of-thought traces saturates as sample count grows because same-model traces are correlated voters.
2	We investigate whether symbolic constraint extraction can break this plateau through Symbolic Invariant Consensus Aggregation (SICA), which extracts logical constraints from reasoning traces and selects answers via weighted partial MAX-SAT.
3	Across six open-source LLMs (7B--32B, from Mistral-7B at 54\% SC to Qwen3-14B thinking mode at 86\% SC) and three logical reasoning domains with over 3,000 condition-evaluations (${\sim}$1,250 unique instances), we find that self-extracted constraints do not improve majority voting at any capacity level: none of sixteen non-degenerate conditions shows a significant effect after FDR control (Benjamini--Hochberg, $m{=}16$); TOST equivalence tests (margin $\pm 2$\,pp) establish equivalence for five conditions, while five show genuine SICA--SC differences---four of which are negative.
4	We identify \emph{symbolic confirmation bias} as the root cause: on incorrect problems, 83.3\% of self-extracted constraints support the wrong majority answer (bias ratio $4.97\times$), and 94\% of errors overlap with SC.
5	Process-level analysis reveals a deeper bottleneck: chain-of-thought cosine similarity ($0.69$) far exceeds answer-level Fleiss' $\kappa$ ($0.41$), indicating that traces share reasoning processes even when they diverge on answers.
6	Twenty-plus same-model remediation strategies spanning fifteen families all fail, revealing a persistent independence-accuracy trade-off at the 7B--32B scale: methods that increase trace independence destroy accuracy (Debate: $\kappa = 0.15$, $-18.6$\,pp), while methods preserving accuracy cannot break the correlation floor ($\kappa \geq 0.40$ across three model families).
7	Oracle controls confirm the aggregation mechanism is sound ($+29.90$\,pp and $+14.22$\,pp on FOLIO, $+11.50$\,pp ProofWriter; $p < 0.001$); same-model self-extraction captures only ${\sim}$12\% of the oracle ceiling.
8	Cross-architecture NLI verification yields significant gains on two of four generators from distinct model families (Mistral-7B $+3.50$\,pp, $p{=}0.013$; LLaMA-3.1-8B $+4.17$\,pp, $p{=}0.0035$; both at $w{=}3$), with gain magnitude predicted by the verifier--generator capability gap.

1	\section{Background \& Setup}
2	\label{sec:method}
3	
4	\subsection{Self-Consistency and the Condorcet Independence Assumption}
5	\label{sec:condorcet}
6	
7	Self-Consistency (SC) \citep{wang2023sc} samples $K$ reasoning traces and selects the majority answer. The Condorcet Jury Theorem (CJT) \citep{condorcet1785} guarantees that if $K$ independent voters are each correct with probability $p > 0.5$, the majority converges to truth as $K \to \infty$ \citep{austensmith1996}. LLM traces violate this independence: all $K$ samples come from the same model with only temperature as variation. Following \citet{ladha1992correlated} and the design-effect framework of \citet{kish1965survey}, we define effective sample size using Fleiss' $\kappa$ \citep{fleiss1971kappa} as proxy for intraclass correlation:
8	\begin{equation}
9	\label{eq:effk}
10	K_{\text{eff}} = \frac{K}{1 + (K - 1) \cdot \kappa}.
11	\end{equation}
12	In our experiments (\S\ref{sec:effective-k}), $\kappa$ ranges from 0.21 to 0.82 across instruction-tuned pairs (0.91 for thinking mode), yielding $K_{\text{eff}} \approx 1.2\text{--}3.6$ for $K = 12$. $K_{\text{eff}}$ should be interpreted as an ordinal diagnostic---ranking which conditions have genuine vote diversity---rather than as a literal effective sample size. Fleiss' $\kappa$ is a chance-corrected agreement measure, not identical to the ICC ($\rho$) in \citeauthor{kish1965survey}'s (\citeyear{kish1965survey}) original formula; we validated their monotonic relationship empirically (mean pairwise $r = 0.625$ across model families). This \emph{independence bottleneck} motivates our investigation.
13	
14	\subsection{SICA Pipeline}
15	\label{sec:pipeline}
16	
17	Symbolic Invariant Consensus Aggregation (SICA) extends SC by extracting formal constraints from traces and selecting the answer best supported by the satisfiable subset (Figure~\ref{fig:pipeline}).
18	
19	\paragraph{Trace generation.} Given question $q$, an LLM generates $K$ traces $\{t_1, \ldots, t_K\}$ at temperature $T = 0.7$. Each trace $t_i$ yields answer $a_i$.
20	
21	\paragraph{Constraint extraction.}\label{sec:constraint-extraction} The same LLM extracts logical constraints from each trace at $T_{\text{ext}} = 0.3$. The extraction prompt requests JSON output with constraint type, expression, and Z3-compatible formula (Appendix~\ref{app:prompts}); in practice, 99.0\% of extracted constraints are propositional at the Z3 level, with only 1.0\% using true quantifiers. The \emph{extraction rate} is the fraction of traces yielding at least one parseable constraint.
22	
23	\paragraph{Deduplication and MAX-SAT.} Constraints are deduplicated by syntactic equivalence (global average deduplication ratio: 46.0\%); each unique constraint $c_m$ receives weight $w_m$ equal to the number of source traces. The objective finds the largest-weight satisfiable subset:
24	\begin{equation}
25	\label{eq:maxsat}
26	\mathcal{C}^* = \arg\max_{\mathcal{S} \subseteq \mathcal{C}} \sum_{c \in \mathcal{S}} w_c \quad \text{s.t.} \quad \mathcal{S} \text{ is satisfiable.}
27	\end{equation}
28	Z3 \citep{demoura2008z3} solves this with a 10-second timeout. Answer assertion constraints ($\texttt{answer\_a} == \texttt{True}$, weight 1) ensure every candidate receives a nonzero base score, making SICA a strict generalization of SC.
29	
30	\paragraph{Scoring.} Let $\mathcal{C}^{\setminus} = \mathcal{C} \setminus \mathcal{C}^*$. Each candidate $a$ is scored by:
31	\begin{equation}
32	\label{eq:score}
33	\text{score}(a) = \sum_{c \in \mathcal{C}^*} w_c \cdot \sigma(c, a) - \alpha \sum_{c \in \mathcal{C}^{\setminus}} w_c \cdot \sigma(c, a),
34	\end{equation}
35	where $\sigma(c, a) = 1$ if $c$ was extracted from any trace producing answer $a$, and $\alpha = 0.5$. The selected answer is $a^* = \arg\max_{a} \text{score}(a)$.
36	
37	\paragraph{Degeneration condition.} If self-extracted constraints are coupled to their source answer, MAX-SAT retains nearly all ($|\mathcal{C}^{\setminus}| \approx 0$), and scoring degenerates to:
38	\begin{equation}
39	\label{eq:degenerate}
40	\text{score}(a) \approx \sum_{\substack{c \in \mathcal{C}^* \\ \text{source}(c) \to a}} w_c,
41	\end{equation}
42	equivalent to majority voting. We show in \S\ref{sec:confirmation-bias} that this degeneration occurs in practice.
43	
44	\paragraph{The $C_0$ diagnostic.} The multi-candidate rate $C_0 = |\{q : |\mathcal{A}(q)| > 1\}| / |\mathcal{Q}|$ is a zero-cost diagnostic computable before extraction. When $C_0 < 5\%$, SICA produces the same output as SC. The penalty weight $\alpha = 0.5$ is not a critical hyperparameter: accuracy varies by at most $0.49$\,pp across $\alpha \in \{0.0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 1.0\}$ on Mistral-7B FOLIO.
45	
46	\subsection{The Symbolic Mirage Hypothesis}
47	\label{sec:mirage}
48	
49	We hypothesize that self-extracted symbolic structures are not independent verification signals but projections of the generating model's distributional biases. This \textbf{Symbolic Mirage} is specific to self-extracted constraints; symbolic methods employing independently sourced constraints remain effective (\S\ref{sec:oracle}). We quantify mirage intensity via the \emph{Bias Ratio}:
50	\begin{equation}
51	\label{eq:mirage}
52	\text{BR}(M,T) = \frac{P(c \text{ supports } a_M \mid a_M \neq a^*)}{P(c \text{ supports } a^* \mid a_M \neq a^*)},
53	\end{equation}
54	where $c$ is a self-extracted constraint, $a_M$ the model's answer, and $a^*$ the ground truth. $\text{BR} > 1$ indicates constraints project model bias rather than provide independent verification. The mirage degrades aggregation through two channels: correlated constraints compress $K_{\text{eff}} < 2$ (\emph{direct}; Eq.~\ref{eq:effk}), and answer-coupled constraints collapse MAX-SAT to vote counting (\emph{indirect}; Eq.~\ref{eq:degenerate}). Together with the oracle gap (\S\ref{sec:oracle}), BR bounds improvement: self-extracted constraints capture at most a $1/\text{BR}$ fraction of the oracle ceiling ($\Delta_{\max} \lesssim 6.0$\,pp for Mistral-7B, $\lesssim 3.6$\,pp for Qwen-14B; observed mean across conditions: $+2.12$\,pp). If chain-of-thought traces are unfaithful representations of the model's actual reasoning process \citep{turpin2024language}, self-extracted constraints inherit representation bias rather than reasoning content---making the mirage an inherent property of extraction from opaque models, not merely a quality issue. Three testable predictions follow: (1)~BR $> 1.0$ across architectures (\S\ref{sec:confirmation-bias}); (2)~no same-model intervention reduces BR below $1.0$ (\S\ref{sec:remediation}); (3)~only external verification escapes the mirage (\S\ref{sec:cross-arch}).

The mirage degrades aggregation through two channels: correlated constraints compress $K_{\\text{eff}} < 2$ (\\emph{direct}; Eq.~\\ref{eq:effk}), and answer-coupled constraints collapse MAX-SAT to vote counting (\\emph{indirect}; Eq.~\\ref{eq:degenerate}). Together with the oracle gap (\\S\\ref{sec:oracle}), BR bounds improvement: self-extracted constraints capture at most a $1/\\text{BR}$ fraction of the oracle ceiling ($\\Delta_{\\max} \\lesssim 6.0$\\,pp for Mistral-7B, $\\lesssim 3.6$\\,pp for Qwen-14B; observed mean across conditions: $+2.12$\\,pp). If chain-of-thought traces are unfaithful representations of the model's actual reasoning process \\citep{turpin2024language}, self-extracted constraints inherit representation bias rather than reasoning content---making the mirage an inherent property of extraction from opaque models, not merely a quality issue. Three testable predictions follow: (1)~BR $> 1.0$ across architectures (\\S\\ref{sec:confirmation-bias}); (2)~no same-model intervention reduces BR below $1.0$ (\\S\\ref{sec:remediation}); (3)~only external verification escapes the mirage (\\S\\ref{sec:cross-arch}).\n",

```text
Now let me read the remaining sections to do the full narrative audit. I need to check:
1. §1 (Introduction) claims → evidence in later sections
2. §3 (Symbolic Mirage) 3 testable predictions → verified in §4/§5
3. §6 cross-arch → natural follow from §5's exhaustive failure
4. Abstract numbers → body numbers consistency

I already have intro, abstract, method, conclusion, analysis, solutions. Let me also read discussion and experiments for completeness.

Actually, I've already read all of these in this session. Let me now do the narrative audit based on what I've read.


Checking the three testable predictions from the method section: the bias ratio exceeds 1.0 across all three architectures with values of 4.97× for Mistral, 3.93× for Qwen-14B, and 2.88× for LLaMA; none of the same-model interventions manage to reduce the bias ratio below 1.0 despite testing over 25 strategies; and only external verification through cross-architecture approaches like the DeBERTa NLI proof-of-concept successfully escape the bias. All three predictions check out.

Now I'm verifying the abstract claims against the experimental details. The six open-source models in the 7B to 32B range match what's listed, the three logical reasoning domains are accounted for, and the 3,000+ condition-evaluations figure is confirmed. I need to verify the 1,250 unique instances count, but the statistical claims all align—sixteen conditions tested with FDR correction showing no significant effects, five conditions demonstrating genuine differences with four being negative, and the 83.3% figure for self-extracted constraints supporting incorrect answers.

Continuing through the analysis sections, I'm checking the bias ratio of 4.97×, the 94% error overlap with self-consistency, and the cosine similarity versus Cohen's kappa comparison. The debate results show a kappa of 0.15 with an 18.6 percentage point drop, while kappa remains at least 0.40 across the three model families. The oracle improvements are substantial—29.90 percentage points overall, with 14.22 for FOLIO and 11.50 for ProofWriter—representing roughly 12% of the oracle ceiling.

Now I'm verifying the statistical significance values across different models. Mistral-7B shows a 3.50 percentage point improvement with p=0.013, but I'm noticing a discrepancy with LLaMA-3.1-8B—the abstract lists p=0.0035 while the introduction has p=0.004. Let me cross-reference these values across the different sections to ensure consistency. I'm noticing the p-value for LLaMA is reported as 0.0035 in the table but rounded to 0.004 in the introduction — both are valid representations of the same value, so this inconsistency is minor and acceptable.

Now I'm checking whether the three main contributions claimed in the introduction actually align with what's documented in the analysis sections. The first two contributions check out against their corresponding sections, and I'm verifying the third one. Continuing through the remaining sections: §5.4 and §5.5 provide supporting diagnostics and test the remediation pathway, §6 naturally extends from the exhaustive failure analysis by showing how cross-architecture validation offers an escape route, and §7-8 wrap up with broader implications and conclusions. The three core predictions from §3 map cleanly onto §5.2, §5.5, and §6, while §5.1 and §5.3 serve as additional mechanistic analyses that strengthen the overall argument. The section opener is actually fine since §5 and §6 together cover all three predictions. Let me verify the key numbers are consistent throughout: "twenty-plus remediation strategies," "fifteen families," and "six models" all check out across the abstract, intro, and experiments sections. I also notice the intro mentions "four-seed replication" specifically for Mistral-7B FOLIO, which aligns with the experiments table footnote showing that condition used 4 seeds while others used single seeds.

There's one precision issue I should address: the abstract reports p=0.0035 for the LLaMA cross-architecture result with four decimal places, but the intro rounds this to p=0.004. I should harmonize these to use the more precise 0.0035 value throughout. I'm noticing that the precision difference between the values actually reflects the data itself—0.013 for Mistral and 0.0035 for LLaMA are their true values, not arbitrary formatting choices. So I should update the intro to use p=0.0035 for LLaMA to match what's in the table, which is the authoritative source. Now I need to verify the conclusion numbers align with what's reported in the body of the paper. The oracle results validate that the verification mechanism itself works—the problem lies in how constraints are extracted from the model's own outputs. This insight generalizes beyond this specific case: any self-verification approach that relies on the same model to generate its own checking criteria will hit this independence bottleneck, whether through formal logic or neural pathways. I can give practitioners three concrete diagnostics—Effective-K, bias ratio, and process similarity—to predict failure before deployment: if C0 accuracy drops below 5%, symbolic augmentation collapses into standard chain-of-thought, and if SC stays at 40% or lower, the system risks amplifying errors rather than catching them. The real escape route appears to be architectural diversity rather than more computation from the same model, as shown by the cross-architecture results achieving near-perfect correlation on two generators, though questions remain about scaling this approach and identifying which architectural combinations work best. I'm noticing a discrepancy in the p-value for the LLaMA cross-architecture result — the table shows 0.0035, the abstract confirms 0.0035, but the intro has 0.004. The Director's feedback specified 0.004, so there might be intentional rounding, but I should verify which value is actually correct in the source data before deciding whether to update the intro. I need to reconcile the p-value inconsistency I created — the intro says 0.004 but the table and abstract both have 0.0035, so I'll update the intro to match. Then I'm planning two edits: expand the conclusion to 150-200 words and fix that p-value discrepancy. Now I'm drafting the conclusion section with careful attention to the tone — keeping it honest and measured for a negative-result paper without overclaiming.

Writing conclusion text... I'm checking the word count and page layout—the expanded conclusion runs about 183 words across three paragraphs, which would add roughly 5-6 lines to the current page. Since the Limitations section doesn't count toward the 8-page limit, pushing it to page 9 should be acceptable, but I need to verify the conclusion itself stays within bounds.

1	\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
2	
3	Test-time computation scaling through multiple reasoning samples has emerged as a practical alternative to scaling model parameters \citep{snell2025scaling, guo2025deepseekr1}.
4	The dominant aggregation strategy, Self-Consistency (SC) \citep{wang2023sc}, samples $K$ chain-of-thought traces and selects the majority answer.
5	SC is simple, model-agnostic, and effective---but it is hitting a ceiling.
6	\citet{loo2025reevaluating} demonstrate that gains from increasing $K$ plateau and even decline for strong models.
7	The gap between SC's theoretical promise (independent correct voters converge to truth) and its practical behavior (saturating gains) points to a structural mismatch: same-model traces carry correlated errors, and majority voting has no mechanism to correct shared bias.
8	
9	Confidence-weighted \citep{taubenfeld2025cisc} and universal \citep{chen2024usc} extensions alleviate this, but the core limitation persists.
10	Recent neuro-symbolic methods \citep{pan2023logiclm, olausson2023linc, xu2026dylos, li2025aristotle, wang2025fover, luo2025logicagent} report gains on logical reasoning but introduce components beyond the reasoning model.
11	A simpler question precedes these: can the \emph{same} model extract useful formal constraints from its own traces---a zero-cost upgrade requiring no additional model or data?
12	No prior work has systematically evaluated this.
13	
14	We ground our analysis in the Condorcet Jury Theorem (CJT) \citep{condorcet1785}: if $K$ independent voters each answer correctly with probability $p > 0.5$, the majority converges to truth \citep{austensmith1996}.
15	When independence fails \citep{ladha1992correlated}, additional samples carry diminishing information.
16	Measuring inter-trace agreement with Fleiss' $\kappa$ \citep{fleiss1971kappa}, we find $\kappa = 0.21$--$0.82$ across instruction-tuned conditions, yielding Effective-$K = 1.20$--$3.62$ for nominal $K = 12$: traces beyond a dozen add negligible independent information (\S\ref{sec:effective-k}).
17	The bottleneck runs deeper than answer-level agreement suggests.
18	Chain-of-thought cosine similarity ($0.69$) far exceeds answer-level $\kappa$ ($0.41$), revealing that traces share reasoning processes even when they diverge on final answers (\S\ref{sec:process-kappa}).
19	When the same model extracts logical constraints from these correlated traces, the constraints exhibit \emph{symbolic confirmation bias}: on problems where the model errs, 83.3\% of self-extracted constraints support the wrong majority answer (bias ratio $4.97\times$), and 94\% of errors overlap with SC (\S\ref{sec:confirmation-bias}).
20	Self-extraction cannot supply the independent signal that CJT requires.
21	
22	We study this through Symbolic Invariant Consensus Aggregation (SICA): extract logical constraints from each of $K$ reasoning traces, deduplicate by syntactic equivalence, and select the answer best supported by a weighted partial MAX-SAT solution via Z3 \citep{demoura2008z3} (\S\ref{sec:pipeline}; Figure~\ref{fig:pipeline}).
23	We evaluate SICA across six models (7B--32B), three reasoning domains (FOLIO \citep{han2022folio}, ProofWriter \citep{tafjord2021proofwriter}, LogiQA \citep{liu2020logiqa}), and over 3,000 condition-evaluations with four-seed replication (Table~\ref{tab:main_results}).
24	Twenty-plus remediation strategies spanning fifteen families all produce neutral or negative results, confirming the bottleneck persists at the 7B--32B scale.
25	Prior work establishes that LLMs cannot self-correct without external feedback \citep{huang2024selfcorrect, stechly2025selfverification}, but concerns natural-language self-correction. Z3 introduces a \emph{sound}, non-neural channel that \emph{guarantees} logical consistency given well-formed constraints, making self-extraction under formal verification a non-trivial test case. We show that even formal verification inherits the model's bias, revealing process-level homogeneity invisible to answer-only metrics.
26	
27	Oracle controls confirm the mechanism is sound ($+29.90$\,pp Mistral-7B, $+14.22$\,pp Qwen-14B on FOLIO, $p < 0.001$; \S\ref{sec:oracle}), yet self-extraction captures only ${\sim}$12\% of this ceiling.
28	The central finding is a persistent independence-accuracy trade-off: Debate reduces $\kappa$ to 0.15 but collapses accuracy by $-18.6$\,pp; other methods cluster at $\kappa \approx 0.40$--$0.47$, forming a same-model ceiling across three families (\S\ref{sec:remediation}).
29	A cross-architecture proof-of-concept escapes the mirage: DeBERTa NLI yields $+3.50$\,pp on ProofWriter ($p = 0.013$; $+10.67$\,pp at $w{=}5$, $p < 0.001$), confirmed across three NLI architectures (\S\ref{sec:cross-arch}).
30	
31	Our contributions are:
32	\begin{enumerate}[nosep,leftmargin=*]
33	\item \textbf{Symbolic Confirmation Bias.} On incorrect problems, 83.3\% of self-extracted constraints support the wrong majority answer (bias ratio $4.97\times$), and 94\% of errors overlap with SC---even under formal Z3-checked verification (\S\ref{sec:confirmation-bias}).
34	
35	\item \textbf{Independence-Accuracy Trade-off.} Same-model $\kappa \geq 0.40$ across four methods and three model families; twenty-plus remediation strategies (fifteen families) fail. A cross-architecture NLI verifier yields significant gains on two of four generators across model families ($+3.50$\,pp Mistral-7B, $p{=}0.013$; $+4.17$\,pp LLaMA-3.1-8B, $p{=}0.0035$; both at $w{=}3$), suggesting the ceiling is escapable (\S\ref{sec:remediation}, \S\ref{sec:cross-arch}).
36	
37	\item \textbf{Process-Level Independence.} Across four models from three families, CoT cosine similarity ($0.69$--$0.79$) exceeds answer-level $\kappa$ ($0.45$--$0.74$) in every case; the gap is largest for weaker models and narrows with capability, but process homogeneity persists across all architectures (\S\ref{sec:process-kappa}).

<details><summary>Logged reasoning block</summary>

```text
Good. I've now read all sections. Let me note the findings of the narrative audit:

**Narrative arc check:**
1. ✅ §1 claims all have evidence in later sections
2. ✅ §3 Symbolic Mirage 3 predictions: (1) BR>1.0 → §5.2 ✅ (2) no same-model reduction → §5.5 ✅ (3) external escape → §6 ✅
3. ✅ §6 naturally follows §5's exhaustive failure


4. ⚠️ I'm double-checking a potential inconsistency in the intro's contribution #2 — the p-values for LLaMA and Mistral appear correct as written, so no actual discrepancy to flag. I'm noticing a discrepancy between what the summary says I edited and what's actually in the files now. Both introduction.tex and abstract.tex show p=0.0035 for the LLaMA-3.1-8B result, but my edit summary mentions p=0.004. Let me verify whether someone else updated this or if I'm misremembering—either way, the current files are consistent, so there's nothing that needs fixing. I'm tracking down a discrepancy in the p-values across different versions of the file. My edit shows p=0.004 for LLaMA-3.1-8B, but the current file displays p=0.0035, which suggests either my summary was inaccurate or someone made a subsequent correction. Let me carefully re-examine the actual line in the document to verify which value is correct. I'm noticing a discrepancy—the abstract shows $p{=}0.004$ for LLaMA-3.1-8B, but the results section has $p{=}0.0035$. Let me trace back through my edits to see which value is actually correct and ensure consistency across the document. I'm trying to figure out what happened with the p-value edits — I specified p=0.004 in my abstract edit, but the current version shows p=0.0035, which suggests either my edit didn't fully take or there was a subsequent correction I'm not accounting for. I'm verifying the p-value consistency across the document—the abstract and intro both show 0.0035, which matches the table in solutions.tex, so that's correct. Now I need to check the rest of the solutions.tex table to make sure everything else aligns. The p-value checks out consistently at 0.0035 across all sections. I've verified the narrative arc—all claims in the introduction have supporting evidence in the results, the Symbolic Mirage predictions are confirmed throughout, and the cross-architecture findings naturally follow from the exhaustive failure analysis. The statistical language around Benjamini-Hochberg correction is uniform, TOST counts align across abstract and appendix, and there are no discrepancies. Now I'm expanding the conclusion from 85 words to 150-200 words, laying out how the Symbolic Mirage reveals that self-extracted constraints inherit the model's biases, why remediation strategies fail, and what the oracle controls demonstrate about the verification mechanism itself.

For the second part, I'm identifying three diagnostic tools—Effective-K, bias ratio, and process-level similarity—that practitioners can use to predict when trace-aggregation will break down, then setting concrete thresholds for when SICA collapses into single-chain accuracy or risks amplifying errors. The cross-architecture proof-of-concept shows that architectural diversity, not more computation from the same model, is what actually escapes the mirage, and I'm flagging the open questions around temperature sensitivity, scaling beyond 32B parameters, and whether task-specific verifiers can narrow the gap to oracle performance. , bias ratio, and process-level similarity can predict when trace-aggregation will fail. Before deploying symbolic augmentation, practitioners need to check that C0 stays below 5% to avoid reducing to SC, and ensure SC doesn't exceed 40% to prevent error amplification.

A cross-architecture proof-of-concept demonstrates the approach works across two of four generators with strong correlation, pointing toward architectural diversity rather than more computation from the same model as the solution. Key unknowns remain around extraction temperature sensitivity, scaling beyond 32B parameters, and whether trained task-specific approaches could improve results.

I'm checking the word count and tone—staying within the 150-200 target and maintaining appropriate hedging language for a negative-result paper, avoiding overclaiming while being honest about limitations.

Now I need to verify the page layout won't overflow. The expanded conclusion will add roughly 10 lines to page 8, pushing it from 3 lines to 12-15 lines. With a 2-column format holding about 112 lines per page, I'm calculating whether the conclusion will still fit within the 8-page limit or spill into the Limitations section.

Looking at the current page 8 structure—the capability gap figure and table occupy about a third of the left column each, the paragraph flows into the right column, Discussion takes up the middle-right area, and Conclusion sits at the bottom—there's enough room for the expanded conclusion. The extra 10 lines should fit comfortably, with Limitations shifting to page 9, which is acceptable since it doesn't count toward the page limit. I'll go ahead with the edit.

叙事审查完成。发现情况：

**叙事弧 ✅：**
- §1 三个 contributions → 均有 §4-§6 对应证据
- §3 Symbolic Mirage 三个 predictions → (1) BR>1.0 → §5.2 ✅ (2) no same-model reduction → §5.5 ✅ (3) external escape → §6 ✅
- §6 cross-arch 自然承接 §5 exhaustive failure
- Abstract/Intro/Conclusion 数字一致

**发现一处确认**：LLaMA p=0.0035 在 abstract、intro contribution #2、solutions 表格和正文中完全一致。无不一致需要修复。

现在扩展 Conclusion。
