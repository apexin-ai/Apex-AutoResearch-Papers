```text
670	We categorize discordant predictions (where the method and SC disagree) for Debate and Contrastive on FOLIO ($n = 204$) to understand why these interventions degrade accuracy.
671	
672	\paragraph{Debate discordant analysis.} Debate produces 60 correct$\to$wrong flips and 22 wrong$\to$correct flips on FOLIO. Answer-type breakdown reveals that False-labeled questions are most vulnerable: 82.8\% of False questions that SC answers correctly are flipped by Debate, compared to 63.9\% for True and 25.5\% for Unknown. Counterintuitively, failures concentrate not where debate breaks down but where it succeeds most thoroughly: discordant questions average 2.93 effective debate rounds (proposer-critic exchanges producing substantive updates) versus 2.52 for concordant ones. More extensive same-model debate produces more confident but incorrect constraints, consistent with the independence bottleneck---the critic draws on the same model distribution as the proposer, reinforcing shared biases rather than correcting them.
673	
674	\paragraph{Contrastive discordant analysis.} Contrastive produces 34 discordant questions on FOLIO. All 34 produced non-degenerate scores (both pro and con constraint sets non-empty), compared to 20.1\% degenerate scores in the full sample. This indicates that scoring failures on discordant questions stem from systematic pro-bias rather than missing constraints. Among discordant questions, 97.1\% contain negation words in the problem statement versus 76.5\% in the full sample, suggesting that negation-bearing problems are particularly susceptible to pro-constraint imbalance. The average pro/con score ratio is 1.0 for discordant questions versus 0.68 for the full sample: the method generates balanced-looking scores that mask directional errors.
675	
676	\paragraph{Cross-method overlap.} Of the 79 unique questions on which either method disagrees with SC, only 15 overlap between Debate and Contrastive (Jaccard index $= 0.19$). All 15 shared discordant questions contain negation words. The low overlap confirms that the two methods attack different vulnerability types---Debate through extended same-model argumentation that amplifies confident errors, Contrastive through pro-bias in constraint generation---while sharing a common root cause in the independence bottleneck: both methods rely on the same model's output distribution and cannot introduce genuinely independent signal.
677	
678	
679	\section{TOST Equivalence Tests}
680	\label{app:tost}
681	
682	We apply two one-sided tests (TOST) \citep{lakens2017equivalence} with equivalence margin $\pm 2$\,pp to all 15 non-degenerate SICA--SC comparisons. Four conditions fall within the equivalence bounds (Qwen2.5-7B FOLIO, Qwen2.5-14B FOLIO, Mistral-7B LogiQA, Qwen3-14B PW-D5), confirming that SICA and SC produce statistically equivalent accuracy. Five conditions show genuine differences outside the equivalence margin: four are negative (PW-D5 Mistral $-2.83$\,pp, PW-D5 Qwen-14B $-2.50$\,pp, FOLIO LLaMA $-4.41$\,pp, FOLIO Qwen3 $-0.49$\,pp with tight CI) and one is positive but non-significant (Mistral FOLIO $+3.43$\,pp, $p = 0.092$). The remaining six conditions are underpowered: the equivalence test is inconclusive and the superiority test is also non-significant, leaving these conditions in an indeterminate zone.

Now I have the current state:

1. **appendix.tex line 682**: Says "15 non-degenerate" and "Four conditions" for equivalence. Need to update to "16" and "Five conditions", adding Qwen3-14B (think) FOLIO.

2. **experiments.tex line 66**: Says "4 conditions" for TOST equivalence. Need to update to "5 conditions".

Let me compute the TOST for Qwen3-14B (think) FOLIO:
- n = 204
- SC = 86.27% → 176/204


- SICA = 86.76% → 177/204

Looking at the actual data from Table 1, I need to verify these values match what's recorded for Qwen3-14B (think) FOLIO with b=1 (SICA+ SC-) and c=0 (SICA- SC+).

The McNemar test p-value of 1.000 makes sense given b=1 and c=0 — with only one discordant pair, the binomial test yields p=1.0, indicating no significant difference between the two methods despite the 0.49 percentage point improvement. For the two-sided test with b+c=1, McNemar's exact test gives a p-value of 1.0 since P(X≥1) = 0.5 for X ~ Binomial(1, 0.5).

For TOST with a ±2 percentage point margin, I'm calculating the z-statistics for both one-sided tests: the first test checks if the difference exceeds -2pp (z₁ ≈ 5.08, p ≈ 0) and the second checks if it stays below +2pp (z₂ ≈ -3.08, p ≈ 0.001). Both reject their null hypotheses, so equivalence is established. Now I'm ready to make the edits.

I need to update ix.tex line 682 to change "15 non-degenerate" to "16 non-degenerate" and "Four conditions" to "Five conditions", plus add Qwen3-14B (think) FOLIO to the equivalence list. For experiments.tex line 66, I'm changing "4 conditions" to "5 conditions" to match the updated count.

Beyond accuracy comparisons, we conduct diagnostic analyses of symbolic confirmation bias and process-level trace independence (\\S\\ref{sec:analysis}).\n\n\\paragraph{Models.} Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct, Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, Qwen3-14B (non-thinking mode)~\\citep{yang2024qwen25}, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3~\\citep{jiang2023mistral}, LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct~\\citep{dubey2024llama3}, and QwQ-32B~\\citep{qwen2024qwq} (7B--32B parameters).\n\n\\paragraph{Datasets.} FOLIO~\\citep{han2022folio} ($n{=}204$, with gold logical annotations), ProofWriter depth-5~\\citep{tafjord2021proofwriter} ($n{=}600$), LogiQA~\\citep{liu2020logiqa} ($n{=}200$). StrategyQA~\\citep{geva2021strategyqa} ($n{=}200$) serves as a domain-formalizability diagnostic. GSM8K~\\citep{cobbe2021gsm8k} ($n{=}30$) and AIME 2024 ($n{=}22$) probe the degenerate regime ($C_0 < 5\\%$).\n\n\\paragraph{Parameters.} $K{=}12$ traces at $T{=}0.7$; extraction at $T_{\\text{ext}}{=}0.3$. Z3 timeout: 10s. $\\alpha{=}0.5$. Statistical significance via McNemar exact test ($\\alpha{=}0.05$); 95\\% bootstrap CIs from 10,000 resamples for $n \\geq 200$.\n\n\\paragraph{Computational cost.} On Mistral-7B FOLIO ($K{=}12$), SICA takes $4.5{\\times}$ SC wall-clock time; constraint extraction ($K$ additional LLM calls) accounts for 76\\% of overhead, Z3 solving is negligible (${<}0.1\\%$).\n\n\n\\subsection{Main Results}\n\\label{sec:main-results}\n\nTable~\\ref{tab:main_results} reports accuracy across all conditions sorted by SC baseline.

682	We apply two one-sided tests (TOST) \citep{lakens2017equivalence} with equivalence margin $\pm 2$\,pp to all 16 non-degenerate SICA--SC comparisons. Five conditions fall within the equivalence bounds (Qwen2.5-7B FOLIO, Qwen2.5-14B FOLIO, Mistral-7B LogiQA, Qwen3-14B PW-D5, Qwen3-14B (think) FOLIO), confirming that SICA and SC produce statistically equivalent accuracy. Five conditions show genuine differences outside the equivalence margin: four are negative (PW-D5 Mistral $-2.83$\,pp, PW-D5 Qwen-14B $-2.50$\,pp, FOLIO LLaMA $-4.41$\,pp, FOLIO Qwen3 $-0.49$\,pp with tight CI) and one is positive but non-significant (Mistral FOLIO $+3.43$\,pp, $p = 0.092$). The remaining six conditions are underpowered: the equivalence test is inconclusive and the superiority test is also non-significant, leaving these conditions in an indeterminate zone.

    "content": "- update-config: Use this skill to configure the Claude Code harness via settings.json. Automated behaviors (\"from now on when X\", \"each time X\", \"whenever X\", \"before/after X\") require hooks configured in settings.json - the harness executes these, not Claude, so memory/preferences cannot fulfill them. Also use for: permissions (\"allow X\", \"add permission\", \"move permission to\"), env vars (\"set X=Y\"), hook troubleshooting, or any changes to settings.json/settings.local.json files. Examples: \"allow npm commands\", \"add bq permission to global settings\", \"move permission to user settings\", \"set DEBUG=true\", \"when claude stops show X\". For simple settings like theme/model, suggest the /config command.\n- keybindings-help: Use when the user wants to customize keyboard shortcuts, rebind keys, add chord bindings, or modify ~/.claude/keybindings.json. Examples: \"rebind ctrl+s\", \"add a chord shortcut\", \"change the submit key\", \"customize keybindings\".\n- simplify: Review changed code for reuse, quality, and efficiency, then fix any issues found.\n- fewer-permission-prompts: Scan your transcripts for common read-only Bash and MCP tool calls, then add a prioritized allowlist to project .claude/settings.json to reduce permission prompts.\n- loop: Run a prompt or slash command on a recurring interval (e.g. /loop 5m /foo). Omit the interval to let the model self-pace. - When the user wants to set up a recurring task, poll for status, or run something repeatedly on an interval (e.g. \"check the deploy every 5 minutes\", \"keep running /babysit-prs\"). Do NOT invoke for one-off tasks.\n- schedule: Create, update, list, or run scheduled remote agents (routines) that execute on a cron schedule. - When the user wants to schedule a recurring remote agent, set up automated tasks, create a cron job for Claude Code, or manage their scheduled agents/routines. Also use when the user wants a one-time scheduled run (\"run this once at 3pm\", \"remind me to check X tomorrow\").\n- claude-api: Build, debug, and optimize Claude API / Anthropic SDK apps. Apps built with this skill should include prompt caching. Also handles migrating existing Claude API code between Claude model versions (4.5 → 4.6, 4.6 → 4.7, retired-model replacements).\nTRIGGER when: code imports `anthropic`/`@anthropic-ai/sdk`; user asks for the Claude API, Anthropic SDK, or Managed Agents; user adds/modifies/tunes a Claude feature (caching, thinking, compaction, tool use, batch, files, citations, memory) or model (Opus/Sonnet/Haiku) in a file; questions about prompt caching / cache hit rate in an Anthropic SDK project.\nSKIP: file imports `openai`/other-provider SDK, filename like `*-openai.py`/`*-generic.py`, provider-neutral code, general programming/ML.\n- init: Initialize a new CLAUDE.md file with codebase documentation\n- review: Review a pull request\n- security-review: Complete a security review of the pending changes on the current branch",

```text
The T_ext ablation worker has finished, but its result says the experiment is still running on the server (PID 452128) and will take ~6 hours total. The worker set it up and started it, then reported back. The actual experiment is running on westd-25068.

Key info from the worker:
- T_ext ablation running on westd-25068 (PID 452128)
- T_ext=0.1 started processing, each T_ext takes ~89 min, 4 values total → ~6 hours
- T_ext=0.3 baseline already available from exp033: SC=54.41%, SICA=59.31%, Δ=+4.9pp


- Results will be saved to `/root/symb_invariant_consensus/results/text_ablation_results.json`

I'm noticing the SC baseline shows 54.41%, which is the old pre-tiebreaking value—it should be 55.88% with alphabetical tiebreaking applied. Though actually, since the T_ext ablation varies extraction temperature while keeping the same traces, SC shouldn't change across different T_ext values anyway since it's computed from the trace data itself, not the extraction temperature.

The experiment is running as a long background process on the server and will take around 6 hours to complete. I should update the Director on the setup and consider monitoring it with a cron job.

```text
I need to register a cron to monitor the T_ext ablation experiment. Let me use the info from the worker:
- Server: westd-25068
- PID: 452128
- Log path: /root/symb_invariant_consensus/results/text_ablation.log

But first I need an exp_id in the registry. Let me check if this experiment was registered. The worker was an analysis worker, not a training experiment, so it might not have an exp_id in the registry. Let me check.

Actually, the worker task_type was "analysis:text-ablation-folio" - this is an analysis task, not a registered experiment. 

I should check the registry first to see if there's already an entry I can use, or if I need to create one.

2. 用 SC=55.88% 作为基线计算 5 个 T_ext 的 Δpp + McNemar p
3. 汇总结果表报 Director

[Director 指令] **两个快速任务**：

1. **Missing images 排查**：Reviewer 发现 appendix 引用了 `f2_regime_scatter` 和 `f3_k_sensitivity` 两个图文件但编译目录中不存在。请检查：
   - 这些文件是否在远程服务器 `/root/symb_invariant_consensus/` 上？
   - 还是 appendix 中的引用路径错误？
   - 如果文件存在于远程，同步到本地 `docs/paper/figures/`
   - 如果文件不存在，确认 appendix 中引用这些图的 `\includegraphics` 是否需要注释掉或更新路径

2. **LLaMA p-value 精度统一**：abstract.tex 和 introduction.tex 的 LLaMA p=0.004，但 solutions.tex 表格/正文用 p=0.0035。请将 abstract 和 intro 统一为 p=0.0035（更精确）。编译确认。

Two tasks, both can be done in parallel:

1. Missing images - need to check appendix.tex for references to these figures, and check local figures directory
2. LLaMA p-value - need to find and fix in abstract.tex and introduction.tex

Let me start by searching for these references and reading the relevant files.

Task 1: Both files exist in `figures/` directory - `f2_regime_scatter.pdf` and `f3_k_sensitivity.pdf` are present. The log shows they are successfully used in compilation. This is a false alarm from the reviewer, or they were looking at a stale build. The files exist and compile fine.

Task 2: The grep for p=0.004 and p=0.0035 only found a match in `limitations_content.tex`. Let me search more broadly.

Task 1 resolved: both `f2_regime_scatter.pdf` and `f3_k_sensitivity.pdf` **exist** in `docs/paper/figures/` and compile successfully. No action needed.

Task 2: p-value grep only found `limitations_content.tex`. Let me search more broadly.

6	Twenty-plus same-model remediation strategies spanning fifteen families all fail, revealing a persistent independence-accuracy trade-off at the 7B--32B scale: methods that increase trace independence destroy accuracy (Debate: $\kappa = 0.15$, $-18.6$\,pp), while methods preserving accuracy cannot break the correlation floor ($\kappa \geq 0.40$ across three model families).
7	Oracle controls confirm the aggregation mechanism is sound ($+29.90$\,pp and $+14.22$\,pp on FOLIO, $+11.50$\,pp ProofWriter; $p < 0.001$); same-model self-extraction captures only ${\sim}$12\% of the oracle ceiling.

Z3 introduces a \\emph{sound}, non-neural channel that \\emph{guarantees} logical consistency given well-formed constraints, making self-extraction under formal verification a non-trivial test case. We show that even formal verification inherits the model's bias, revealing process-level homogeneity invisible to answer-only metrics.\n\nOracle controls confirm the mechanism is sound ($+29.90$\\,pp Mistral-7B, $+14.22$\\,pp Qwen-14B on FOLIO, $p < 0.001$; \\S\\ref{sec:oracle}), yet self-extraction captures only ${\\sim}$12\\% of this ceiling.\nThe central finding is a persistent independence-accuracy trade-off: Debate reduces $\\kappa$ to 0.15 but collapses accuracy by $-18.6$\\,pp; other methods cluster at $\\kappa \\approx 0.40$--$0.47$, forming a same-model ceiling across three families (\\S\\ref{sec:remediation}).\nA cross-architecture proof-of-concept escapes the mirage: DeBERTa NLI yields $+3.50$\\,pp on ProofWriter ($p = 0.013$; $+10.67$\\,pp at $w{=}5$, $p < 0.001$), confirmed across three NLI architectures (\\S\\ref{sec:cross-arch}).\n\nOur contributions are:\n\\begin{enumerate}[nosep,leftmargin=*]\n\\item \\textbf{Symbolic Confirmation Bias.} On incorrect problems, 83.3\\% of self-extracted constraints support the wrong majority answer (bias ratio $4.97\\times$), and 94\\% of errors overlap with SC---even under formal Z3-checked verification (\\S\\ref{sec:confirmation-bias}).\n\n\\item \\textbf{Independence-Accuracy Trade-off.} Same-model $\\kappa \\geq 0.40$ across four methods and three model families; twenty-plus remediation strategies (fifteen families) fail.

1	\paragraph{Scale and language.}
2	All models range from 7B to 32B parameters; whether the independence bottleneck persists at larger scales (70B+) or with reasoning-specialized models is untested. All datasets are English-language logical reasoning benchmarks with discrete answer spaces. We do not evaluate trained symbolic extractors, external solvers with verified grounding, or multilingual settings. Oracle analysis is limited to FOLIO and ProofWriter (gold annotations available); extending to commonsense reasoning requires constructing comparable gold constraint sets. The cross-architecture NLI verifier (\S\ref{sec:cross-arch}) provides no benefit on LogiQA (combo $\Delta \leq +1$\,pp, all $p > 0.5$), indicating that cross-architecture escape requires task-verifier alignment---NLI is effective only when the task naturally decomposes into premise-conclusion entailment. Even on compatible tasks, NLI gain vanishes when the capability gap is large (Qwen3-14B ProofWriter: SC 85\% vs.\ DeBERTa 55\%, gap $= -30$\,pp, $\Delta \leq +1.00$\,pp, n.s.), though moderate negative gaps still yield significant gains (LLaMA-3.1-8B: gap $= -15$\,pp, $+4.17$\,pp, $p = 0.004$; \S\ref{sec:cross-arch}). Scaling the cross-architecture approach---via trained verifiers, code-based symbolic execution, or multi-verifier ensembles---remains unexplored and may extend the escape to stronger generators and broader task types.
3	
4	\paragraph{Statistical power.}
5	The per-label complementarity analysis of the cross-architecture NLI result (\S\ref{sec:cross-arch}) involves small cell sizes (e.g., 42 \textsc{False} problems, 69 \textsc{Unknown} problems); per-label McNemar tests would be underpowered. The bias ratio metric ($4.97\times$) was initially computed on a single condition (Mistral-7B FOLIO, $n = 204$); cross-model replication (Table~\ref{tab:cross-model-bias}) confirms the pattern but is limited to FOLIO. Four-seed replication shows 2 of 4 seeds yielding null or negative results, and the intermediate-SC region is narrow (SC $\approx$ 50--55\%). The process-level similarity metric uses TF-IDF representations (a lower bound on true process similarity). Pairwise Pearson $r$ between traces (mean $0.625$, Mistral-7B) is monotonically related to Fleiss' $\kappa$ across all four model families, supporting $\kappa$ as a valid consensus proxy despite the simplifying assumptions of Eq.~\ref{eq:effk}.
6	
7	\paragraph{Computational cost trade-off.}
8	SICA requires $4.5\times$ the wall-clock time of SC (81.4 vs.\ 17.7\,min for 204 questions at $K{=}12$), with constraint extraction accounting for 76\% of overhead (\S\ref{sec:exp-setup}). This $3.5\times$ additional cost yields no significant accuracy gain on any condition, making the method impractical in its current form. Alternative prompting strategies (few-shot, chain-of-thought extraction) might improve extraction quality, though the oracle gap suggests the bottleneck is structural. Additional limitations regarding power analysis and deduplication strategy are discussed in Appendix~\ref{app:limitations-extended}.
9	
10	\paragraph{Reproducibility.} All code, data, and experimental scripts will be released upon publication to facilitate replication of SICA, the oracle controls, and all remediation experiments.

This says `$p < 0.004$` in appendix.tex:715, referring to "Two of four generators...show significant improvement ($p < 0.004$)". This is a different usage - it's saying both p-values are below 0.004, which is correct since Mistral p=0.013 and LLaMA p=0.0035... wait, no. Mistral p=0.013 is NOT < 0.004. 


Looking more closely at the data, Mistral's p-value of 0.013 doesn't satisfy the threshold of 0.004, but LLaMA's 0.0035 does. So the statement "$p < 0.004$" seems inaccurate unless it's referring to a corrected p-value or should be adjusted to something like $p < 0.014$ to capture both results.

The Director's instructions focused on unifying the abstract and introduction to 0.0035, so this discrepancy in the appendix falls outside that scope. I should note this inconsistency in my report but recognize it wasn't part of the primary directive. Let me check whether the BH correction at m=12 might explain the threshold being used here.

Appendix line 715 has `$p < 0.004$` in a different context — "Two of four generators show significant improvement ($p < 0.004$)". This appears to be an error since Mistral's p=0.013 is NOT < 0.004. I'll flag this to Director but won't change it since it wasn't in scope. Let me compile now.

[Director 指令] 修正 appendix.tex:715 的 p-value 错误。

当前："Two of four generators show significant improvement ($p < 0.004$), both surviving BH correction at $m{=}12$"

Mistral-7B raw p=0.013（不满足 p<0.004），LLaMA raw p=0.0035。

改为：
"Two of four generators show significant improvement after BH correction ($m{=}12$): LLaMA-3.1-8B ($p=0.0035$, adj.\ $p < 0.001$) and Mistral-7B ($p=0.013$, adj.\ $p=0.038$)"

编译确认。

715	Table~\ref{tab:cross_generator_nli} reports the controlled cross-generator comparison with a fixed DeBERTa-large-mnli verifier (55.00\% standalone) on ProofWriter ($n{=}600$), spanning four generators from three model families. Figure~\ref{fig:capability-gap} plots these four generators alongside FOLIO conditions and two additional NLI architectures (RoBERTa-MNLI, BART-MNLI on Mistral-7B ProofWriter) at $w{=}3$. Across all eight ProofWriter conditions spanning three NLI architectures and four generators from three families, Spearman $\rho = 0.970$ ($p < 0.001$). Sigmoid and linear fits yield similar adjusted $R^2$ ($0.781$ vs.\ $0.752$; $\Delta = 0.029$; linear slope $= 0.143$ [95\% CI: $0.076$, $0.209$]), indicating that the monotonic trend is robust but the specific functional form is underdetermined with four generators. Restricting to the six DeBERTa-MNLI conditions across both datasets (excluding LLaMA-3.1-8B) yields $\rho = 0.928$ ($p < 0.01$; linear $R^2 = 0.888$, $p = 0.005$). Both analyses converge on the same pattern: significant NLI escape for generators with moderate capability gaps, plateauing for strong generators. Two of four generators---from distinct model families---show significant improvement ($p < 0.004$), both surviving Benjamini--Hochberg correction at $m{=}12$. RoBERTa-MNLI and BART-MNLI are shown in the figure for cross-verifier confirmation.

[Director 指令] **全文数字一致性 final pass**

通读以下 tex 文件，交叉验证所有出现的数字（accuracy、Δpp、p-value、n、κ、Eff-K、BR 等）是否跨文件一致：

检查文件：abstract.tex, introduction.tex, experiments.tex, analysis.tex, solutions.tex, discussion.tex, conclusion.tex, limitations_content.tex, appendix.tex

重点检查：
1. **p-value 精度**：所有 LLaMA p 应为 0.0035（不是 0.004）；所有 Mistral PW p 应为 0.014（raw）+ BH adj 0.112
2. **w=3 vs w=5**：所有 headline 数字用 w=3（Mistral +3.50pp, LLaMA +4.17pp）；w=5 数字仅在标注 w=5 的上下文中出现
3. **TOST 计数**：全文应为 5/5/6（不是 4/5/6）
4. **BH 校正**：Table 1 degradation 不再称 "significant"，所有 p=0.014 处有 BH adj 注释
5. **SC baseline**：55.88%（corrected），54.41% 仅在标注 pre-tiebreaking 或 per-seed 的上下文
6. **DeBERTa standalone**：55.00%（不是 36% 或其他）
7. **"27" remediation**：全文一致
8. **Spearman ρ=0.970**：appendix + abstract + solutions 一致

列出所有发现的不一致，不要自行修改（先报告给我确认）。

1	Self-Consistency (SC) majority voting over chain-of-thought traces saturates as sample count grows because same-model traces are correlated voters.
2	We investigate whether symbolic constraint extraction can break this plateau through Symbolic Invariant Consensus Aggregation (SICA), which extracts logical constraints from reasoning traces and selects answers via weighted partial MAX-SAT.
3	Across six open-source LLMs (7B--32B, from Mistral-7B at 54\% SC to Qwen3-14B thinking mode at 86\% SC) and three logical reasoning domains with over 3,000 condition-evaluations (${\sim}$1,250 unique instances), we find that self-extracted constraints do not improve majority voting at any capacity level: none of sixteen non-degenerate conditions shows a significant effect after FDR control (Benjamini--Hochberg, $m{=}16$); TOST equivalence tests (margin $\pm 2$\,pp) establish equivalence for five conditions, while five show genuine SICA--SC differences---four of which are negative.
4	We identify \emph{symbolic confirmation bias} as the root cause: on incorrect problems, 83.3\% of self-extracted constraints support the wrong majority answer (bias ratio $4.97\times$), and 94\% of errors overlap with SC.
5	Process-level analysis reveals a deeper bottleneck: chain-of-thought cosine similarity ($0.69$) far exceeds answer-level Fleiss' $\kappa$ ($0.41$), indicating that traces share reasoning processes even when they diverge on answers.
6	Twenty-seven same-model remediation strategies spanning fifteen families all fail, revealing a persistent independence-accuracy trade-off at the 7B--32B scale: methods that increase trace independence destroy accuracy (Debate: $\kappa = 0.15$, $-18.6$\,pp), while methods preserving accuracy cannot break the correlation floor ($\kappa \geq 0.40$ across three model families).
7	Oracle controls confirm the aggregation mechanism is sound ($+29.90$\,pp and $+14.22$\,pp on FOLIO, $+11.50$\,pp ProofWriter; $p < 0.001$); same-model self-extraction captures only ${\sim}$12\% of the oracle ceiling.
8	Cross-architecture NLI verification yields significant gains on two of four generators from distinct model families (Mistral-7B $+3.50$\,pp, $p{=}0.013$; LLaMA-3.1-8B $+4.17$\,pp, $p{=}0.0035$; both at $w{=}3$), with gain magnitude predicted by the verifier--generator capability gap (Spearman $\rho = 0.970$, $p < 0.001$).

1	\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
2	
3	Test-time computation scaling through multiple reasoning samples has emerged as a practical alternative to scaling model parameters \citep{snell2025scaling, guo2025deepseekr1}.
4	The dominant aggregation strategy, Self-Consistency (SC) \citep{wang2023sc}, samples $K$ chain-of-thought traces and selects the majority answer.
5	SC is simple, model-agnostic, and effective---but it is hitting a ceiling.
6	\citet{loo2025reevaluating} demonstrate that gains from increasing $K$ plateau and even decline for strong models.
7	The gap between SC's theoretical promise (independent correct voters converge to truth) and its practical behavior (saturating gains) points to a structural mismatch: same-model traces carry correlated errors, and majority voting has no mechanism to correct shared bias.
8	
9	Confidence-weighted \citep{taubenfeld2025cisc} and universal \citep{chen2024usc} extensions alleviate this, but the core limitation persists.
10	Recent neuro-symbolic methods \citep{pan2023logiclm, olausson2023linc, xu2026dylos, li2025aristotle, wang2025fover, luo2025logicagent} report gains on logical reasoning but introduce components beyond the reasoning model.
11	A simpler question precedes these: can the \emph{same} model extract useful formal constraints from its own traces---a zero-cost upgrade requiring no additional model or data?
12	No prior work has systematically evaluated this.
13	
14	We ground our analysis in the Condorcet Jury Theorem (CJT) \citep{condorcet1785}: if $K$ independent voters each answer correctly with probability $p > 0.5$, the majority converges to truth \citep{austensmith1996}.
15	When independence fails \citep{ladha1992correlated}, additional samples carry diminishing information.
16	Measuring inter-trace agreement with Fleiss' $\kappa$ \citep{fleiss1971kappa}, we find $\kappa = 0.21$--$0.82$ across instruction-tuned conditions, yielding Effective-$K = 1.20$--$3.62$ for nominal $K = 12$: traces beyond a dozen add negligible independent information (\S\ref{sec:effective-k}).
17	The bottleneck runs deeper than answer-level agreement suggests.
18	Chain-of-thought cosine similarity ($0.69$) far exceeds answer-level $\kappa$ ($0.41$), revealing that traces share reasoning processes even when they diverge on final answers (\S\ref{sec:process-kappa}).
19	When the same model extracts logical constraints from these correlated traces, the constraints exhibit \emph{symbolic confirmation bias}: on problems where the model errs, 83.3\% of self-extracted constraints support the wrong majority answer (bias ratio $4.97\times$), and 94\% of errors overlap with SC (\S\ref{sec:confirmation-bias}).
20	Self-extraction cannot supply the independent signal that CJT requires.
21	
22	We study this through Symbolic Invariant Consensus Aggregation (SICA): extract logical constraints from each of $K$ reasoning traces, deduplicate by syntactic equivalence, and select the answer best supported by a weighted partial MAX-SAT solution via Z3 \citep{demoura2008z3} (\S\ref{sec:pipeline}; Figure~\ref{fig:pipeline}).
23	We evaluate SICA across six models (7B--32B), three reasoning domains (FOLIO \citep{han2022folio}, ProofWriter \citep{tafjord2021proofwriter}, LogiQA \citep{liu2020logiqa}), and over 3,000 condition-evaluations with four-seed replication (Table~\ref{tab:main_results}).
24	Twenty-seven remediation strategies spanning fifteen families all produce neutral or negative results, confirming the bottleneck persists at the 7B--32B scale.
25	Prior work establishes that LLMs cannot self-correct without external feedback \citep{huang2024selfcorrect, stechly2025selfverification}, but concerns natural-language self-correction. Z3 introduces a \emph{sound}, non-neural channel that \emph{guarantees} logical consistency given well-formed constraints, making self-extraction under formal verification a non-trivial test case. We show that even formal verification inherits the model's bias, revealing process-level homogeneity invisible to answer-only metrics.
26	
27	Oracle controls confirm the mechanism is sound ($+29.90$\,pp Mistral-7B, $+14.22$\,pp Qwen-14B on FOLIO, $p < 0.001$; \S\ref{sec:oracle}), yet self-extraction captures only ${\sim}$12\% of this ceiling.
28	The central finding is a persistent independence-accuracy trade-off: Debate reduces $\kappa$ to 0.15 but collapses accuracy by $-18.6$\,pp; other methods cluster at $\kappa \approx 0.40$--$0.47$, forming a same-model ceiling across three families (\S\ref{sec:remediation}).
29	A cross-architecture proof-of-concept escapes the mirage: DeBERTa NLI yields $+3.50$\,pp on ProofWriter ($p = 0.013$; $+10.67$\,pp at $w{=}5$, $p < 0.001$), confirmed across three NLI architectures (\S\ref{sec:cross-arch}).
30	
31	Our contributions are:
32	\begin{enumerate}[nosep,leftmargin=*]
33	\item \textbf{Symbolic Confirmation Bias.} On incorrect problems, 83.3\% of self-extracted constraints support the wrong majority answer (bias ratio $4.97\times$), and 94\% of errors overlap with SC---even under formal Z3-checked verification (\S\ref{sec:confirmation-bias}).
34	
35	\item \textbf{Independence-Accuracy Trade-off.} Same-model $\kappa \geq 0.40$ across four methods and three model families; twenty-seven remediation strategies (fifteen families) fail. A cross-architecture NLI verifier yields significant gains on two of four generators across model families ($+3.50$\,pp Mistral-7B, $p{=}0.013$; $+4.17$\,pp LLaMA-3.1-8B, $p{=}0.0035$; both at $w{=}3$), suggesting the ceiling is escapable (\S\ref{sec:remediation}, \S\ref{sec:cross-arch}).
36	
37	\item \textbf{Process-Level Independence.} Across four models from three families, CoT cosine similarity ($0.69$--$0.79$) exceeds answer-level $\kappa$ ($0.45$--$0.74$) in every case; the gap is largest for weaker models and narrows with capability, but process homogeneity persists across all architectures (\S\ref{sec:process-kappa}).

      "content": "\\section{Introduction}\\label{sec:introduction}\n\nTest-time computation scaling through multiple reasoning samples has emerged as a practical alternative to scaling model parameters \\citep{snell2025scaling, guo2025deepseekr1}.\nThe dominant aggregation strategy, Self-Consistency (SC) \\citep{wang2023sc}, samples $K$ chain-of-thought traces and selects the majority answer.\nSC is simple, model-agnostic, and effective---but it is hitting a ceiling.\n\\citet{loo2025reevaluating} demonstrate that gains from increasing $K$ plateau and even decline for strong models.\nThe gap between SC's theoretical promise (independent correct voters converge to truth) and its practical behavior (saturating gains) points to a structural mismatch: same-model traces carry correlated errors, and majority voting has no mechanism to correct shared bias.\n\nConfidence-weighted \\citep{taubenfeld2025cisc} and universal \\citep{chen2024usc} extensions alleviate this, but the core limitation persists.\nRecent neuro-symbolic methods \\citep{pan2023logiclm, olausson2023linc, xu2026dylos, li2025aristotle, wang2025fover, luo2025logicagent} report gains on logical reasoning but introduce components beyond the reasoning model.\nA simpler question precedes these: can the \\emph{same} model extract useful formal constraints from its own traces---a zero-cost upgrade requiring no additional model or data?\nNo prior work has systematically evaluated this.\n\nWe ground our analysis in the Condorcet Jury Theorem (CJT) \\citep{condorcet1785}: if $K$ independent voters each answer correctly with probability $p > 0.5$, the majority converges to truth \\citep{austensmith1996}.\nWhen independence fails \\citep{ladha1992correlated}, additional samples carry diminishing information.\nMeasuring inter-trace agreement with Fleiss' $\\kappa$ \\citep{fleiss1971kappa}, we find $\\kappa = 0.21$--$0.82$ across instruction-tuned conditions, yielding Effective-$K = 1.20$--$3.62$ for nominal $K = 12$: traces beyond a dozen add negligible independent information (\\S\\ref{sec:effective-k}).\nThe bottleneck runs deeper than answer-level agreement suggests.\nChain-of-thought cosine similarity ($0.69$) far exceeds answer-level $\\kappa$ ($0.41$), revealing that traces share reasoning processes even when they diverge on final answers (\\S\\ref{sec:process-kappa}).\nWhen the same model extracts logical constraints from these correlated traces, the constraints exhibit \\emph{symbolic confirmation bias}: on problems where the model errs, 83.3\\% of self-extracted constraints support the wrong majority answer (bias ratio $4.97\\times$), and 94\\% of errors overlap with SC (\\S\\ref{sec:confirmation-bias}).\nSelf-extraction cannot supply the independent signal that CJT requires.\n\nWe study this through Symbolic Invariant Consensus Aggregation (SICA): extract logical constraints from each of $K$ reasoning traces, deduplicate by syntactic equivalence, and select the answer best supported by a weighted partial MAX-SAT solution via Z3 \\citep{demoura2008z3} (\\S\\ref{sec:pipeline}; Figure~\\ref{fig:pipeline}).\nWe evaluate SICA across six models (7B--32B), three reasoning domains (FOLIO \\citep{han2022folio}, ProofWriter \\citep{tafjord2021proofwriter}, LogiQA \\citep{liu2020logiqa}), and over 3,000 condition-evaluations with four-seed replication (Table~\\ref{tab:main_results}).\nTwenty-seven remediation strategies spanning fifteen families all produce neutral or negative results, confirming the bottleneck persists at the 7B--32B scale.\nPrior work establishes that LLMs cannot self-correct without external feedback \\citep{huang2024selfcorrect, stechly2025selfverification}, but concerns natural-language self-correction. Z3 introduces a \\emph{sound}, non-neural channel that \\emph{guarantees} logical consistency given well-formed constraints, making self-extraction under formal verification a non-trivial test case. We show that even formal verification inherits the model's bias, revealing process-level homogeneity invisible to answer-only metrics.\n\nOracle controls confirm the mechanism is sound ($+29.90$\\,pp Mistral-7B, $+14.22$\\,pp Qwen-14B on FOLIO, $p < 0.001$; \\S\\ref{sec:oracle}), yet self-extraction captures only ${\\sim}$12\\% of this ceiling.\nThe central finding is a persistent independence-accuracy trade-off: Debate reduces $\\kappa$ to 0.15 but collapses accuracy by $-18.6$\\,pp; other methods cluster at $\\kappa \\approx 0.40$--$0.47$, forming a same-model ceiling across three families (\\S\\ref{sec:remediation}).\nA cross-architecture proof-of-concept escapes the mirage: DeBERTa NLI yields $+3.50$\\,pp on ProofWriter ($p = 0.013$; $+10.67$\\,pp at $w{=}5$, $p < 0.001$), confirmed across three NLI architectures (\\S\\ref{sec:cross-arch}).\n\nOur contributions are:\n\\begin{enumerate}[nosep,leftmargin=*]\n\\item \\textbf{Symbolic Confirmation Bias.} On incorrect problems, 83.3\\% of self-extracted constraints support the wrong majority answer (bias ratio $4.97\\times$), and 94\\% of errors overlap with SC---even under formal Z3-checked verification (\\S\\ref{sec:confirmation-bias}).\n\n\\item \\textbf{Independence-Accuracy Trade-off.} Same-model $\\kappa \\geq 0.40$ across four methods and three model families; twenty-seven remediation strategies (fifteen families) fail. A cross-architecture NLI verifier yields significant gains on two of four generators across model families ($+3.50$\\,pp Mistral-7B, $p{=}0.013$; $+4.17$\\,pp LLaMA-3.1-8B, $p{=}0.0035$; both at $w{=}3$), suggesting the ceiling is escapable (\\S\\ref{sec:remediation}, \\S\\ref{sec:cross-arch}).\n\n\\item \\textbf{Process-Level Independence.} Across four models from three families, CoT cosine similarity ($0.69$--$0.79$) exceeds answer-level $\\kappa$ ($0.45$--$0.74$) in every case; the gap is largest for weaker models and narrows with capability, but process homogeneity persists across all architectures (\\S\\ref{sec:process-kappa}).\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\\centering\n\\small\n\\resizebox{\\columnwidth}{!}{\\begin{tikzpicture}[\n    node distance=0.3cm and 0.1cm,\n    box/.style={draw, rounded corners=2pt, minimum height=0.55cm,\n                text width=1.2cm, align=center, font=\\scriptsize},\n    arr/.style={-{Stealth[length=4pt]}, thick},\n    darr/.style={-{Stealth[length=4pt]}, thick, densely dashed},\n    lbl/.style={font=\\scriptsize, text=gray!70!black},\n    ibottle/.style={draw=red!70!black, densely dashed, rounded corners=3pt,\n                    inner sep=3pt},\n]\n\\node[box] (q) {Question $q$};\n\\node[box, right=of q] (sample) {Sample $K$\\\\traces};\n\\node[box, right=of sample] (extract) {Extract logical\\\\constraints};\n\\node[box, right=of extract] (dedup) {Dedup.\\ +\\\\weight};\n\\node[box, right=of dedup] (maxsat) {MAX-SAT\\\\(Z3)};\n\n\\node[box, below=0.7cm of maxsat, fill=gray!12] (ans) {Answer $a^*$};\n\\node[box, below=0.7cm of sample, fill=gray!12] (sc) {Majority\\\\vote};\n\n\\draw[arr] (q) -- (sample);\n\\draw[arr] (sample) -- (extract);\n\\draw[arr] (extract) -- (dedup);\n\\draw[arr] (dedup) -- (maxsat);\n\\draw[arr] (maxsat) -- (ans);\n\\draw[arr] (sample) -- node[lbl, right, yshift=0pt] {SC} (sc);\n\n\\node[lbl, above=0.01cm of maxsat] {SICA};\n\n\\node[ibottle, fit=(sample)(extract), label={[font=\\scriptsize\\itshape, text=red!70!black]above:Independence Bottleneck}] {};\n\n\\draw[darr, gray!60] ([xshift=-0.1cm]dedup.south) -- ++(0,-0.35) node[lbl, below, yshift=-0.05cm] {oracle: gold FOL};\n\\end{tikzpicture}}\n\\caption{The SICA pipeline.

1	\section{Experiments}
2	\label{sec:experiments}
3	
4	\subsection{Setup}
5	\label{sec:exp-setup}
6	
7	We evaluate SICA against Self-Consistency (SC) across six models on three reasoning domains with over 3,000 condition-evaluations across ${\sim}$1,250 unique instances. Beyond accuracy comparisons, we conduct diagnostic analyses of symbolic confirmation bias and process-level trace independence (\S\ref{sec:analysis}).
8	
9	\paragraph{Models.} Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct, Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, Qwen3-14B (non-thinking mode)~\citep{yang2024qwen25}, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3~\citep{jiang2023mistral}, LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct~\citep{dubey2024llama3}, and QwQ-32B~\citep{qwen2024qwq} (7B--32B parameters).
10	
11	\paragraph{Datasets.} FOLIO~\citep{han2022folio} ($n{=}204$, with gold logical annotations), ProofWriter depth-5~\citep{tafjord2021proofwriter} ($n{=}600$), LogiQA~\citep{liu2020logiqa} ($n{=}200$). StrategyQA~\citep{geva2021strategyqa} ($n{=}200$) serves as a domain-formalizability diagnostic. GSM8K~\citep{cobbe2021gsm8k} ($n{=}30$) and AIME 2024 ($n{=}22$) probe the degenerate regime ($C_0 < 5\%$).
12	
13	\paragraph{Parameters.} $K{=}12$ traces at $T{=}0.7$; extraction at $T_{\text{ext}}{=}0.3$. Z3 timeout: 10s. $\alpha{=}0.5$. Statistical significance via McNemar exact test ($\alpha{=}0.05$); 95\% bootstrap CIs from 10,000 resamples for $n \geq 200$.
14	
15	\paragraph{Computational cost.} On Mistral-7B FOLIO ($K{=}12$), SICA takes $4.5{\times}$ SC wall-clock time; constraint extraction ($K$ additional LLM calls) accounts for 76\% of overhead, Z3 solving is negligible (${<}0.1\%$).
16	
17	
18	\subsection{Main Results}
19	\label{sec:main-results}
20	
21	Table~\ref{tab:main_results} reports accuracy across all conditions sorted by SC baseline. We identify three empirical regimes (thresholds observation-driven, not theoretically derived). SICA effectiveness depends sharply on this accuracy regime.
22	
23	\begin{table*}[t]

66	None of sixteen non-degenerate conditions shows a significant SICA effect after FDR control (Benjamini--Hochberg, $m{=}16$). Two show nominally significant degradation (uncorrected McNemar $p < 0.05$): Mistral-7B on ProofWriter ($-2.83$\,pp, raw $p = 0.014$) and Qwen2.5-14B on ProofWriter ($-2.50$\,pp, raw $p = 0.011$); adjusted $p = 0.112$ for both. The intermediate-SC region (50--55\%) contains the only positive trends, none reaching $p < 0.05$. TOST equivalence tests \citep{lakens2017equivalence} ($\pm 2$\,pp) establish equivalence for 5 conditions; 5 show genuine differences (4 negative); 6 are underpowered (Appendix~\ref{app:tost}). We trace the failure to three mechanisms in \S\ref{sec:confirmation-bias}--\S\ref{sec:remediation}.
67	
68	
69	\subsection{Oracle Control}
70	\label{sec:oracle}
71	
72	Oracle variants replace self-extracted constraints with gold annotations: logical formulae from FOLIO ($n = 204$) and DSL from ProofWriter ($n = 600$). Oracle-SICA yields $+29.90$\,pp on Mistral-7B FOLIO ($p < 10^{-13}$), $+14.22$\,pp on Qwen2.5-14B FOLIO ($p = 2.0 \times 10^{-7}$), and $+11.50$\,pp on ProofWriter ($p < 10^{-14}$). Z3 agrees with gold labels on 95.1\% (FOLIO) and 97.1\% (ProofWriter) of problems. The MAX-SAT mechanism is sound; Mistral-7B's best self-extracted result ($+3.43$\,pp) captures only 11.5\% of its oracle ceiling, with ${\sim}$88\% lost to extraction quality.

1	\section{Cross-Architecture Proof-of-Concept}
2	\label{sec:solutions}
3	\label{sec:cross-arch}
4	
5	\paragraph{Method.}
6	We test this with DeBERTa-large \citep{he2021deberta} (406M, encoder-only), fine-tuned on MultiNLI \citep{williams2018mnli}, classifying (premise, conclusion) pairs into \textsc{entailment}, \textsc{contradiction}, or \textsc{neutral}. In combo mode, the NLI verdict is integrated with SC's $K$ votes via weight $w$: each NLI-supporting vote counts $w$ times. We evaluate on Mistral-7B FOLIO ($n = 204$) and ProofWriter depth-5 ($n = 600$), because NLI classification requires (premise, conclusion) pairs that these datasets naturally provide; multiple-choice datasets (LogiQA) lack this structure.
7	
8	\paragraph{Main result.}
9	DeBERTa NLI alone achieves 49.51\% on FOLIO (below SC's 55.88\%) and 55.00\% on ProofWriter (above SC's 39.33\%). On FOLIO ($n = 204$), combo mode yields $+1.96$\,pp at $w{=}1$ and $+2.94$\,pp at $w{=}3$ (both n.s.). On ProofWriter ($n = 600$), $w{=}3$ achieves $+3.50$\,pp ($p = 0.013$) and $w{=}5$ reaches $+10.67$\,pp ($p < 0.001$)---while same-model SICA \emph{degrades} ProofWriter ($-2.83$\,pp, raw $p = 0.014$; BH adj.\ $p = 0.112$; Table~\ref{tab:main_results}), illustrating that corrective signal must originate outside the model's distribution (\S\ref{sec:mirage}). We report $w{=}3$ as primary; $w$ is a dataset-specific hyperparameter ($w{=}5$ yields $+10.67$\,pp on Mistral-7B but only $+1.67$\,pp n.s.\ on LLaMA-3.1-8B), and higher weights risk overfitting. After Benjamini--Hochberg correction ($m{=}6$), ProofWriter $w{=}3$ remains significant (adjusted $p = 0.038$) and $w{=}5$ ($p < 0.001$); FOLIO comparisons are non-significant. Per-label caveat: DeBERTa over-predicts \textsc{False} on ProofWriter (67.8\%) and performs poorly on \textsc{Unknown} (3.5\% accuracy), as NLI's ``neutral'' fails to capture logical unknowability.
10	
11	\paragraph{Why it works.}
12	The 406M encoder-only DeBERTa and 7B decoder-only Mistral share no architecture, training data, or inference mechanism, satisfying the independence condition that same-model sampling cannot provide (\S\ref{sec:mirage}). Per-label complementarity emerges: NLI excels on \textsc{False} (71.43\% vs.\ SC's 38.10\%), SC dominates \textsc{Unknown} (68.12\% vs.\ 18.84\%). All three NLI architectures tested (DeBERTa, RoBERTa, BART) produce significant improvements at $w \geq 3$ (Appendix~\ref{app:multi-nli}).
13	
14	\paragraph{Capability gap hypothesis.}
15	We evaluate four generators from three model families spanning a 46-point SC range on ProofWriter ($n{=}600$), all paired with the identical DeBERTa-large-mnli verifier (55.00\% standalone). Combo gain decreases monotonically with generator capability (Spearman $\rho = 0.970$, $p < 0.001$; Table~\ref{tab:cross_generator_nli}; Figure~\ref{fig:capability-gap}): Mistral-7B (SC${=}$39.33\%, gap${=}{+}15.67$) gains $+3.50$\,pp ($p{=}0.013$) and LLaMA-3.1-8B (SC${=}$70.00\%, gap${=}{-}15.00$) achieves $+4.17$\,pp ($p{=}0.0035$), while Qwen2.5-14B and Qwen3-14B plateau at ${\leq}1.00$\,pp (n.s.). NLI escape persists even when the verifier is moderately weaker in standalone accuracy, but vanishes as the capability gap widens (${\leq}{-}18.5$\,pp). Sigmoid and linear fits yield similar adjusted $R^2$ ($0.781$ vs.\ $0.752$; $\Delta = 0.029$), so we report the monotonic trend rather than a specific inflection point. Two of four generators---from distinct model families---show statistically significant improvement (both surviving Benjamini--Hochberg correction at $m{=}12$), ruling out generator-specific confounds.

In combo mode, the NLI verdict is integrated with SC's $K$ votes via weight $w$: each NLI-supporting vote counts $w$ times. We evaluate on Mistral-7B FOLIO ($n = 204$) and ProofWriter depth-5 ($n = 600$), because NLI classification requires (premise, conclusion) pairs that these datasets naturally provide; multiple-choice datasets (LogiQA) lack this structure.\n\n\\paragraph{Main result.}\nDeBERTa NLI alone achieves 49.51\\% on FOLIO (below SC's 55.88\\%) and 55.00\\% on ProofWriter (above SC's 39.33\\%). On FOLIO ($n = 204$), combo mode yields $+1.96$\\,pp at $w{=}1$ and $+2.94$\\,pp at $w{=}3$ (both n.s.). On ProofWriter ($n = 600$), $w{=}3$ achieves $+3.50$\\,pp ($p = 0.013$) and $w{=}5$ reaches $+10.67$\\,pp ($p < 0.001$)---while same-model SICA \\emph{degrades} ProofWriter ($-2.83$\\,pp, raw $p = 0.014$; BH adj.\\ $p = 0.112$; Table~\\ref{tab:main_results}), illustrating that corrective signal must originate outside the model's distribution (\\S\\ref{sec:mirage}). We report $w{=}3$ as primary; $w$ is a dataset-specific hyperparameter ($w{=}5$ yields $+10.67$\\,pp on Mistral-7B but only $+1.67$\\,pp n.s.\\ on LLaMA-3.1-8B), and higher weights risk overfitting. After Benjamini--Hochberg correction ($m{=}6$), ProofWriter $w{=}3$ remains significant (adjusted $p = 0.038$) and $w{=}5$ ($p < 0.001$); FOLIO comparisons are non-significant. Per-label caveat: DeBERTa over-predicts \\textsc{False} on ProofWriter (67.8\\%) and performs poorly on \\textsc{Unknown} (3.5\\% accuracy), as NLI's ``neutral'' fails to capture logical unknowability.\n\n\\paragraph{Why it works.}\nThe 406M encoder-only DeBERTa and 7B decoder-only Mistral share no architecture, training data, or inference mechanism, satisfying the independence condition that same-model sampling cannot provide (\\S\\ref{sec:mirage}). Per-label complementarity emerges: NLI excels on \\textsc{False} (71.43\\% vs.\\ SC's 38.10\\%), SC dominates \\textsc{Unknown} (68.12\\% vs.\\ 18.84\\%). All three NLI architectures tested (DeBERTa, RoBERTa, BART) produce significant improvements at $w \\geq 3$ (Appendix~\\ref{app:multi-nli}).\n\n\\paragraph{Capability gap hypothesis.}\nWe evaluate four generators from three model families spanning a 46-point SC range on ProofWriter ($n{=}600$), all paired with the identical DeBERTa-large-mnli verifier (55.00\\% standalone). Combo gain decreases monotonically with generator capability (Spearman $\\rho = 0.970$, $p < 0.001$; Table~\\ref{tab:cross_generator_nli}; Figure~\\ref{fig:capability-gap}): Mistral-7B (SC${=}$39.33\\%, gap${=}{+}15.67$) gains $+3.50$\\,pp ($p{=}0.013$) and LLaMA-3.1-8B (SC${=}$70.00\\%, gap${=}{-}15.00$) achieves $+4.17$\\,pp ($p{=}0.0035$), while Qwen2.5-14B and Qwen3-14B plateau at ${\\leq}1.00$\\,pp (n.s.).

1	\paragraph{Scale and language.}
2	All models range from 7B to 32B parameters; whether the independence bottleneck persists at larger scales (70B+) or with reasoning-specialized models is untested. All datasets are English-language logical reasoning benchmarks with discrete answer spaces. We do not evaluate trained symbolic extractors, external solvers with verified grounding, or multilingual settings. Oracle analysis is limited to FOLIO and ProofWriter (gold annotations available); extending to commonsense reasoning requires constructing comparable gold constraint sets. The cross-architecture NLI verifier (\S\ref{sec:cross-arch}) provides no benefit on LogiQA (combo $\Delta \leq +1$\,pp, all $p > 0.5$), indicating that cross-architecture escape requires task-verifier alignment---NLI is effective only when the task naturally decomposes into premise-conclusion entailment. Even on compatible tasks, NLI gain vanishes when the capability gap is large (Qwen3-14B ProofWriter: SC 85\% vs.\ DeBERTa 55\%, gap $= -30$\,pp, $\Delta \leq +1.00$\,pp, n.s.), though moderate negative gaps still yield significant gains (LLaMA-3.1-8B: gap $= -15$\,pp, $+4.17$\,pp, $p = 0.0035$; \S\ref{sec:cross-arch}). Scaling the cross-architecture approach---via trained verifiers, code-based symbolic execution, or multi-verifier ensembles---remains unexplored and may extend the escape to stronger generators and broader task types.
3	
4	\paragraph{Statistical power.}
5	The per-label complementarity analysis of the cross-architecture NLI result (\S\ref{sec:cross-arch}) involves small cell sizes (e.g., 42 \textsc{False} problems, 69 \textsc{Unknown} problems); per-label McNemar tests would be underpowered. The bias ratio metric ($4.97\times$) was initially computed on a single condition (Mistral-7B FOLIO, $n = 204$); cross-model replication (Table~\ref{tab:cross-model-bias}) confirms the pattern but is limited to FOLIO. Four-seed replication shows 2 of 4 seeds yielding null or negative results, and the intermediate-SC region is narrow (SC $\approx$ 50--55\%). The process-level similarity metric uses TF-IDF representations (a lower bound on true process similarity). Pairwise Pearson $r$ between traces (mean $0.625$, Mistral-7B) is monotonically related to Fleiss' $\kappa$ across all four model families, supporting $\kappa$ as a valid consensus proxy despite the simplifying assumptions of Eq.~\ref{eq:effk}.
6	
7	\paragraph{Computational cost trade-off.}
8	SICA requires $4.5\times$ the wall-clock time of SC (81.4 vs.\ 17.7\,min for 204 questions at $K{=}12$), with constraint extraction accounting for 76\% of overhead (\S\ref{sec:exp-setup}). This $3.5\times$ additional cost yields no significant accuracy gain on any condition, making the method impractical in its current form. Alternative prompting strategies (few-shot, chain-of-thought extraction) might improve extraction quality, though the oracle gap suggests the bottleneck is structural. Additional limitations regarding power analysis and deduplication strategy are discussed in Appendix~\ref{app:limitations-extended}.
9	
10	\paragraph{Reproducibility.} All code, data, and experimental scripts will be released upon publication to facilitate replication of SICA, the oracle controls, and all remediation experiments.

4	We test the three predictions of the Symbolic Mirage hypothesis (\S\ref{sec:mirage}).

6	\subsection{Condorcet Effective-K}
7	\label{sec:effective-k}
8	
9	Table~\ref{tab:independence} reports Fleiss' $\kappa$ and Effective-K (Eq.~\ref{eq:effk}) across 15 conditions at $K = 12$. Among instruction-tuned models, $\kappa$ ranges from 0.21 to 0.82, yielding $K_{\text{eff}} = 1.20\text{--}3.62$. The four Mistral-7B FOLIO seeds produce $\kappa \in [0.41, 0.51]$, yet $\Delta$ ranges from $+3.43$ to $-0.49$\,pp---seed-level constraint quality, not independence alone, appears to influence the variation. Two conditions are jointly necessary for positive $\Delta$: sufficient $K_{\text{eff}}$ ($\leq 1.30$ never improves) and sufficient SC accuracy ($K_{\text{eff}} = 3.62$ with SC $= 39\%$ produces degradation). Cross-model validation confirms universality: all four families produce $\kappa \geq 0.41$ (Table~\ref{tab:kappa_generalization}; Appendix~\ref{app:cross-model-kappa}).

42	\subsection{Symbolic Confirmation Bias}
43	\label{sec:confirmation-bias}
44	
45	Self-extracted constraints systematically confirm the model's majority answer regardless of correctness. On Mistral-7B FOLIO ($n = 204$), when SICA errs, 83.3\% of extracted constraints support the incorrect majority answer---a bias ratio of $4.97\times$ (Table~\ref{tab:cross-model-bias}). Consequently, 94\% of SICA errors overlap with SC errors. The MAX-SAT solver rejects only 3.4\% of constraints on average, confirming degeneration (Eq.~\ref{eq:degenerate}).
46	
47	The causal chain is: the model generates an answer, then extracts logical constraints consistent with it. Constraints use trace-specific variable names (56.4\% zero cross-answer variable overlap), so MAX-SAT retains nearly all and aggregation reduces to weighted majority voting. Confirmation bias generalizes across families: $4.97\times$ (Mistral), $3.93\times$ (Qwen-14B), and $2.88\times$ (LLaMA), all exceeding $1.0$ (Table~\ref{tab:cross-model-bias}). Bias intensifies along reasoning steps: late-step constraints (step $\geq 7$) exhibit 27.2\% conclusion leakage vs.\ 22.0\% for early steps (Fisher $p = 3 \times 10^{-6}$); SICA restricted to late-only constraints degrades by $-10.3$\,pp (Appendix~\ref{app:error-categorization}).
48	
49	
50	\subsection{Process-Level Independence}
51	\label{sec:process-kappa}
52	
53	Answer-level $\kappa$ may underestimate the independence bottleneck: two traces can follow nearly identical reasoning yet reach different final answers, causing $\kappa$ to treat them as disagreeing. We define process similarity as the mean pairwise cosine similarity of TF-IDF trace representations:
54	\begin{equation}
55	\label{eq:process-sim}
56	\text{ProcessSim}(q) = \frac{2}{K(K{-}1)} \sum_{i < j} \cos(\mathbf{v}_i^q, \mathbf{v}_j^q),
57	\end{equation}
58	where $\mathbf{v}_i^q$ is the TF-IDF vector of trace $t_i$ for question $q$. On Mistral-7B FOLIO ($n = 204$), mean ProcessSim is $0.69$, far exceeding answer-level $\kappa = 0.41$. The process--answer correlation is model-strength dependent: $r = -0.06$ ($p = 0.36$) on Mistral-7B, where answer diversity does not reflect reasoning diversity (Appendix Figure~\ref{fig:process-kappa}), rising to $r = +0.24$ ($p < 0.001$) on Qwen2.5-14B. This pattern generalizes across four families (Table~\ref{tab:cross-model-process}): the cosine--$\kappa$ gap narrows from $0.23$ (Mistral) to $0.02$ (Qwen-14B), meaning answer-level $\kappa$ already captures the bottleneck for strong models, while process-$\kappa$ reveals hidden homogeneity in weaker models where answer diversity masks process convergence. In all families, interventions targeting answer diversity (temperature scaling, diverse prompting) cannot alter the underlying reasoning paths.
59	
60	
61	\subsection{Supporting Diagnostics}
62	\label{sec:diagnostics}
63	
64	Further diagnostics---constraint ablation, discriminativeness, entropy decomposition, and hyperparameter sensitivity---confirm the mechanism (Appendices~\ref{app:extraction}--\ref{app:entropy}). One positive signal emerges: Z3-based semantic deduplication removes ${\sim}$10\% additional constraints beyond syntactic dedup and yields a small but significant improvement ($p = 0.013$), indicating that the formal verification mechanism itself adds value---but this gain is overwhelmed by confirmation bias ($\text{BR} = 4.97\times$).
65	
66	
67	\subsection{Remediation Analysis}
68	\label{sec:remediation}
69	\label{sec:interventions}
70	
71	Twenty-seven remediation strategies all produce neutral-to-negative results (Figure~\ref{fig:interventions-summary}; Tables~\ref{tab:method_interventions}, \ref{tab:remediation}, \ref{tab:additional_interventions}). At the method level, Debate achieves the lowest $\kappa = 0.15$ but collapses accuracy by $-18.6$\,pp ($p < 0.001$); all other methods cluster at $\kappa \approx 0.40$--$0.47$, confirming a same-model ceiling: methods that increase independence destroy accuracy, and vice versa (Appendix Table~\ref{tab:kappa_generalization}).

10	\end{figure}
11	
12	\section{Prompt Templates}
13	\label{app:prompts}
14	
15	SICA uses domain-specific prompt templates for constraint extraction: one for mathematical reasoning (GSM8K, AIME) and one for logical reasoning (ProofWriter, FOLIO). Both share the same system prompt. The LLM is called with temperature $T{=}0.3$, max tokens $1024$, and structured JSON output mode. Up to 6 traces are processed in parallel via thread pooling, with 2 retries on failure (exponential backoff, base 0.5s).
16	
17	\paragraph{System Prompt.}
18	
19	\begin{lstlisting}
20	You are a constraint extraction tool. Output ONLY
21	valid JSON. Do NOT solve problems, reason about
22	correctness, or think step-by-step. Extract
23	constraints from the given trace exactly as stated.
24	\end{lstlisting}
25	
26	\paragraph{Mathematical Constraint Extraction (EXTRACTION\_PROMPT).}
27	
28	Used for GSM8K and AIME datasets. The placeholder \texttt{\{trace\}} is replaced with the reasoning trace at runtime.
29	
30	\begin{lstlisting}
31	Extract mathematical constraints from this reasoning
32	trace as a JSON object.
33	
34	Rules:
35	- type: "equation", "inequality", or "predicate"
36	- expression: human-readable, e.g. "x + y == 14"
37	- z3_formula: a single comparison expression in
38	  Python Z3 syntax
39	- source_step: step number where the constraint
40	  appears
41	- Use variable names from the trace
42	
43	z3_formula MUST follow these rules:
44	- Allowed operators: ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=, +, -, *,
45	  /, **, %
46	- Use individual named variables: a1, a2, a3...
47	  NOT arrays a[1] or sets A
48	- Expand all sums explicitly:
49	  "a1 + a2 + a3 == 55" NOT "sum([a1,a2,a3])"
50	- NO Python builtins: sum(), len(), max(), min(),
51	  list(), set(), range(), int()
52	- Each z3_formula must be exactly ONE comparison
53	  (==, !=, <, >, <=, >=)
54	- For multiple values, write separate constraints
55	  for each
56	
57	Output ONLY the JSON below, nothing else:
58	{"constraints": [{"type": "equation",
59	  "expression": "x + y == 14",
60	  "z3_formula": "x + y == 14",
61	  "source_step": 1}],
62	 "answer": "final_answer",
63	 "variables": ["x", "y"]}
64	
65	Trace:
66	{trace}
67	\end{lstlisting}
68	
69	\paragraph{Logical Constraint Extraction (LOGIC\_EXTRACTION\_PROMPT).}
70	
71	Used for ProofWriter and FOLIO datasets.
72	
73	\begin{lstlisting}
74	IMPORTANT: You are an EXTRACTION tool, NOT a problem
75	solver.
76	- Do NOT re-solve or re-reason about the problem.
77	- Do NOT verify whether the trace's reasoning is
78	  correct.
79	- ONLY extract the logical constraints that are
80	  explicitly stated or used in the trace below.
81	- Output ONLY the JSON object, nothing else.
82	
83	Extract logical constraints from this reasoning trace
84	about a logic problem.
85	
86	The problem has facts (base assertions), rules
87	(grounded implications), and derived conclusions.
88	Convert each into a Z3 boolean formula.
89	
90	Variable naming:
91	- Unary property: property_entity
92	  (e.g., kind_anne, red_charlie, round_fiona)
93	- Binary relation: relation_subject_object
94	  (e.g., eats_bear_squirrel, likes_lion_cat)
95	- Use lowercase with underscores only
96	
97	Constraint types:
98	- "fact": a given assertion,
99	  e.g., kind_anne == True

This table includes additional exploratory conditions not reported in Table~\ref{tab:main_results}.}
228	\label{tab:capability_trap}
229	\end{table}
230	
231	
232	\section{Statistical Power Analysis}
233	\label{app:power}
234	
235	We compute the minimum detectable effect (MDE) for each condition at $\alpha = 0.05$ and 80\% power using exact binomial power calculations over McNemar discordant pairs. Table~\ref{tab:power} reports three grouped conditions with $n \geq 200$ (Qwen2.5-14B FOLIO and ProofWriter are pooled into a single $n{=}804$ analysis, corresponding to four Table~\ref{tab:main_results} rows), which constitute our confirmatory analyses. The remaining seven conditions ($n \leq 60$) yield infinite MDE due to insufficient discordant pairs and serve only as regime characterization.
236	
237	\begin{table}[h]
238	\centering
239	\small
240	\begin{tabular}{lrrrrr}
241	\toprule
242	\textbf{Condition} & $n$ & \textbf{MDE} & \textbf{Obs.\ $\Delta$} & \textbf{Obs.\ Pow.} \\
243	\midrule
244	Qwen-14B FOLIO+PW   & 804 & 1.86pp & $+$0.25pp & 5.7\%  \\
245	LLaMA-8B StrategyQA  & 200 & 4.64pp & $+$2.00pp & 20.6\% \\
246	LLaMA-8B FOLIO       & 204 & 4.84pp & $-$4.41pp & 18.6\% \\
247	\bottomrule
248	\end{tabular}
249	\caption{Power analysis for confirmatory conditions ($n \geq 200$). MDE = minimum detectable effect at 80\% power. All observed effects fall below their respective MDEs, and observed power remains below 21\% in every case.}
250	\label{tab:power}
251	\end{table}
252	
253	The largest study (Qwen-14B, $n{=}804$, 30 discordant pairs) can detect effects as small as 1.86pp, yet the observed $\Delta$ of $+$0.25pp is an order of magnitude smaller. The two LLaMA-8B conditions require effects of 4.64pp and 4.84pp to reach significance; neither observed $\Delta$ approaches these thresholds. All three conditions are consistent with the null hypothesis that SICA provides no accuracy gain over self-consistency.
254	
255	
256	\section{Bootstrap Confidence Intervals}
257	\label{app:bootstrap}
258	
259	We compute 95\% confidence intervals for $\Delta(\text{SICA} - \text{SC})$ via 10{,}000 bootstrap resamples (percentile method, seed 42). Table~\ref{tab:bootstrap} reports the results for the three confirmatory conditions.
260	
261	\begin{table}[h]
262	\centering
263	\small
264	\begin{tabular}{lrrl}
265	\toprule
266	\textbf{Condition} & $n$ & \textbf{Obs.\ $\Delta$} & \textbf{95\% CI} \\
267	\midrule
268	Qwen-14B FOLIO+PW   & 804 & $+$0.25pp & [$-$1.12, $+$1.62] \\
269	LLaMA-8B StrategyQA  & 200 & $+$2.00pp & [$-$1.50, $+$5.50] \\
270	LLaMA-8B FOLIO       & 204 & $-$4.41pp & [$-$5.88, $+$0.98] \\
271	\bottomrule
272	\end{tabular}
273	\caption{Bootstrap 95\% confidence intervals for $\Delta(\text{SICA} - \text{SC})$ in percentage points. All intervals include zero, consistent with no reliable accuracy difference.}
274	\label{tab:bootstrap}
275	\end{table}
276	
277	All three intervals contain zero. The narrowest interval (Qwen-14B, [$-$1.12, $+$1.62]) rules out practically meaningful gains ($>$2pp) even in the most favorable case. The widest interval (LLaMA-8B FOLIO, [$-$5.88, $+$0.98]) skews negative, indicating that SICA may slightly hurt accuracy in this condition. These results corroborate the McNemar tests and power analysis: no condition provides evidence that logical constraint aggregation improves over majority voting.
278	
279	
280	\section{Case Studies: Discordant Predictions}
281	\label{app:case-studies}
282	
283	Among 804 problems, SICA and SC agree on 773 (96.1\%). The 31 discordant cases comprise 16 SICA wins (SICA correct, SC wrong), 14 SC wins (SC correct, SICA wrong), and 1 where both select different wrong answers. All 31 occur at exact ties (entropy${=}1.0$, 6:6 vote split) or near-ties (entropy${\geq}0.9183$, 8:4 at most), since SICA can differ from SC only when constraint weights shift the majority away from SC's tiebreak choice. We present three representative cases that illustrate the mechanism behind capability-accuracy constraint failures.
284	
285	\paragraph{Case 1: SICA Wins (folio\_134, FOLIO).}
286	
287	\emph{Premises}: Some mammals have teeth. Platypus have no teeth. Platypus are mammals. Humans have teeth. \emph{Conclusion}: Humans are mammals. \emph{Gold}: Unknown.
288	
289	The premises state that \emph{some} mammals have teeth and that humans have teeth, but ``having teeth'' is not sufficient for ``being a mammal'' under open-world semantics. SC produces a 6:6 split (Unknown:6, True:6) and tiebreaks alphabetically to True (wrong). SICA extracts 7 constraints; MaxSAT excludes 1 constraint inconsistent with the rest, reducing the weighted score for True-voting traces and tipping the aggregation to Unknown (correct). The excluded constraint likely captured an incorrect inference step (e.g., affirming the consequent) present only in True-voting traces. While SICA succeeds here, the success is coincidental: the excluded constraint happens to anti-correlate with the correct answer.
290	
291	\paragraph{Case 2: SC Wins (ProofWriter-1066\_Q6, ProofWriter).}
292	
293	\emph{Key chain}: White(Bob)$\to$Round(Bob) [white things are round] $\to$ Young(Bob) [all round things are young]. \emph{Conclusion}: ``Bob is not young.'' \emph{Gold}: False (Bob IS young).
294	
295	SC produces a 6:6 split (False:6, True:6) and tiebreaks to False (correct). SICA extracts 17 constraints; MaxSAT excludes 2 that appear preferentially in False-voting traces. These excluded constraints likely captured correct intermediate derivations (e.g., \texttt{young\_bob == True}) that appeared only in traces completing the full deduction chain. By excluding them, MaxSAT removes evidence supporting the correct answer. SICA selects True (wrong). This case illustrates how self-extracted constraints can systematically mislead: correct reasoning steps become discriminative signals that the solver mistakenly penalizes.
296	
297	\paragraph{Case 3: Non-discriminative Constraints (ProofWriter-903\_Q6, ProofWriter).}
298	
299	\emph{Key chain}: Nice(Mouse)$\to$Cold(Mouse) [all nice people are cold] $\to$ Chases(Mouse,Mouse) [nice and cold $\to$ chase mouse]. \emph{Conclusion}: ``The mouse does not chase the mouse.'' \emph{Gold}: False.
300	
301	SC produces a 6:6 split (False:6, Unknown:6) and tiebreaks to False (correct). SICA extracts 44 constraints but excludes only 1 (2.3\%). The remaining 43 are domain facts and grounded rules (\texttt{nice\_mouse == True}, \texttt{Implies(nice\_mouse, cold\_mouse)}, etc.) that Z3 satisfies identically regardless of the final answer. Both False-voting and Unknown-voting traces share the same premises and grounded rules; they differ only in whether the trace completed the full derivation chain. The single excluded constraint carries negligible weight against 43 shared constraints, so SICA collapses to SC.
302	
303	\paragraph{Pattern.}
304	
305	These cases exemplify the general pattern across the 773 agreeing problems: the vast majority of extracted constraints encode shared domain structure rather than answer-specific reasoning, and MaxSAT aggregation degenerates to majority vote. Table~\ref{tab:case_summary} summarizes.

324	\section{ProofWriter Oracle Per-Subtype Analysis}
325	\label{app:pw-oracle-subtype}
326	
327	ProofWriter problems encode deductive rules as Domain-Specific Language (DSL) logic programs. Each problem uses one of four predicate subtypes: attribute predicates with or without negation (AttNeg, AttNoneg), and relation predicates with or without negation (RelNeg, RelNoneg). Relation predicates involve binary relations between entities (e.g., \texttt{eats(bear, squirrel)}), while attribute predicates assign unary properties (e.g., \texttt{kind(anne)}).
328	
329	The oracle pipeline parses these DSL annotations deterministically into Z3 formulas without any LLM involvement. Of the 600 ProofWriter problems, 594 (99.0\%) produce valid Z3 parses; the remaining 6 fail due to unsupported DSL constructs. Across all 7{,}128 trace-problem pairs submitted to Z3, the solver returns a result in every case (0\% solver errors). Z3 evaluations agree with ground-truth labels on 577 of 594 parseable problems (97.14\%), confirming that the deterministic DSL-to-Z3 translation faithfully preserves problem semantics.
330	
331	Table~\ref{tab:pw_oracle_subtype} reports the per-subtype breakdown. Relation-predicate subtypes show substantially larger gains than attribute-predicate subtypes: RelNeg improves by $+17.86$~pp and RelNoneg by $+13.01$~pp, compared to $+9.09$~pp for AttNoneg and $+6.87$~pp for AttNeg. Relation predicates involve longer reasoning chains with more intermediate entities, producing greater answer diversity across traces ($C_0$) and more opportunities for oracle constraints to correct errors.

The remaining seven conditions ($n \\leq 60$) yield infinite MDE due to insufficient discordant pairs and serve only as regime characterization.\n\n\\begin{table}[h]\n\\centering\n\\small\n\\begin{tabular}{lrrrrr}\n\\toprule\n\\textbf{Condition} & $n$ & \\textbf{MDE} & \\textbf{Obs.\\ $\\Delta$} & \\textbf{Obs.\\ Pow.} \\\\\n\\midrule\nQwen-14B FOLIO+PW   & 804 & 1.86pp & $+$0.25pp & 5.7\\%  \\\\\nLLaMA-8B StrategyQA  & 200 & 4.64pp & $+$2.00pp & 20.6\\% \\\\\nLLaMA-8B FOLIO       & 204 & 4.84pp & $-$4.41pp & 18.6\\% \\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}\n\\caption{Power analysis for confirmatory conditions ($n \\geq 200$). MDE = minimum detectable effect at 80\\% power. All observed effects fall below their respective MDEs, and observed power remains below 21\\% in every case.}\n\\label{tab:power}\n\\end{table}\n\nThe largest study (Qwen-14B, $n{=}804$, 30 discordant pairs) can detect effects as small as 1.86pp, yet the observed $\\Delta$ of $+$0.25pp is an order of magnitude smaller. The two LLaMA-8B conditions require effects of 4.64pp and 4.84pp to reach significance; neither observed $\\Delta$ approaches these thresholds. All three conditions are consistent with the null hypothesis that SICA provides no accuracy gain over self-consistency.\n\n\n\\section{Bootstrap Confidence Intervals}\n\\label{app:bootstrap}\n\nWe compute 95\\% confidence intervals for $\\Delta(\\text{SICA} - \\text{SC})$ via 10{,}000 bootstrap resamples (percentile method, seed 42). Table~\\ref{tab:bootstrap} reports the results for the three confirmatory conditions.\n\n\\begin{table}[h]\n\\centering\n\\small\n\\begin{tabular}{lrrl}\n\\toprule\n\\textbf{Condition} & $n$ & \\textbf{Obs.\\ $\\Delta$} & \\textbf{95\\% CI} \\\\\n\\midrule\nQwen-14B FOLIO+PW   & 804 & $+$0.25pp & [$-$1.12, $+$1.62] \\\\\nLLaMA-8B StrategyQA  & 200 & $+$2.00pp & [$-$1.50, $+$5.50] \\\\\nLLaMA-8B FOLIO       & 204 & $-$4.41pp & [$-$5.88, $+$0.98] \\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}\n\\caption{Bootstrap 95\\% confidence intervals for $\\Delta(\\text{SICA} - \\text{SC})$ in percentage points. All intervals include zero, consistent with no reliable accuracy difference.}\n\\label{tab:bootstrap}\n\\end{table}\n\nAll three intervals contain zero. The narrowest interval (Qwen-14B, [$-$1.12, $+$1.62]) rules out practically meaningful gains ($>$2pp) even in the most favorable case. The widest interval (LLaMA-8B FOLIO, [$-$5.88, $+$0.98]) skews negative, indicating that SICA may slightly hurt accuracy in this condition. These results corroborate the McNemar tests and power analysis: no condition provides evidence that logical constraint aggregation improves over majority voting.\n\n\n\\section{Case Studies: Discordant Predictions}\n\\label{app:case-studies}\n\nAmong 804 problems, SICA and SC agree on 773 (96.1\\%). The 31 discordant cases comprise 16 SICA wins (SICA correct, SC wrong), 14 SC wins (SC correct, SICA wrong), and 1 where both select different wrong answers. All 31 occur at exact ties (entropy${=}1.0$, 6:6 vote split) or near-ties (entropy${\\geq}0.9183$, 8:4 at most), since SICA can differ from SC only when constraint weights shift the majority away from SC's tiebreak choice. We present three representative cases that illustrate the mechanism behind capability-accuracy constraint failures.\n\n\\paragraph{Case 1: SICA Wins (folio\\_134, FOLIO).}\n\n\\emph{Premises}: Some mammals have teeth. Platypus have no teeth. Platypus are mammals. Humans have teeth. \\emph{Conclusion}: Humans are mammals. \\emph{Gold}: Unknown.\n\nThe premises state that \\emph{some} mammals have teeth and that humans have teeth, but ``having teeth'' is not sufficient for ``being a mammal'' under open-world semantics. SC produces a 6:6 split (Unknown:6, True:6) and tiebreaks alphabetically to True (wrong). SICA extracts 7 constraints; MaxSAT excludes 1 constraint inconsistent with the rest, reducing the weighted score for True-voting traces and tipping the aggregation to Unknown (correct). The excluded constraint likely captured an incorrect inference step (e.g., affirming the consequent) present only in True-voting traces. While SICA succeeds here, the success is coincidental: the excluded constraint happens to anti-correlate with the correct answer.\n\n\\paragraph{Case 2: SC Wins (ProofWriter-1066\\_Q6, ProofWriter).}\n\n\\emph{Key chain}: White(Bob)$\\to$Round(Bob) [white things are round] $\\to$ Young(Bob) [all round things are young]. \\emph{Conclusion}: ``Bob is not young.'' \\emph{Gold}: False (Bob IS young).\n\nSC produces a 6:6 split (False:6, True:6) and tiebreaks to False (correct). SICA extracts 17 constraints; MaxSAT excludes 2 that appear preferentially in False-voting traces. These excluded constraints likely captured correct intermediate derivations (e.g., \\texttt{young\\_bob == True}) that appeared only in traces completing the full deduction chain. By excluding them, MaxSAT removes evidence supporting the correct answer. SICA selects True (wrong). This case illustrates how self-extracted constraints can systematically mislead: correct reasoning steps become discriminative signals that the solver mistakenly penalizes.\n\n\\paragraph{Case 3: Non-discriminative Constraints (ProofWriter-903\\_Q6, ProofWriter).}\n\n\\emph{Key chain}: Nice(Mouse)$\\to$Cold(Mouse) [all nice people are cold] $\\to$ Chases(Mouse,Mouse) [nice and cold $\\to$ chase mouse]. \\emph{Conclusion}: ``The mouse does not chase the mouse.'' \\emph{Gold}: False.\n\nSC produces a 6:6 split (False:6, Unknown:6) and tiebreaks to False (correct). SICA extracts 44 constraints but excludes only 1 (2.3\\%). The remaining 43 are domain facts and grounded rules (\\texttt{nice\\_mouse == True}, \\texttt{Implies(nice\\_mouse, cold\\_mouse)}, etc.) that Z3 satisfies identically regardless of the final answer. Both False-voting and Unknown-voting traces share the same premises and grounded rules; they differ only in whether the trace completed the full derivation chain. The single excluded constraint carries negligible weight against 43 shared constraints, so SICA collapses to SC.\n\n\\paragraph{Pattern.}\n\nThese cases exemplify the general pattern across the 773 agreeing problems: the vast majority of extracted constraints encode shared domain structure rather than answer-specific reasoning, and MaxSAT aggregation degenerates to majority vote. Table~\\ref{tab:case_summary} summarizes.\n\n\\begin{table}[h]\n\\centering\n\\small\n\\caption{Summary of three representative discordant cases. All occur at exact 6:6 vote ties.

461	\section{Extraction Error Taxonomy}
462	\label{app:extraction}
463	\label{sec:extraction-taxonomy}
464	
465	Constraints must discriminate between candidate answers for MAX-SAT to produce a ranking different from majority vote. We measure discriminative power at two levels on Qwen2.5-14B across FOLIO and ProofWriter ($n = 804$). At the source-trace level, 39.2\% of total constraint weight originates from traces whose answer differs from the plurality, but only 12.1\% of individual constraints fall into this minority category. At the Z3 semantic level, 91.8\% of constraints [95\% CI: 91.2, 92.4] are technically discriminative, producing different satisfiability outcomes when evaluated against different candidate answers. Only 8.2\% are non-discriminative.
466	
467	The high discriminative rate does not translate into accuracy gains because discrimination mirrors the model's own answer distribution. Each trace produces constraints with its own variable names, so Z3 treats identically-intended propositions as unrelated symbols; among cross-answer constraint pairs, 56.4\% share zero Z3 variables. This variable isolation means constraints from different traces are trivially jointly satisfiable, and MAX-SAT retains nearly all of them regardless of source answer. Removing the 8.2\% non-discriminative constraints yields zero accuracy improvement. The discriminative majority does not provide independent signal; it reinforces the majority answer that SC would already select. This confirmation bias, not a lack of discrimination, explains why SICA degenerates to majority voting (Appendix~\ref{app:ablation}).

470	\section{Hyperparameter Sensitivity}
471	\label{app:sensitivity}
472	\label{sec:k-sensitivity}
473	\label{sec:t-sensitivity}
474	
475	\subsection{K Sensitivity}
476	
477	Figure~\ref{fig:k-sensitivity} shows SICA $\Delta$ as a function of the number of sampled traces $K$ for Mistral-7B on FOLIO ($n = 204$, no fixed seed). The relationship is non-monotonic: $K = 4$ yields $\Delta = -1.47$\,pp, $K = 8$ yields $\Delta = -1.96$\,pp, $K = 12$ reaches $\Delta = +3.43$\,pp, $K = 16$ drops to $\Delta = +1.47$\,pp, and $K = 20$ partially recovers to $\Delta = +1.96$\,pp. The recovery at $K = 20$ rules out a simple peaked pattern, but $K = 12$ remains the only setting with $\Delta > 2$\,pp ($p = 0.092$, marginal).
478	
479	The apparent $\Delta$ peak at $K = 12$ is confounded with SC baseline. SICA absolute accuracy plateaus at 59.31\% (121/204) for $K \geq 12$: identical at $K = 12$ and $K = 20$. The $\Delta$ variation across these settings is driven primarily by SC fluctuations rather than by SICA improvement. $K = 12$ produces a relatively low SC (55.88\%), placing it in the intermediate-SC region; $K = 8$ (SC $= 58.33\%$) and $K = 20$ (SC $= 57.35\%$) have higher baselines, compressing $\Delta$ even though SICA accuracy does not change for $K \geq 12$. Additional traces beyond $K = 12$ provide no benefit to SICA absolute performance, consistent with the constraint quality bottleneck. The $K = 12$ $\Delta$ captures only 24.1\% of the oracle ceiling ($+14.22$\,pp).
480	
481	\begin{figure}[h]
482	\centering
483	\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{f3_k_sensitivity}
484	\caption{SICA $\Delta$ (pp) vs.\ number of traces $K$ for Mistral-7B on FOLIO ($n = 204$, default seed, $T = 0.7$). Non-monotonic pattern: SICA accuracy plateaus at 59.31\% for $K \geq 12$; the apparent $\Delta$ peak at $K = 12$ partly reflects a relatively low SC baseline (55.88\%) at that point. Error bars: 95\% bootstrap CI.}
485	\label{fig:k-sensitivity}
486	\end{figure}
487	
488	\subsection{Temperature Sensitivity}
489	
490	Temperature sensitivity on Mistral-7B FOLIO ($n = 204$, default seed) reveals a sharp isolated peak rather than a smooth trend. Across four temperature settings, only $T = 0.7$ produces a positive effect: $T = 0.3$ yields $\Delta = -1.47$\,pp (SC $= 58.33\%$), $T = 0.5$ yields $\Delta = -0.98$\,pp (SC $= 58.33\%$), $T = 0.7$ yields $\Delta = +3.43$\,pp (SC $= 55.88\%$), and $T = 1.0$ yields $\Delta = 0.00$\,pp (SC $= 55.39\%$). All other temperatures yield negative or null effects, and the single positive result at $T = 0.7$ is confounded with SC baseline. Combined with the seed sensitivity (0 of 4 seeds reaching $p < 0.05$ at $T = 0.7$), the positive trend depends on a specific combination of temperature, seed, and baseline accuracy that same-model sampling rarely achieves.
491	
492	The parallel between $K$ and $T$ sensitivity points to a common underlying variable. In both sweeps, the setting that produces the largest SICA gain also produces a relatively low SC baseline (55.88\%), which places it in the intermediate-SC region. The hyperparameters themselves ($K$, $T$) are not the causal driver; they modulate SC level, and it is the SC level that determines whether SICA has operating room.
493	
494	
495	\section{Entropy Decomposition}
496	\label{app:entropy}
497	\label{sec:entropy}
498	
499	We partition problems by trace agreement: high-entropy (majority count $\leq 8$ out of $K = 12$) and low-entropy (majority count $\geq 9$). Table~\ref{tab:entropy} reports SICA $\Delta$ within each partition across eight model-dataset conditions.
500	
501	\begin{table}[h]
502	\centering

514	Mistral-7B (s456) & FOLIO & 75 & $-$1.3 & 129 & 0.0 \\

520	\bottomrule
521	\end{tabular}
522	\end{table}
523	
524	Two patterns emerge. First, low-entropy problems produce $\Delta \approx 0$\,pp across all eight conditions: when traces agree, constraints carry no information beyond the majority vote.
525	
526	Second, the direction of SICA's effect on high-entropy problems depends on the accuracy regime, not on entropy alone. In the intermediate-SC region (Mistral-7B on FOLIO, default-seed and seed-123 runs), high-entropy $\Delta$ reaches $+12.8$ and $+9.1$\,pp: traces genuinely disagree, and constraints from correct-answer traces provide discriminative signal that resolves the disagreement. In Type~A conditions (Qwen2.5-14B on FOLIO, $\Delta = -8.2$\,pp), high-entropy problems represent rare deviations from a strong model's consensus; constraints inherit the model's confirmation bias. In Type~C (Mistral-7B on ProofWriter, $\Delta = -4.9$\,pp), high-entropy problems reflect systematic errors. The mechanism is not entropy per se but the interaction of entropy with model capability.
527	
528	
529	\section{Failure Mode Analysis}
530	\label{app:failure-modes}
531	\label{sec:failure-modes}
532	
533	The regime-dependent pattern in Table~\ref{tab:main_results} reflects three distinct failure modes of self-extracted logical constraints.
534	
535	\paragraph{Type A: confirmation bias (SC $\geq$ $\sim$60\%).} Strong models produce consistent reasoning traces, and constraints extracted from those traces mirror the answer distribution. When most constraints support the same candidate, MAX-SAT excludes few clauses ($|\mathcal{C}^{\setminus}| \approx 0$), the penalty term in Eq.~\ref{eq:score} vanishes, and the scoring function degenerates to weighted vote counting (Eq.~\ref{eq:degenerate}). SICA and SC then produce identical predictions. The ablation in Appendix~\ref{app:ablation} confirms this empirically: on Qwen2.5-14B (FOLIO + ProofWriter, $n = 804$), MAX-SAT and count-only baselines agree on 803 of 804 predictions.
536	
537	\paragraph{Type B: non-formalizable domains.} LogiQA problems require pragmatic and contextual reasoning that resists clean logical formalization. Qwen2.5-14B on LogiQA achieves an extraction rate of 86.4\%, but the resulting constraints have a contradiction rate of only 0.8\%: extracted formulas rarely conflict across traces, leaving MAX-SAT with no logical tension to exploit. Mistral-7B on LogiQA sits in the same SC range (51.00\%) yet produces $\Delta = +0.50$\,pp ($p = 1.0$); Qwen2.5-14B on the same domain yields $\Delta = -0.50$\,pp ($p = 1.0$). Neither model benefits, confirming that the right accuracy regime is necessary but not sufficient when the domain resists formalization.
538	
539	\paragraph{Type C: error amplification (SC $\leq$ $\sim$40\%).} When model accuracy is low, the majority of traces reach incorrect answers. Constraints extracted from wrong traces encode incorrect reasoning as formal rules. Z3 treats these rules as soft clauses with weight proportional to their frequency, so the solver preferentially satisfies the wrong constraints and penalizes traces that happen to reach the correct answer. Mistral-7B on ProofWriter ($\Delta = -2.83$\,pp, raw $p = 0.014$; BH adj.\ $p = 0.112$) demonstrates this effect: SICA converts a weak positive signal in trace diversity into a net negative by formalizing the errors.
540	
541	
542	\section{Cross-Model Confirmation Bias}
543	\label{app:cross-model-bias}
544	
545	Table~\ref{tab:cross-model-bias} reports MaxSAT-weighted confirmation bias metrics across three model families on FOLIO ($n = 204$). Weighted bias ratio and wrong-supporting constraint percentage both decrease with model capability, while SICA's accuracy effect shifts from positive (Mistral, intermediate-SC regime) to negative (LLaMA, high-SC regime). Raw bias ratios ($4.97\times$, $3.93\times$, $2.88\times$) are reported in \S\ref{sec:confirmation-bias}.

597	\label{app:cross-model-kappa}
598	
599	Table~\ref{tab:cross_model_kappa} compares trace independence across three model families on the same benchmarks. On FOLIO ($n = 204$), all four models produce $\kappa \geq 0.41$: LLaMA-3.1-8B ($\kappa = 0.41$), Mistral-7B ($\kappa = 0.44$), Qwen2.5-7B ($\kappa = 0.66$), and Qwen2.5-14B ($\kappa = 0.74$). The bottleneck is architecture-independent---no family escapes the correlation floor. Within the Qwen family, $\kappa$ increases from 0.66 (7B) to 0.74 (14B), but Mistral-7B (7B) and LLaMA-3.1-8B (8B) differ by $\Delta\kappa = 0.03$ despite belonging to different families, suggesting that cross-family variation ($\Delta\kappa$ up to 0.22 at similar scale) exceeds within-family scale effects ($\Delta\kappa = 0.08$). Disentangling scale from architecture requires controlled same-family experiments across $\geq$3 scales.

We measure discriminative power at two levels on Qwen2.5-14B across FOLIO and ProofWriter ($n = 804$). At the source-trace level, 39.2\\% of total constraint weight originates from traces whose answer differs from the plurality, but only 12.1\\% of individual constraints fall into this minority category. At the Z3 semantic level, 91.8\\% of constraints [95\\% CI: 91.2, 92.4] are technically discriminative, producing different satisfiability outcomes when evaluated against different candidate answers. Only 8.2\\% are non-discriminative.\n\nThe high discriminative rate does not translate into accuracy gains because discrimination mirrors the model's own answer distribution. Each trace produces constraints with its own variable names, so Z3 treats identically-intended propositions as unrelated symbols; among cross-answer constraint pairs, 56.4\\% share zero Z3 variables. This variable isolation means constraints from different traces are trivially jointly satisfiable, and MAX-SAT retains nearly all of them regardless of source answer. Removing the 8.2\\% non-discriminative constraints yields zero accuracy improvement. The discriminative majority does not provide independent signal; it reinforces the majority answer that SC would already select. This confirmation bias, not a lack of discrimination, explains why SICA degenerates to majority voting (Appendix~\\ref{app:ablation}).\n\n\n\\section{Hyperparameter Sensitivity}\n\\label{app:sensitivity}\n\\label{sec:k-sensitivity}\n\\label{sec:t-sensitivity}\n\n\\subsection{K Sensitivity}\n\nFigure~\\ref{fig:k-sensitivity} shows SICA $\\Delta$ as a function of the number of sampled traces $K$ for Mistral-7B on FOLIO ($n = 204$, no fixed seed). The relationship is non-monotonic: $K = 4$ yields $\\Delta = -1.47$\\,pp, $K = 8$ yields $\\Delta = -1.96$\\,pp, $K = 12$ reaches $\\Delta = +3.43$\\,pp, $K = 16$ drops to $\\Delta = +1.47$\\,pp, and $K = 20$ partially recovers to $\\Delta = +1.96$\\,pp. The recovery at $K = 20$ rules out a simple peaked pattern, but $K = 12$ remains the only setting with $\\Delta > 2$\\,pp ($p = 0.092$, marginal).\n\nThe apparent $\\Delta$ peak at $K = 12$ is confounded with SC baseline. SICA absolute accuracy plateaus at 59.31\\% (121/204) for $K \\geq 12$: identical at $K = 12$ and $K = 20$. The $\\Delta$ variation across these settings is driven primarily by SC fluctuations rather than by SICA improvement. $K = 12$ produces a relatively low SC (55.88\\%), placing it in the intermediate-SC region; $K = 8$ (SC $= 58.33\\%$) and $K = 20$ (SC $= 57.35\\%$) have higher baselines, compressing $\\Delta$ even though SICA accuracy does not change for $K \\geq 12$. Additional traces beyond $K = 12$ provide no benefit to SICA absolute performance, consistent with the constraint quality bottleneck. The $K = 12$ $\\Delta$ captures only 24.1\\% of the oracle ceiling ($+14.22$\\,pp).\n\n\\begin{figure}[h]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{f3_k_sensitivity}\n\\caption{SICA $\\Delta$ (pp) vs.\\ number of traces $K$ for Mistral-7B on FOLIO ($n = 204$, default seed, $T = 0.7$). Non-monotonic pattern: SICA accuracy plateaus at 59.31\\% for $K \\geq 12$; the apparent $\\Delta$ peak at $K = 12$ partly reflects a relatively low SC baseline (55.88\\%) at that point. Error bars: 95\\% bootstrap CI.}\n\\label{fig:k-sensitivity}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\subsection{Temperature Sensitivity}\n\nTemperature sensitivity on Mistral-7B FOLIO ($n = 204$, default seed) reveals a sharp isolated peak rather than a smooth trend. Across four temperature settings, only $T = 0.7$ produces a positive effect: $T = 0.3$ yields $\\Delta = -1.47$\\,pp (SC $= 58.33\\%$), $T = 0.5$ yields $\\Delta = -0.98$\\,pp (SC $= 58.33\\%$), $T = 0.7$ yields $\\Delta = +3.43$\\,pp (SC $= 55.88\\%$), and $T = 1.0$ yields $\\Delta = 0.00$\\,pp (SC $= 55.39\\%$). All other temperatures yield negative or null effects, and the single positive result at $T = 0.7$ is confounded with SC baseline. Combined with the seed sensitivity (0 of 4 seeds reaching $p < 0.05$ at $T = 0.7$), the positive trend depends on a specific combination of temperature, seed, and baseline accuracy that same-model sampling rarely achieves.\n\nThe parallel between $K$ and $T$ sensitivity points to a common underlying variable. In both sweeps, the setting that produces the largest SICA gain also produces a relatively low SC baseline (55.88\\%), which places it in the intermediate-SC region. The hyperparameters themselves ($K$, $T$) are not the causal driver; they modulate SC level, and it is the SC level that determines whether SICA has operating room.\n\n\n\\section{Entropy Decomposition}\n\\label{app:entropy}\n\\label{sec:entropy}\n\nWe partition problems by trace agreement: high-entropy (majority count $\\leq 8$ out of $K = 12$) and low-entropy (majority count $\\geq 9$). Table~\\ref{tab:entropy} reports SICA $\\Delta$ within each partition across eight model-dataset conditions.\n\n\\begin{table}[h]\n\\centering\n\\small\n\\caption{Entropy decomposition of SICA $\\Delta$ (pp).

First, low-entropy problems produce $\\Delta \\approx 0$\\,pp across all eight conditions: when traces agree, constraints carry no information beyond the majority vote.\n\nSecond, the direction of SICA's effect on high-entropy problems depends on the accuracy regime, not on entropy alone. In the intermediate-SC region (Mistral-7B on FOLIO, default-seed and seed-123 runs), high-entropy $\\Delta$ reaches $+12.8$ and $+9.1$\\,pp: traces genuinely disagree, and constraints from correct-answer traces provide discriminative signal that resolves the disagreement. In Type~A conditions (Qwen2.5-14B on FOLIO, $\\Delta = -8.2$\\,pp), high-entropy problems represent rare deviations from a strong model's consensus; constraints inherit the model's confirmation bias. In Type~C (Mistral-7B on ProofWriter, $\\Delta = -4.9$\\,pp), high-entropy problems reflect systematic errors. The mechanism is not entropy per se but the interaction of entropy with model capability.\n\n\n\\section{Failure Mode Analysis}\n\\label{app:failure-modes}\n\\label{sec:failure-modes}\n\nThe regime-dependent pattern in Table~\\ref{tab:main_results} reflects three distinct failure modes of self-extracted logical constraints.\n\n\\paragraph{Type A: confirmation bias (SC $\\geq$ $\\sim$60\\%).} Strong models produce consistent reasoning traces, and constraints extracted from those traces mirror the answer distribution. When most constraints support the same candidate, MAX-SAT excludes few clauses ($|\\mathcal{C}^{\\setminus}| \\approx 0$), the penalty term in Eq.~\\ref{eq:score} vanishes, and the scoring function degenerates to weighted vote counting (Eq.~\\ref{eq:degenerate}). SICA and SC then produce identical predictions. The ablation in Appendix~\\ref{app:ablation} confirms this empirically: on Qwen2.5-14B (FOLIO + ProofWriter, $n = 804$), MAX-SAT and count-only baselines agree on 803 of 804 predictions.\n\n\\paragraph{Type B: non-formalizable domains.} LogiQA problems require pragmatic and contextual reasoning that resists clean logical formalization. Qwen2.5-14B on LogiQA achieves an extraction rate of 86.4\\%, but the resulting constraints have a contradiction rate of only 0.8\\%: extracted formulas rarely conflict across traces, leaving MAX-SAT with no logical tension to exploit. Mistral-7B on LogiQA sits in the same SC range (51.00\\%) yet produces $\\Delta = +0.50$\\,pp ($p = 1.0$); Qwen2.5-14B on the same domain yields $\\Delta = -0.50$\\,pp ($p = 1.0$). Neither model benefits, confirming that the right accuracy regime is necessary but not sufficient when the domain resists formalization.\n\n\\paragraph{Type C: error amplification (SC $\\leq$ $\\sim$40\\%).} When model accuracy is low, the majority of traces reach incorrect answers. Constraints extracted from wrong traces encode incorrect reasoning as formal rules. Z3 treats these rules as soft clauses with weight proportional to their frequency, so the solver preferentially satisfies the wrong constraints and penalizes traces that happen to reach the correct answer. Mistral-7B on ProofWriter ($\\Delta = -2.83$\\,pp, raw $p = 0.014$; BH adj.\\ $p = 0.112$) demonstrates this effect: SICA converts a weak positive signal in trace diversity into a net negative by formalizing the errors.\n\n\n\\section{Cross-Model Confirmation Bias}\n\\label{app:cross-model-bias}\n\nTable~\\ref{tab:cross-model-bias} reports MaxSAT-weighted confirmation bias metrics across three model families on FOLIO ($n = 204$). Weighted bias ratio and wrong-supporting constraint percentage both decrease with model capability, while SICA's accuracy effect shifts from positive (Mistral, intermediate-SC regime) to negative (LLaMA, high-SC regime). Raw bias ratios ($4.97\\times$, $3.93\\times$, $2.88\\times$) are reported in \\S\\ref{sec:confirmation-bias}.\n\n\\begin{table}[h]\n\\centering\n\\small\n\\caption{Cross-model confirmation bias on FOLIO ($n = 204$, $K = 12$).

623	\label{app:cross-model-process}
624	
625	Table~\ref{tab:cross-model-process} extends the process-level independence analysis (\S\ref{sec:process-kappa}) to four model families on FOLIO ($n = 204$). Mean pairwise cosine similarity of TF-IDF trace representations exceeds answer-level $\kappa$ in every family, but the gap is model-strength dependent: it narrows from $0.31$ (LLaMA) and $0.23$ (Mistral) to $0.02$ (Qwen-14B). For weaker models ($r \approx 0$), answer diversity does not reflect reasoning diversity---process-convergent but answer-divergent trace pairs constitute 9.5\% of all pairs on Mistral-7B versus 2.5--3.2\% on other families. For stronger models ($r \approx 0.23$, $p \leq 0.001$), process and answer agreement align, and answer-level $\kappa$ already captures the bottleneck. Process-$\kappa$ thus provides a crucial additional diagnostic specifically for weaker models, where answer-level metrics underestimate reasoning homogeneity.

646	\label{app:constraint-quality}
647	
648	Table~\ref{tab:constraint_quality} compares constraint quality metrics across the three method-level interventions on Mistral-7B FOLIO ($n = 204$). Standard SICA extracts from reasoning traces and achieves the highest parse rate (97.1\%) but also the highest redundancy (42.9\%): nearly half of all constraints are syntactic duplicates across the 12 traces, quantifying the co-sourcing effect of same-model generation. ICG generates constraints directly from the problem statement without trace conditioning. Its lower parse rate (74.6\%) reflects the difficulty of standalone formalization at the 7B scale, though successfully parsed constraints compile at a higher rate (99.4\% vs.\ 96.5\%). ICG produces fewer unique constraints per question (24.9 vs.\ 39.3) with lower redundancy (32.3\%), consistent with the absence of trace-level repetition. Contrastive scoring generates pro and con constraint sets for each candidate answer. The format yields far fewer unique constraints per question (9.2) with zero redundancy (each pro/con pair is structurally distinct), but 62.7\% of constraints are trivially satisfied by Z3---they impose no logical tension and cannot discriminate between candidates. Only 51.0\% of Contrastive constraints are discriminative, compared to 81.4\% for standard SICA and 77.0\% for ICG.

667	\section{Error Categorization of Method-Level Interventions}
668	\label{app:error-categorization}
669	
670	We categorize discordant predictions (where the method and SC disagree) for Debate and Contrastive on FOLIO ($n = 204$) to understand why these interventions degrade accuracy.
671	
672	\paragraph{Debate discordant analysis.} Debate produces 60 correct$\to$wrong flips and 22 wrong$\to$correct flips on FOLIO. Answer-type breakdown reveals that False-labeled questions are most vulnerable: 82.8\% of False questions that SC answers correctly are flipped by Debate, compared to 63.9\% for True and 25.5\% for Unknown. Counterintuitively, failures concentrate not where debate breaks down but where it succeeds most thoroughly: discordant questions average 2.93 effective debate rounds (proposer-critic exchanges producing substantive updates) versus 2.52 for concordant ones. More extensive same-model debate produces more confident but incorrect constraints, consistent with the independence bottleneck---the critic draws on the same model distribution as the proposer, reinforcing shared biases rather than correcting them.
673	
674	\paragraph{Contrastive discordant analysis.} Contrastive produces 34 discordant questions on FOLIO. All 34 produced non-degenerate scores (both pro and con constraint sets non-empty), compared to 20.1\% degenerate scores in the full sample. This indicates that scoring failures on discordant questions stem from systematic pro-bias rather than missing constraints. Among discordant questions, 97.1\% contain negation words in the problem statement versus 76.5\% in the full sample, suggesting that negation-bearing problems are particularly susceptible to pro-constraint imbalance. The average pro/con score ratio is 1.0 for discordant questions versus 0.68 for the full sample: the method generates balanced-looking scores that mask directional errors.
675	
676	\paragraph{Cross-method overlap.} Of the 79 unique questions on which either method disagrees with SC, only 15 overlap between Debate and Contrastive (Jaccard index $= 0.19$). All 15 shared discordant questions contain negation words. The low overlap confirms that the two methods attack different vulnerability types---Debate through extended same-model argumentation that amplifies confident errors, Contrastive through pro-bias in constraint generation---while sharing a common root cause in the independence bottleneck: both methods rely on the same model's output distribution and cannot introduce genuinely independent signal.
677	
678	
679	\section{TOST Equivalence Tests}
680	\label{app:tost}
681	
682	We apply two one-sided tests (TOST) \citep{lakens2017equivalence} with equivalence margin $\pm 2$\,pp to all 16 non-degenerate SICA--SC comparisons. Five conditions fall within the equivalence bounds (Qwen2.5-7B FOLIO, Qwen2.5-14B FOLIO, Mistral-7B LogiQA, Qwen3-14B PW-D5, Qwen3-14B (think) FOLIO), confirming that SICA and SC produce statistically equivalent accuracy. Five conditions show genuine differences outside the equivalence margin: four are negative (PW-D5 Mistral $-2.83$\,pp, PW-D5 Qwen-14B $-2.50$\,pp, FOLIO LLaMA $-4.41$\,pp, FOLIO Qwen3 $-0.49$\,pp with tight CI) and one is positive but non-significant (Mistral FOLIO $+3.43$\,pp, $p = 0.092$). The remaining six conditions are underpowered: the equivalence test is inconclusive and the superiority test is also non-significant, leaving these conditions in an indeterminate zone.

713	\label{app:capability-gap}
714	
715	Table~\ref{tab:cross_generator_nli} reports the controlled cross-generator comparison with a fixed DeBERTa-large-mnli verifier (55.00\% standalone) on ProofWriter ($n{=}600$), spanning four generators from three model families. Figure~\ref{fig:capability-gap} plots these four generators alongside FOLIO conditions and two additional NLI architectures (RoBERTa-MNLI, BART-MNLI on Mistral-7B ProofWriter) at $w{=}3$. Across all eight ProofWriter conditions spanning three NLI architectures and four generators from three families, Spearman $\rho = 0.970$ ($p < 0.001$). Sigmoid and linear fits yield similar adjusted $R^2$ ($0.781$ vs.\ $0.752$; $\Delta = 0.029$; linear slope $= 0.143$ [95\% CI: $0.076$, $0.209$]), indicating that the monotonic trend is robust but the specific functional form is underdetermined with four generators. Restricting to the six DeBERTa-MNLI conditions across both datasets (excluding LLaMA-3.1-8B) yields $\rho = 0.928$ ($p < 0.01$; linear $R^2 = 0.888$, $p = 0.005$). Both analyses converge on the same pattern: significant NLI escape for generators with moderate capability gaps, plateauing for strong generators. Two of four generators---from distinct model families---show significant improvement after Benjamini--Hochberg correction ($m{=}12$): LLaMA-3.1-8B ($p=0.0035$, adj.\ $p < 0.001$) and Mistral-7B ($p=0.013$, adj.\ $p=0.038$). RoBERTa-MNLI and BART-MNLI are shown in the figure for cross-verifier confirmation.

The average pro/con score ratio is 1.0 for discordant questions versus 0.68 for the full sample: the method generates balanced-looking scores that mask directional errors.\n\n\\paragraph{Cross-method overlap.} Of the 79 unique questions on which either method disagrees with SC, only 15 overlap between Debate and Contrastive (Jaccard index $= 0.19$). All 15 shared discordant questions contain negation words. The low overlap confirms that the two methods attack different vulnerability types---Debate through extended same-model argumentation that amplifies confident errors, Contrastive through pro-bias in constraint generation---while sharing a common root cause in the independence bottleneck: both methods rely on the same model's output distribution and cannot introduce genuinely independent signal.\n\n\n\\section{TOST Equivalence Tests}\n\\label{app:tost}\n\nWe apply two one-sided tests (TOST) \\citep{lakens2017equivalence} with equivalence margin $\\pm 2$\\,pp to all 16 non-degenerate SICA--SC comparisons. Five conditions fall within the equivalence bounds (Qwen2.5-7B FOLIO, Qwen2.5-14B FOLIO, Mistral-7B LogiQA, Qwen3-14B PW-D5, Qwen3-14B (think) FOLIO), confirming that SICA and SC produce statistically equivalent accuracy. Five conditions show genuine differences outside the equivalence margin: four are negative (PW-D5 Mistral $-2.83$\\,pp, PW-D5 Qwen-14B $-2.50$\\,pp, FOLIO LLaMA $-4.41$\\,pp, FOLIO Qwen3 $-0.49$\\,pp with tight CI) and one is positive but non-significant (Mistral FOLIO $+3.43$\\,pp, $p = 0.092$). The remaining six conditions are underpowered: the equivalence test is inconclusive and the superiority test is also non-significant, leaving these conditions in an indeterminate zone.\n\n\\section{Multi-Verifier NLI Results}\n\\label{app:multi-nli}\n\n\\begin{table}[h]\n\\centering\n\\small\n\\caption{Cross-architecture NLI combo on ProofWriter depth-5 ($n{=}600$, Mistral-7B traces, SC $= 39.33\\%$).

Figure~\\ref{fig:capability-gap} plots these four generators alongside FOLIO conditions and two additional NLI architectures (RoBERTa-MNLI, BART-MNLI on Mistral-7B ProofWriter) at $w{=}3$. Across all eight ProofWriter conditions spanning three NLI architectures and four generators from three families, Spearman $\\rho = 0.970$ ($p < 0.001$). Sigmoid and linear fits yield similar adjusted $R^2$ ($0.781$ vs.\\ $0.752$; $\\Delta = 0.029$; linear slope $= 0.143$ [95\\% CI: $0.076$, $0.209$]), indicating that the monotonic trend is robust but the specific functional form is underdetermined with four generators. Restricting to the six DeBERTa-MNLI conditions across both datasets (excluding LLaMA-3.1-8B) yields $\\rho = 0.928$ ($p < 0.01$; linear $R^2 = 0.888$, $p = 0.005$). Both analyses converge on the same pattern: significant NLI escape for generators with moderate capability gaps, plateauing for strong generators. Two of four generators---from distinct model families---show significant improvement after Benjamini--Hochberg correction ($m{=}12$): LLaMA-3.1-8B ($p=0.0035$, adj.\\ $p < 0.001$) and Mistral-7B ($p=0.013$, adj.\\ $p=0.038$). RoBERTa-MNLI and BART-MNLI are shown in the figure for cross-verifier confirmation.\n\n\\paragraph{Full NLI combo with BH correction.}\n\\label{app:nli-combo-full}\n\n\\begin{table}[h]\n\\centering\n\\small\n\\caption{Full cross-generator NLI combo results on ProofWriter depth-5 ($n{=}600$) with Benjamini--Hochberg correction ($m{=}12$, $\\alpha{=}0.05$).

823	The gain concentrates in the mid-constraint tertile ($+$9.4\,pp, $p{=}.031$), where sufficient symbolic evidence exists for MaxSAT to meaningfully re-rank answers; in the low- and high-constraint groups the methods perform comparably.

825	We note that with six subgroup tests, one significant result at $\alpha{=}0.05$ is expected by chance; the mid-constraint finding should be interpreted as exploratory.

828	\label{app:limitations-extended}
829	
830	Beyond the limitations discussed in the main text, several additional constraints bound our conclusions. Seven of our eleven model-domain conditions have $n \leq 60$, providing insufficient statistical power for confirmatory claims; power analysis shows that the minimum detectable effect exceeds 5\,pp for these conditions (Table~\ref{tab:power}), so they serve as regime characterization rather than definitive tests. Our extraction prompts use a single zero-shot template per domain; alternative prompting strategies (few-shot exemplars, chain-of-thought extraction, or iterative refinement) might yield higher-quality constraints, though the oracle gap suggests the bottleneck is structural rather than prompt-specific. The constraint quality analysis (91.8\% discriminative rate, 39.2\% source-trace minority weight) covers Qwen2.5-14B on FOLIO + ProofWriter ($N = 804$); other model-domain combinations may exhibit different characteristics. Constraint extraction uses $T_{\text{ext}} = 0.3$ while trace sampling uses $T = 0.7$; alternative extraction temperatures might yield different results. Although we prompt for first-order logic formalizations, 99.0\% of extracted constraints are propositional at the Z3 level, with only 1.0\% using true quantifiers ($\forall$/$\exists$); whether models capable of genuine quantified reasoning would yield higher discriminative rates is untested. Deduplication uses syntactic equivalence (global average dedup ratio: 46.0\%), so semantically equivalent constraints with different surface forms receive separate weights; Z3-based semantic deduplication removes an additional ${\sim}$10\% of constraints and yields a small but significant improvement over no deduplication ($p = 0.013$), suggesting room for better dedup strategies. The GSM8K pilot ($n = 30$) illustrates the constraint-absent regime and should not be interpreted as confirmatory evidence.

## 1. p-value precision: LLaMA p should be 0.0035 (not 0.004)

Let me search all occurrences:

- abstract.tex:8: `$p{=}0.0035$` ✓
- introduction.tex:35: `$p{=}0.0035$` ✓
- solutions.tex:15: text mentions `$p{=}0.0035$` in capability gap paragraph ✓
- solutions.tex:36: Table 3 `0.0035` ✓


- limitations_content.tex:2: `$p = 0.0035$` ✓
- appendix.tex:715: Updated to include `($p=0.0035$, adj.\ $p < 0.001$)` ✓
- appendix.tex:737: `p_raw` is `.0035` ✓

All LLaMA p-values are 0.0035 ✓

Now checking Mistral PW p-values, which should be 0.014 raw with a Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted value of 0.112.  I've verified these across experiments.tex, solutions.tex, and multiple appendix locations. But I'm noticing appendix.tex:732 has `.0125` for the Mistral-7B w=3 case in the NLI combo table, which is a different context than what I'm checking.

Now I'm confirming the actual values in Table 1 and Table 2 — experiments.tex:33 shows `0.014{*}` and analysis.tex:15 confirms the BH-adjusted p-value is 0.112 with m=16. For the w=3 versus w=5 distinction, I'm checking that all the headline numbers in the abstract and introduction use w=3 as stated. I'm verifying the statistical notation across different sections of the paper. The w=5 result in solutions.tex:9 is correctly labeled, and the implicit w=3 context in solutions.tex:15 checks out. But I need to reread the conclusion.tex statement more carefully—it seems to mix the results in a way that needs clarification.

Looking back at introduction.tex:29, I see the +3.50 pp and +10.67 pp values are specifically about Mistral-7B's performance, where the +3.50 corresponds to w=3 (implied from the DeBERTa NLI context in solutions.tex) and the +10.67 is explicitly at w=5. The conclusion doesn't actually specify these w values directly—it just references the architectural diversity finding across the four generators.

Now checking the TOST equivalence counts across the documents: abstract.tex mentions 5/5 with 6 implied, experiments.tex confirms 5/5 with 4 negative and 6 underpowered, and appendix.tex also shows five conditions within equivalence bounds. The count should be 5/5/6, not 4/5/6.

For the Benjamini-Hochberg correction, Table 1's degradation result shows p=0.014 uncorrected but adjusts to p=0.112 after BH correction with m=16, which is properly annotated in the caption and text as nominally significant only before adjustment. Continuing to verify the statistical reporting across all files—checking that p-values are properly qualified with multiple comparison corrections where needed. Everything looks consistent so far.

Now moving on to examine the SC baseline results and their reported accuracy figures. Looking at the abstract, it uses rounded percentages—54% for Mistral-7B and 86% for Qwen3-14B—which matches the caption's reference to 54.41% as the lowest performance on FOLIO across the non-default seeds. The caption says "from Mistral-7B (54.41% SC)" but that's actually the per-seed minimum, not the main result which is 55.88%. Even stranger, PW-D5 scores 39.33%, which is lower than 54.41%, so the caption seems to be specifically referring to the FOLIO model range rather than the overall table minimum.

Let me flag this as a potential inconsistency and then verify the exact values across the different sections — I'm seeing 55.88% for the default and s456, but 54.41% for s123 and s789. Now I'm verifying the 54.41% values across the document—these are all correctly attributed to per-seed results in the experiments and analysis sections. I notice the caption in experiments.tex:26 might be using a per-seed value to describe a range, which could be misleading, but the individual row entries check out. The κ table at appendix.tex:612 uses a different K parameter (K=10 instead of K=12), so that 56.86% SC value is in a separate context and doesn't conflict with the main 55.88% figure.

Moving on to the DeBERTa standalone results at 55.00%—I'm finding this value consistently referenced across solutions.tex and appendix.tex, with explicit mentions of "standalone" in some places and clear context about which dataset (FOLIO vs ProofWriter) in others.

Now checking the "27" remediation claim in the abstract. I need to verify the exact phrasing about the twenty-seven same-model remediation strategies and whether it's consistently stated across the paper.

Looking through the key sections: the abstract mentions twenty-seven strategies spanning fifteen families, and I'm finding this same number repeated in the introduction, analysis, conclusion, and appendix. The figure captions also reference 27 intervention strategies. All instances are consistent at 27 ✓

Now checking the Spearman correlation coefficient across the document — it's ρ=0.970 with p < 0.001 appearing in the abstract, solutions section, and conclusion, with the figure and table captions also citing the same value. Everything checks out at 0.970 ✓

Moving on to verify the BR multiplier values — I'm seeing 4.97× consistently referenced in the method and analysis sections for the Mistral comparison, with additional values of 3.93× for Qwen-14B and 2.88× for LLaMA also appearing consistently.

However, I'm noticing a discrepancy in the appendix table. The weighted BR values there show different numbers: 4.24× for Mistral-7B, 3.69× for Qwen2.5-14B, and 2.66× for LLaMA-3.1-8B. These don't match the raw bias ratios cited elsewhere in the document, so I need to investigate whether these are intentionally different metrics or if there's an error. Looking through the main text to verify the 83.3% figure appears consistently across sections — it does, showing up in the abstract, introduction, and conclusion. The appendix table uses the weighted version (80.9%) instead, which aligns with the raw versus weighted distinction I noted earlier. Now checking the oracle improvement values cited in the abstract and introduction to make sure those match the table as well. I'm verifying the κ parameter values are consistent across the paper—checking that 0.15 appears correctly in the abstract, introduction, and analysis sections, and confirming the accuracy drop calculation matches the reported -18.6pp. I'm also cross-referencing the κ range of 0.21 to 0.82 across multiple sections to ensure all citations align. All the effective K ranges check out consistently across the documents. Now I'm verifying the process similarity metrics — I see cosine similarity values of 0.69 mentioned in the introduction, and I need to check if this appears elsewhere and whether the numbers align. I'm noticing inconsistencies in the κ values across different sections—the main text cites 0.41, but the appendix tables show 0.460 for Mistral-7B FOLIO, and there's variation depending on whether we're looking at different random seeds or trace counts. I need to figure out which κ value is actually being referenced in the process-level analysis. I'm noticing κ=0.41 appears consistently across multiple sections of the paper (abstract, introduction, analysis), but the process-level table shows κ=0.460 for Mistral-7B's answer agreement. This suggests the 0.41 value might be computed differently—perhaps it's the per-question answer agreement rather than the full dataset Fleiss κ, or it could be from a different seed or model variant like the s789 configuration. Looking at the cross-model-process table, I can extract the actual values: Mistral shows cosine similarity of 0.690 and κ of 0.460, LLaMA has 0.759 and 0.447, Qwen-7B reaches 0.790 and 0.658, and Qwen-14B sits at 0.766 with 0.744. The introduction claims ranges of 0.69–0.79 for cosine and 0.45–0.74 for κ, which closely match the observed data from these four models.

However, there's a discrepancy when I look at the specific numbers cited in the abstract and introduction—they mention 0.69 and 0.41 for Mistral, but the cross-model table shows κ of 0.460, not 0.41. The analysis text references Mistral-7B FOLIO with κ = 0.41, yet Table 2 shows different values depending on the seed and K parameter, with the cross-model FOLIO table indicating κ = 0.44 at K=10.

I'm trying to trace where exactly the 0.41 value comes from—it might be LLaMA-3.1-8B's κ instead, which appears consistently at 0.41 in Table 2, or it could be computed under different methodological conditions than what's shown in the main tables.

But there's a real discrepancy here: the text claims Mistral-7B FOLIO has κ=0.41, yet I'm finding κ=0.50 in Table 2 at K=12, κ=0.44 in the cross-model kappa table at K=10, and κ=0.460 for cross-model process answers—none matching 0.41. The abstract and introduction both reference this 0.41 value when comparing cosine similarity to κ, so I need to figure out which model or condition actually produces that number.

I'm wondering if 0.41 comes from a different seed run, or if it's from the LLaMA analysis instead. Looking at the discussion section, I see bias ratio gradients mentioned, and the process section references "answer-level κ = 0.41" which might be computed differently—perhaps as per-question κ values averaged together rather than a global Fleiss κ like in Table 2. That could explain the discrepancy, but I still need to trace where exactly this 0.41 originates to resolve the inconsistency.

The abstract explicitly names it as "answer-level Fleiss' κ (0.41)," but when I check the cross-model-process appendix table, the Answer κ for Mistral-7B shows 0.460, not 0.41. So I'm flagging this as a potential issue—the 0.41 value appears in the abstract and analysis sections for Mistral-7B, but I can't find it in any of the model-specific tables. Though I did notice analysis.tex mentions "On Mistral-7B FOLIO (n = 204)...answer-level κ = 0.41," which suggests the process analysis might be using data from the s789 seed run specifically.

But that doesn't resolve it—the n=204 is the same dataset either way, so the values should match. My best guess is that 0.41 was an earlier calculation that got corrected in the tables but the narrative wasn't updated to reflect it. The contribution section gives a κ range of 0.45-0.74, which aligns perfectly with the process table (0.447-0.744), so the 0.41 stands out as inconsistent. I'll definitely flag this discrepancy.

Now let me verify the claims about "κ ≥ 0.40 across three/four model families" in the introduction.

tex and analysis.tex sections. Looking at the kappa_generalization table, the non-Debate methods all meet this threshold—Diverse-Prompt at 0.40, Self-Consistency at 0.44, ICG at 0.47, and the model-specific variants ranging from 0.41 to 0.74. So that claim checks out. Let me continue examining the other statements in the introduction. I'm checking the different m values used for Benjamini-Hochberg correction across the paper — solutions.tex uses m=6 for the six FOLIO comparisons (three ProofWriter weights plus three FOLIO weights), while the appendix uses m=12 for all four generators across three weights, which makes sense given their different scopes.

Now I'm verifying the adjusted p-value for ProofWriter w=3: if the original p-value was 0.013 and it ranked second among the six comparisons, multiplying by 6/2 gives 0.039, which matches the reported 0.038 within rounding.

I'm also confirming the sample sizes are consistent throughout — FOLIO at 204, ProofWriter at 600, and LogiQA at 200 — and checking that "fifteen families" appears correctly in the abstract and introduction.

For the Qwen2.5-14B ProofWriter p-value, I'm working through the Benjamini-Hochberg correction with m=16 comparisons to verify why both Mistral and Qwen ProofWriter results show an adjusted p-value of 0.112 despite their different raw p-values. 0.112 ✓

Now I'm cross-checking the introduction against the solutions section—the DeBERTa NLI results match up, with the +3.50pp improvement at p=0.013 and the +10.67pp gain at w=5 with p<0.001 both consistent across the documents. Next I'm verifying the cosine-kappa gap measurements in the analysis section, looking at how the gap shrinks from 0.23 in Mistral down to 0.02 in Qwen.

But I'm noticing a discrepancy—the appendix process table shows LLaMA's gap at 0.312, which is actually larger than Mistral's 0.23, yet the text frames Mistral as having the largest gap when it narrows from 0.23 to 0.02. This seems inconsistent with what the data shows. The gap sequence across models isn't actually monotonic — it jumps from Mistral's 0.23 to LLaMA's 0.31 before dropping to Qwen-7B's 0.13 and finally Qwen-14B's 0.02. The analysis cherry-picks the endpoints (Mistral and Qwen-14B) to create a "narrowing" narrative while conveniently skipping over LLaMA, which has the largest gap despite being stronger than Mistral.

Now I'm checking the figure caption discrepancy about intervention strategies. The text says 27, and I can confirm that's correct in the current version. Let me compile the actual inconsistencies I've found so far, starting with a potentially outdated κ value for Mistral-7B in the FOLIO process comparison that appears in both the abstract and introduction. There's a clear mismatch between what the main text reports (κ=0.41) and what the supporting tables show (κ=0.460) — possibly because the analysis is using the minimum value across seeds for conservatism, or there's been a transcription error. Beyond that, the Table 1 caption cites a per-seed accuracy figure (54.41%) rather than the default seed value (55.88%), which seems to violate the consistency rules I'm tracking.

I'm also noticing that the introduction mentions a κ range of 0.45-0.74, where that 0.45 lower bound actually aligns with the process table's LLaMA value, creating an internal inconsistency with the 0.41 cited elsewhere. I've checked categories 1-8 and haven't found other issues, but I should verify the dataset size claims about the 3,000 condition-evaluations and 1,250 unique instances across the abstract and introduction sections.

Now I'm working through the actual numbers: FOLIO appears in roughly 14 different conditions with 204 instances each, giving around 2,856 evaluations but only 204 unique instances, while PW with 600 instances spans 3 conditions, yielding 1,800 evaluations with 600 unique instances. Looking at the breakdown of all 16 non-degenerate conditions from Table 1, I'm tallying up the instances across different model variants and temperature settings for FOLIO, along with the LogiQA and PW-D5 datasets to verify the total count. Now I'm tallying up the total scores from the table, working through the arithmetic carefully to sum all the model results across different benchmarks and configurations.

Looking at the breakdown, the non-degenerate rows add up to around 4,639, and when I include the degenerate cases and oracle conditions, I'm getting a grand total near 5,699. But I notice Table 2 introduces additional condition variants with temperature adjustments that overlap with what's already in Table 1, so there's some redundancy to account for.

The claim about "over 3,000 condition-evaluations" seems to refer to just the non-degenerate rows from Table 1, which tracks with my calculation. And the ~1,250 unique instances across the different datasets (FOLIO, PW, LogiQA, StrategyQA, GSM8K, AIME) checks out when rounded, so the numbers appear consistent enough that I don't need to flag any discrepancies.

Now I'm checking whether Table 2's 15 conditions align properly with Table 1's 16 non-degenerate rows, since Table 2 includes temperature variants from the remediation analysis that aren't present in Table 1. I'm noticing a narrative inconsistency in the analysis—the text claims the gap "narrows from 0.23 (Mistral) to 0.02 (Qwen-14B)" but this omits LLaMA's 0.31 gap, which is actually larger than Mistral's and breaks the monotonic trend the statement implies. It's selectively choosing endpoints to support a narrative that doesn't hold across all models, so I should flag this before finalizing.

Now I'm double-checking the Table 1 caption which states results range "from Mistral-7B (54.41% SC)" but the table itself shows Mistral-7B PW-D5 at 39.33% SC—lower than the cited figure. The caption might be intentionally scoping to just the FOLIO subset rather than the full table, but this ambiguity is worth noting. The 54.41% figure is actually a per-seed result, not the default seed value of 55.88%, which means citing it in the caption without that qualification violates the Director's rule about when per-seed values should appear. Now I'm compiling all my findings across the eight categories to see what's consistent and what isn't. =0.50 in the default seed condition, but other tables show κ ranging from 0.44 to 0.46, and only the s789 seed matches the 0.41 cited throughout the paper. The contribution section claims a κ range of 0.45-0.74 which aligns with the process table, creating a contradiction with the 0.41 value used elsewhere. For Issue B, the experiments table cites 54.41% from Mistral-7B without clarifying this is a per-seed result rather than the default seed baseline of 55.88%.

There's also a problem with how the 54.41% figure is presented—it's not actually the lowest success rate in the table since PW-D5 shows 39.33%, so framing it as representing the "full capability range" is misleading. Moving to Issue C, the narrative about the cosine-κ gap in the analysis section describes it narrowing from 0.23 for Mistral down to 0.02 for Qwen-14B, but this ignores the LLaMA data point which has a gap of 0.312, breaking the monotonic trend the paper implies. The actual progression is Mistral at 0.23, then LLaMA jumps to 0.31, drops to 0.13 for Qwen-7B, and finally reaches 0.02 for Qwen-14B, which contradicts the claim that the gap is largest for weaker models.

[Director 指令] **三个数字不一致修正**

**Issue A: κ=0.41 → 0.46**
process table (appendix:636) 的 Mistral-7B Ans. κ=0.460 是正确值。修正 3 处：
- abstract.tex:5: "answer-level Fleiss' κ (0.41)" → "(0.46)"
- introduction.tex:18: "answer-level κ (0.41)" → "(0.46)"
- analysis.tex:58: "answer-level κ = 0.41" → "= 0.46"

同时检查 introduction.tex:37 的 κ range "(0.45–0.74)" 是否仍与修正后一致。

**Issue B: Table 1 caption 54.41% → 55.88%**
experiments.tex:26 caption: "from Mistral-7B (54.41\% SC)" → "(55.88\% SC)"
理由：SC baseline 必须用 corrected tiebreaking 值。

**Issue C: cosine-κ gap 趋势非单调**
analysis.tex:58: "gap narrows from 0.23 (Mistral) to 0.02 (Qwen-14B)" 需修正。

完整数据：Mistral 0.230, LLaMA 0.312, Qwen-7B 0.132, Qwen-14B 0.022。趋势非单调。

改为："The gap ranges from 0.31 (LLaMA-3.1-8B) to 0.02 (Qwen2.5-14B), broadly decreasing with model capability but with notable variation across families."

同时检查 introduction.tex:37 如有 "gap is largest for weaker models" 类表述，需改为 "gap generally decreases with capability"。

修完编译确认。

```text
4	We identify \emph{symbolic confirmation bias} as the root cause: on incorrect problems, 83.3\% of self-extracted constraints support the wrong majority answer (bias ratio $4.97\times$), and 94\% of errors overlap with SC.
5	Process-level analysis reveals a deeper bottleneck: chain-of-thought cosine similarity ($0.69$) far exceeds answer-level Fleiss' $\kappa$ ($0.41$), indicating that traces share reasoning processes even when they diverge on answers.
6	Twenty-seven same-model remediation strategies spanning fifteen families all fail, revealing a persistent independence-accuracy trade-off at the 7B--32B scale: methods that increase trace independence destroy accuracy (Debate: $\kappa = 0.15$, $-18.6$\,pp), while methods preserving accuracy cannot break the correlation floor ($\kappa \geq 0.40$ across three model families).

57	\end{equation}
58	where $\mathbf{v}_i^q$ is the TF-IDF vector of trace $t_i$ for question $q$. On Mistral-7B FOLIO ($n = 204$), mean ProcessSim is $0.69$, far exceeding answer-level $\kappa = 0.41$. The process--answer correlation is model-strength dependent: $r = -0.06$ ($p = 0.36$) on Mistral-7B, where answer diversity does not reflect reasoning diversity (Appendix Figure~\ref{fig:process-kappa}), rising to $r = +0.24$ ($p < 0.001$) on Qwen2.5-14B. This pattern generalizes across four families (Table~\ref{tab:cross-model-process}): the cosine--$\kappa$ gap narrows from $0.23$ (Mistral) to $0.02$ (Qwen-14B), meaning answer-level $\kappa$ already captures the bottleneck for strong models, while process-$\kappa$ reveals hidden homogeneity in weaker models where answer diversity masks process convergence. In all families, interventions targeting answer diversity (temperature scaling, diverse prompting) cannot alter the underlying reasoning paths.

The process--answer correlation is model-strength dependent: $r = -0.06$ ($p = 0.36$) on Mistral-7B, where answer diversity does not reflect reasoning diversity (Appendix Figure~\\ref{fig:process-kappa}), rising to $r = +0.24$ ($p < 0.001$) on Qwen2.5-14B. This pattern generalizes across four families (Table~\\ref{tab:cross-model-process}): the cosine--$\\kappa$ gap narrows from $0.23$ (Mistral) to $0.02$ (Qwen-14B), meaning answer-level $\\kappa$ already captures the bottleneck for strong models, while process-$\\kappa$ reveals hidden homogeneity in weaker models where answer diversity masks process convergence. In all families, interventions targeting answer diversity (temperature scaling, diverse prompting) cannot alter the underlying reasoning paths.\n\n",

Z3 introduces a \\emph{sound}, non-neural channel that \\emph{guarantees} logical consistency given well-formed constraints, making self-extraction under formal verification a non-trivial test case. We show that even formal verification inherits the model's bias, revealing process-level homogeneity invisible to answer-only metrics.\n\nOracle controls confirm the mechanism is sound ($+29.90$\\,pp Mistral-7B, $+14.22$\\,pp Qwen-14B on FOLIO, $p < 0.001$; \\S\\ref{sec:oracle}), yet self-extraction captures only ${\\sim}$12\\% of this ceiling.\nThe central finding is a persistent independence-accuracy trade-off: Debate reduces $\\kappa$ to 0.15 but collapses accuracy by $-18.6$\\,pp; other methods cluster at $\\kappa \\approx 0.40$--$0.47$, forming a same-model ceiling across three families (\\S\\ref{sec:remediation}).\nA cross-architecture proof-of-concept escapes the mirage: DeBERTa NLI yields $+3.50$\\,pp on ProofWriter ($p = 0.013$; $+10.67$\\,pp at $w{=}5$, $p < 0.001$), confirmed across three NLI architectures (\\S\\ref{sec:cross-arch}).\n\nOur contributions are:\n\\begin{enumerate}[nosep,leftmargin=*]\n\\item \\textbf{Symbolic Confirmation Bias.} On incorrect problems, 83.3\\% of self-extracted constraints support the wrong majority answer (bias ratio $4.97\\times$), and 94\\% of errors overlap with SC---even under formal Z3-checked verification (\\S\\ref{sec:confirmation-bias}).\n\n\\item \\textbf{Independence-Accuracy Trade-off.} Same-model $\\kappa \\geq 0.40$ across four methods and three model families; twenty-seven remediation strategies (fifteen families) fail. A cross-architecture NLI verifier yields significant gains on two of four generators across model families ($+3.50$\\,pp Mistral-7B, $p{=}0.013$; $+4.17$\\,pp LLaMA-3.1-8B, $p{=}0.0035$; both at $w{=}3$), suggesting the ceiling is escapable (\\S\\ref{sec:remediation}, \\S\\ref{sec:cross-arch}).\n\n\\item \\textbf{Process-Level Independence.} Across four models from three families, CoT cosine similarity ($0.69$--$0.79$) exceeds answer-level $\\kappa$ ($0.45$--$0.74$) in every case; the gap is largest for weaker models and narrows with capability, but process homogeneity persists across all architectures (\\S\\ref{sec:process-kappa}).\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\\centering\n\\small\n\\resizebox{\\columnwidth}{!}{\\begin{tikzpicture}[\n    node distance=0.3cm and 0.1cm,\n    box/.style={draw, rounded corners=2pt, minimum height=0.55cm,\n                text width=1.2cm, align=center, font=\\scriptsize},\n    arr/.style={-{Stealth[length=4pt]}, thick},\n    darr/.style={-{Stealth[length=4pt]}, thick, densely dashed},\n    lbl/.style={font=\\scriptsize, text=gray!70!black},\n    ibottle/.style={draw=red!70!black, densely dashed, rounded corners=3pt,\n                    inner sep=3pt},\n]\n\\node[box] (q) {Question $q$};\n\\node[box, right=of q] (sample) {Sample $K$\\\\traces};\n\\node[box, right=of sample] (extract) {Extract logical\\\\constraints};\n\\node[box, right=of extract] (dedup) {Dedup.\\ +\\\\weight};\n\\node[box, right=of dedup] (maxsat) {MAX-SAT\\\\(Z3)};\n\n\\node[box, below=0.7cm of maxsat, fill=gray!12] (ans) {Answer $a^*$};\n\\node[box, below=0.7cm of sample, fill=gray!12] (sc) {Majority\\\\vote};\n\n\\draw[arr] (q) -- (sample);\n\\draw[arr] (sample) -- (extract);\n\\draw[arr] (extract) -- (dedup);\n\\draw[arr] (dedup) -- (maxsat);\n\\draw[arr] (maxsat) -- (ans);\n\\draw[arr] (sample) -- node[lbl, right, yshift=0pt] {SC} (sc);\n\n\\node[lbl, above=0.01cm of maxsat] {SICA};\n\n\\node[ibottle, fit=(sample)(extract), label={[font=\\scriptsize\\itshape, text=red!70!black]above:Independence Bottleneck}] {};\n\n\\draw[darr, gray!60] ([xshift=-0.1cm]dedup.south) -- ++(0,-0.35) node[lbl, below, yshift=-0.05cm] {oracle: gold FOL};\n\\end{tikzpicture}}\n\\caption{The SICA pipeline.

On Mistral-7B FOLIO ($n = 204$), when SICA errs, 83.3\\% of extracted constraints support the incorrect majority answer---a bias ratio of $4.97\\times$ (Table~\\ref{tab:cross-model-bias}). Consequently, 94\\% of SICA errors overlap with SC errors. The MAX-SAT solver rejects only 3.4\\% of constraints on average, confirming degeneration (Eq.~\\ref{eq:degenerate}).\n\nThe causal chain is: the model generates an answer, then extracts logical constraints consistent with it. Constraints use trace-specific variable names (56.4\\% zero cross-answer variable overlap), so MAX-SAT retains nearly all and aggregation reduces to weighted majority voting. Confirmation bias generalizes across families: $4.97\\times$ (Mistral), $3.93\\times$ (Qwen-14B), and $2.88\\times$ (LLaMA), all exceeding $1.0$ (Table~\\ref{tab:cross-model-bias}). Bias intensifies along reasoning steps: late-step constraints (step $\\geq 7$) exhibit 27.2\\% conclusion leakage vs.\\ 22.0\\% for early steps (Fisher $p = 3 \\times 10^{-6}$); SICA restricted to late-only constraints degrades by $-10.3$\\,pp (Appendix~\\ref{app:error-categorization}).\n\n\n\\subsection{Process-Level Independence}\n\\label{sec:process-kappa}\n\nAnswer-level $\\kappa$ may underestimate the independence bottleneck: two traces can follow nearly identical reasoning yet reach different final answers, causing $\\kappa$ to treat them as disagreeing. We define process similarity as the mean pairwise cosine similarity of TF-IDF trace representations:\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{eq:process-sim}\n\\text{ProcessSim}(q) = \\frac{2}{K(K{-}1)} \\sum_{i < j} \\cos(\\mathbf{v}_i^q, \\mathbf{v}_j^q),\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $\\mathbf{v}_i^q$ is the TF-IDF vector of trace $t_i$ for question $q$. On Mistral-7B FOLIO ($n = 204$), mean ProcessSim is $0.69$, far exceeding answer-level $\\kappa = 0.41$. The process--answer correlation is model-strength dependent: $r = -0.06$ ($p = 0.36$) on Mistral-7B, where answer diversity does not reflect reasoning diversity (Appendix Figure~\\ref{fig:process-kappa}), rising to $r = +0.24$ ($p < 0.001$) on Qwen2.5-14B. This pattern generalizes across four families (Table~\\ref{tab:cross-model-process}): the cosine--$\\kappa$ gap narrows from $0.23$ (Mistral) to $0.02$ (Qwen-14B), meaning answer-level $\\kappa$ already captures the bottleneck for strong models, while process-$\\kappa$ reveals hidden homogeneity in weaker models where answer diversity masks process convergence. In all families, interventions targeting answer diversity (temperature scaling, diverse prompting) cannot alter the underlying reasoning paths.\n\n\n\\subsection{Supporting Diagnostics}\n\\label{sec:diagnostics}\n\nFurther diagnostics---constraint ablation, discriminativeness, entropy decomposition, and hyperparameter sensitivity---confirm the mechanism (Appendices~\\ref{app:extraction}--\\ref{app:entropy}). One positive signal emerges: Z3-based semantic deduplication removes ${\\sim}$10\\% additional constraints beyond syntactic dedup and yields a small but significant improvement ($p = 0.013$), indicating that the formal verification mechanism itself adds value---but this gain is overwhelmed by confirmation bias ($\\text{BR} = 4.97\\times$).\n\n\n\\subsection{Remediation Analysis}\n\\label{sec:remediation}\n\\label{sec:interventions}\n\nTwenty-seven remediation strategies all produce neutral-to-negative results (Figure~\\ref{fig:interventions-summary}; Tables~\\ref{tab:method_interventions}, \\ref{tab:remediation}, \\ref{tab:additional_interventions}). At the method level, Debate achieves the lowest $\\kappa = 0.15$ but collapses accuracy by $-18.6$\\,pp ($p < 0.001$); all other methods cluster at $\\kappa \\approx 0.40$--$0.47$, confirming a same-model ceiling: methods that increase independence destroy accuracy, and vice versa (Appendix Table~\\ref{tab:kappa_generalization}).\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.85\\columnwidth]{figures/fig_app_interventions_summary.pdf}\n\\caption{Summary of 27 intervention strategies grouped by category.

    "originalFile": "\\section{Introduction}\\label{sec:introduction}\n\nTest-time computation scaling through multiple reasoning samples has emerged as a practical alternative to scaling model parameters \\citep{snell2025scaling, guo2025deepseekr1}.\nThe dominant aggregation strategy, Self-Consistency (SC) \\citep{wang2023sc}, samples $K$ chain-of-thought traces and selects the majority answer.\nSC is simple, model-agnostic, and effective---but it is hitting a ceiling.\n\\citet{loo2025reevaluating} demonstrate that gains from increasing $K$ plateau and even decline for strong models.\nThe gap between SC's theoretical promise (independent correct voters converge to truth) and its practical behavior (saturating gains) points to a structural mismatch: same-model traces carry correlated errors, and majority voting has no mechanism to correct shared bias.\n\nConfidence-weighted \\citep{taubenfeld2025cisc} and universal \\citep{chen2024usc} extensions alleviate this, but the core limitation persists.\nRecent neuro-symbolic methods \\citep{pan2023logiclm, olausson2023linc, xu2026dylos, li2025aristotle, wang2025fover, luo2025logicagent} report gains on logical reasoning but introduce components beyond the reasoning model.\nA simpler question precedes these: can the \\emph{same} model extract useful formal constraints from its own traces---a zero-cost upgrade requiring no additional model or data?\nNo prior work has systematically evaluated this.\n\nWe ground our analysis in the Condorcet Jury Theorem (CJT) \\citep{condorcet1785}: if $K$ independent voters each answer correctly with probability $p > 0.5$, the majority converges to truth \\citep{austensmith1996}.\nWhen independence fails \\citep{ladha1992correlated}, additional samples carry diminishing information.\nMeasuring inter-trace agreement with Fleiss' $\\kappa$ \\citep{fleiss1971kappa}, we find $\\kappa = 0.21$--$0.82$ across instruction-tuned conditions, yielding Effective-$K = 1.20$--$3.62$ for nominal $K = 12$: traces beyond a dozen add negligible independent information (\\S\\ref{sec:effective-k}).\nThe bottleneck runs deeper than answer-level agreement suggests.\nChain-of-thought cosine similarity ($0.69$) far exceeds answer-level $\\kappa$ ($0.46$), revealing that traces share reasoning processes even when they diverge on final answers (\\S\\ref{sec:process-kappa}).\nWhen the same model extracts logical constraints from these correlated traces, the constraints exhibit \\emph{symbolic confirmation bias}: on problems where the model errs, 83.3\\% of self-extracted constraints support the wrong majority answer (bias ratio $4.97\\times$), and 94\\% of errors overlap with SC (\\S\\ref{sec:confirmation-bias}).\nSelf-extraction cannot supply the independent signal that CJT requires.\n\nWe study this through Symbolic Invariant Consensus Aggregation (SICA): extract logical constraints from each of $K$ reasoning traces, deduplicate by syntactic equivalence, and select the answer best supported by a weighted partial MAX-SAT solution via Z3 \\citep{demoura2008z3} (\\S\\ref{sec:pipeline}; Figure~\\ref{fig:pipeline}).\nWe evaluate SICA across six models (7B--32B), three reasoning domains (FOLIO \\citep{han2022folio}, ProofWriter \\citep{tafjord2021proofwriter}, LogiQA \\citep{liu2020logiqa}), and over 3,000 condition-evaluations with four-seed replication (Table~\\ref{tab:main_results}).\nTwenty-seven remediation strategies spanning fifteen families all produce neutral or negative results, confirming the bottleneck persists at the 7B--32B scale.\nPrior work establishes that LLMs cannot self-correct without external feedback \\citep{huang2024selfcorrect, stechly2025selfverification}, but concerns natural-language self-correction. Z3 introduces a \\emph{sound}, non-neural channel that \\emph{guarantees} logical consistency given well-formed constraints, making self-extraction under formal verification a non-trivial test case. We show that even formal verification inherits the model's bias, revealing process-level homogeneity invisible to answer-only metrics.\n\nOracle controls confirm the mechanism is sound ($+29.90$\\,pp Mistral-7B, $+14.22$\\,pp Qwen-14B on FOLIO, $p < 0.001$; \\S\\ref{sec:oracle}), yet self-extraction captures only ${\\sim}$12\\% of this ceiling.\nThe central finding is a persistent independence-accuracy trade-off: Debate reduces $\\kappa$ to 0.15 but collapses accuracy by $-18.6$\\,pp; other methods cluster at $\\kappa \\approx 0.40$--$0.47$, forming a same-model ceiling across three families (\\S\\ref{sec:remediation}).\nA cross-architecture proof-of-concept escapes the mirage: DeBERTa NLI yields $+3.50$\\,pp on ProofWriter ($p = 0.013$; $+10.67$\\,pp at $w{=}5$, $p < 0.001$), confirmed across three NLI architectures (\\S\\ref{sec:cross-arch}).\n\nOur contributions are:\n\\begin{enumerate}[nosep,leftmargin=*]\n\\item \\textbf{Symbolic Confirmation Bias.} On incorrect problems, 83.3\\% of self-extracted constraints support the wrong majority answer (bias ratio $4.97\\times$), and 94\\% of errors overlap with SC---even under formal Z3-checked verification (\\S\\ref{sec:confirmation-bias}).\n\n\\item \\textbf{Independence-Accuracy Trade-off.} Same-model $\\kappa \\geq 0.40$ across four methods and three model families; twenty-seven remediation strategies (fifteen families) fail. A cross-architecture NLI verifier yields significant gains on two of four generators across model families ($+3.50$\\,pp Mistral-7B, $p{=}0.013$; $+4.17$\\,pp LLaMA-3.1-8B, $p{=}0.0035$; both at $w{=}3$), suggesting the ceiling is escapable (\\S\\ref{sec:remediation}, \\S\\ref{sec:cross-arch}).\n\n\\item \\textbf{Process-Level Independence.} Across four models from three families, CoT cosine similarity ($0.69$--$0.79$) exceeds answer-level $\\kappa$ ($0.45$--$0.74$) in every case; the gap is largest for weaker models and narrows with capability, but process homogeneity persists across all architectures (\\S\\ref{sec:process-kappa}).\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\\centering\n\\small\n\\resizebox{\\columnwidth}{!}{\\begin{tikzpicture}[\n    node distance=0.3cm and 0.1cm,\n    box/.style={draw, rounded corners=2pt, minimum height=0.55cm,\n                text width=1.2cm, align=center, font=\\scriptsize},\n    arr/.style={-{Stealth[length=4pt]}, thick},\n    darr/.style={-{Stealth[length=4pt]}, thick, densely dashed},\n    lbl/.style={font=\\scriptsize, text=gray!70!black},\n    ibottle/.style={draw=red!70!black, densely dashed, rounded corners=3pt,\n                    inner sep=3pt},\n]\n\\node[box] (q) {Question $q$};\n\\node[box, right=of q] (sample) {Sample $K$\\\\traces};\n\\node[box, right=of sample] (extract) {Extract logical\\\\constraints};\n\\node[box, right=of extract] (dedup) {Dedup.\\ +\\\\weight};\n\\node[box, right=of dedup] (maxsat) {MAX-SAT\\\\(Z3)};\n\n\\node[box, below=0.7cm of maxsat, fill=gray!12] (ans) {Answer $a^*$};\n\\node[box, below=0.7cm of sample, fill=gray!12] (sc) {Majority\\\\vote};\n\n\\draw[arr] (q) -- (sample);\n\\draw[arr] (sample) -- (extract);\n\\draw[arr] (extract) -- (dedup);\n\\draw[arr] (dedup) -- (maxsat);\n\\draw[arr] (maxsat) -- (ans);\n\\draw[arr] (sample) -- node[lbl, right, yshift=0pt] {SC} (sc);\n\n\\node[lbl, above=0.01cm of maxsat] {SICA};\n\n\\node[ibottle, fit=(sample)(extract), label={[font=\\scriptsize\\itshape, text=red!70!black]above:Independence Bottleneck}] {};\n\n\\draw[darr, gray!60] ([xshift=-0.1cm]dedup.south) -- ++(0,-0.35) node[lbl, below, yshift=-0.05cm] {oracle: gold FOL};\n\\end{tikzpicture}}\n\\caption{The SICA pipeline.

[Director 指令] **两个任务并行：**

**任务 1 (P1): Spawn DRC Worker — Disagreement-Routed Cascade Pilot (CPU, westd-25068)**

用现有 Mistral-7B ProofWriter 600 题的 SC traces + NLI logits 做 cascade pilot。

概念：
- 对每个问题 Q，计算 SC 12 traces 的 agreement κ_Q（Fleiss' kappa 或简单 majority fraction）
- κ_Q > τ（高共识，简单题）→ 直接用 SC 结果（不调 NLI）
- κ_Q < τ（低共识，难题）→ 调用 NLI verifier，用 SC+NLI combo 决策

实验设计：
- τ ∈ {0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9}
- 对每个 τ 报告：
  - DRC accuracy（cascade 后的准确率）
  - NLI invocation率（多少比例题目需要 NLI）
  - vs SC-only accuracy 和 full combo accuracy 对比
- 画 Pareto front: x=NLI 调用率, y=accuracy

数据源：
- SC traces: `/root/symb_invariant_consensus/results/` 下 Mistral PW 相关目录
- NLI predictions: `/root/symb_invariant_consensus/results/dir_j3_nli_multi_verifier/` 或 `/root/symb_invariant_consensus/results/push_b_stronger_nli_verifier/`
- 如果找不到现成 per-question NLI prediction，用 DeBERTa-large standalone predictions 重新生成

输出：
- `/root/symb_invariant_consensus/results/drc_cascade_pilot/results.json`
- `/root/symb_invariant_consensus/results/drc_cascade_pilot/pareto_front.pdf`

**任务 2: 检查 V13 Paper Agent 进度**

Paper Agent 正在做 Discussion 扩展。完成后立即通知我，我要 submit V13 for review。不要等其他任何东西。

SSH 到 westd-25068，探索数据目录结构\n2. 加载 SC traces，计算每题 per-question agreement（majority fraction）\n3. 加载或生成 NLI predictions\n4. 加载 gold labels\n5. 实现 cascade 逻辑：\n   ```python\n   for q in questions:\n       agreement = max(Counter(traces[q]).values()) / K\n       if agreement > tau:\n           pred = sc_answer[q]\n       else:\n           pred = combo_answer[q]  # SC+NLI weighted, w=3\n   ```\n6. 对每个 τ 计算 accuracy 和 NLI invocation rate\n7. 画 Pareto front（x=NLI invocation rate, y=accuracy）\n8. 保存结果\n\n### 输出\n- `/root/symb_invariant_consensus/results/drc_cascade_pilot/results.json`：包含每个 τ 的 accuracy, NLI rate, 以及 SC-only 和 full-combo baselines\n- `/root/symb_invariant_consensus/results/drc_cascade_pilot/pareto_front.pdf`\n\n### Combo 逻辑 (w=3)\n对于触发 NLI 的问题：\n- SC 给出 12 个 answer votes\n- NLI 给出一个 prediction\n- Combo: NLI prediction 的 vote 权重为 w（相当于加 w 个额外 votes），取加权后的 majority\n\n### 注意\n- SC baseline 是 39.33%（corrected, alphabetical tiebreaking）\n- Full combo (w=3) baseline 是 42.83%\n- 用 matplotlib 画图，保存 PDF\n- 结果 JSON 格式清晰，方便后续分析\n",

On Mistral-7B FOLIO ($n = 204$), when SICA errs, 83.3\\% of extracted constraints support the incorrect majority answer---a bias ratio of $4.97\\times$ (Table~\\ref{tab:cross-model-bias}). Consequently, 94\\% of SICA errors overlap with SC errors. The MAX-SAT solver rejects only 3.4\\% of constraints on average, confirming degeneration (Eq.~\\ref{eq:degenerate}).\n46\t\n47\tConfirmation bias generalizes across families: $4.97\\times$ (Mistral), $3.93\\times$ (Qwen-14B), and $2.88\\times$ (LLaMA), all exceeding $1.0$ (Table~\\ref{tab:cross-model-bias}). Constraints use trace-specific variable names (56.4\\% zero cross-answer overlap), collapsing aggregation to weighted majority voting. Bias intensifies along reasoning steps (27.2\\% late-step conclusion leakage vs.\\ 22.0\\% early, Fisher $p = 3 \\times 10^{-6}$; Appendix~\\ref{app:error-categorization}).\n48\t\n49\t\n50\t\\subsection{Process-Level Independence}\n51\t\\label{sec:process-kappa}\n52\t\n53\tAnswer-level $\\kappa$ may underestimate the independence bottleneck: two traces can follow nearly identical reasoning yet reach different final answers, causing $\\kappa$ to treat them as disagreeing. We define process similarity as the mean pairwise cosine similarity of TF-IDF trace representations:\n54\t\\begin{equation}\n55\t\\label{eq:process-sim}\n56\t\\text{ProcessSim}(q) = \\frac{2}{K(K{-}1)} \\sum_{i < j} \\cos(\\mathbf{v}_i^q, \\mathbf{v}_j^q),\n57\t\\end{equation}\n58\twhere $\\mathbf{v}_i^q$ is the TF-IDF vector of trace $t_i$ for question $q$. On Mistral-7B FOLIO ($n = 204$), mean ProcessSim is $0.69$, far exceeding answer-level $\\kappa = 0.46$: traces share reasoning processes even when they diverge on answers. This generalizes across four families (Table~\\ref{tab:cross-model-process}): the cosine--$\\kappa$ gap ranges from $0.31$ (LLaMA) to $0.02$ (Qwen-14B), revealing that process-$\\kappa$ uncovers hidden homogeneity in weaker models where answer diversity masks process convergence. Interventions targeting answer diversity (temperature scaling, diverse prompting) cannot alter the underlying reasoning paths.\n59\t\n60\t\n61\t\\subsection{Supporting Diagnostics}\n62\t\\label{sec:diagnostics}\n63\t\n64\tFurther diagnostics confirm the mechanism (Appendices~\\ref{app:extraction}--\\ref{app:entropy}). One positive signal emerges: Z3-based semantic deduplication removes ${\\sim}$10\\% additional constraints beyond syntactic dedup and yields a small but significant gain ($p = 0.013$), confirming that the formal channel adds value when redundancy is reduced. The bottleneck is not Z3 but the quality of input constraints: confirmation bias ($\\text{BR} = 4.97\\times$) overwhelms the deduplication gain.\n65\t\n66\t\n67\t\\subsection{Remediation Analysis}\n68\t\\label{sec:remediation}\n69\t\\label{sec:interventions}\n70\t\n71\tTwenty-seven remediation strategies all produce neutral-to-negative results (Figure~\\ref{fig:interventions-summary}; Tables~\\ref{tab:method_interventions}, \\ref{tab:remediation}, \\ref{tab:additional_interventions}). At the method level, Debate achieves the lowest $\\kappa = 0.15$ but collapses accuracy by $-18.6$\\,pp ($p < 0.001$); all other methods cluster at $\\kappa \\approx 0.40$--$0.47$, confirming a same-model ceiling: methods that increase independence destroy accuracy, and vice versa (Appendix Table~\\ref{tab:kappa_generalization}).\n72\t\n73\t\\begin{figure}[t]\n74\t\\centering\n75\t\\includegraphics[width=0.85\\columnwidth]{figures/fig_app_interventions_summary.pdf}\n76\t\\caption{Summary of 27 intervention strategies grouped by category.

DRC cascade pilot completed with clear results. Let me summarize and report to Director.

Key findings:
- τ=0.7 is the sweet spot: 38.8% NLI invocations → 45.33% accuracy (93% of full combo's gain)
- τ=0.3 doesn't work: all questions have agreement > 0.333, NLI never triggers
- τ=0.9 is wasteful: 75.8% NLI invocations → only +0.5pp more than τ=0.7

Now report to Director.

[Director 指令] **P0 紧急调查：NLI combo tiebreaking 一致性**

Reviewer 发现 DRC cascade pilot 中 combo_w3 使用 alphabetical tiebreaking 得到 46.0% (276/600)，但 exp-090 的 combo_w3 用 Counter.most_common()（非确定性 tiebreaking）得到 42.83% (257/600)。差 19 题 = 3.17pp。

论文 SC baseline 已全部统一为 alphabetical tiebreaking。**combo 也应该用 alphabetical tiebreaking 以保持一致。**

请立即调查：

1. **确认 exp-090 (direction_r_deberta_proofwriter.py) 的 tiebreaking 方法**：是 Counter.most_common()（非确定性）还是 alphabetical？

2. **确认所有 4 个 NLI combo 实验（exp-090 Mistral PW, exp-091 Qwen3 PW, exp-092 LLaMA PW, exp-093 Qwen3-T PW）的 tiebreaking 方法是否一致**。

3. **如果任何实验使用非 alphabetical tiebreaking**：用 alphabetical tiebreaking 重算 combo_w1/w3/w5 的 accuracy + McNemar p-value，对比当前论文数字。

4. **同时检查 FOLIO NLI combo 实验（如有）的 tiebreaking**。

这可能影响论文 abstract/intro/solutions 的核心数字。**先报告调查结果，不要直接改论文。**

  "task_prompt": "**P0 紧急调查：NLI combo tiebreaking 一致性**\n\n## 背景\n论文的 SC baseline 已全部统一为 alphabetical tiebreaking。但 Reviewer 发现 DRC cascade pilot 的 combo_w3 用 alphabetical tiebreaking 得到 46.0% (276/600)，而论文报告的 combo_w3 = 42.83% (257/600)，差 19 题 = 3.17pp。怀疑原始 NLI combo 实验使用了非确定性 tiebreaking（如 Python Counter.most_common()）。\n\n## 任务\n\n### Step 1: 找到 NLI combo 实验脚本\nSSH 到 westd-25068，找到以下实验的源代码：\n- exp-090: Mistral-7B ProofWriter NLI combo（应在 `/root/symb_invariant_consensus/` 下）\n- exp-091: Qwen3 PW\n- exp-092: LLaMA PW  \n- exp-093: Qwen3-T PW\n\n关键文件可能是：\n- `direction_r_deberta_proofwriter.py` 或类似名字\n- 搜索 `combo` / `nli` / `deberta` / `tiebreak` 关键词\n\n```bash\nfind /root/symb_invariant_consensus/ -name \"*.py\" | xargs grep -l \"combo\\|nli\\|deberta\" 2>/dev/null\n```\n\n### Step 2: 检查 tiebreaking 实现\n在找到的脚本中，搜索 tiebreaking 逻辑：\n```bash\ngrep -n \"most_common\\|tiebreak\\|sorted\\|alphabetical\\|Counter\" &lt;script_path>\n```\n\n确认是否使用：\n- `Counter.most_common()[0]`（非确定性，Python dict 顺序依赖）\n- `sorted()` + alphabetical（确定性）\n- 其他方式\n\n### Step 3: 检查所有 4 个实验的结果文件\n找到 exp-090 到 exp-093 的输出 JSON/CSV，确认它们使用的 combo accuracy 数字：\n```bash\nfind /root/symb_invariant_consensus/results/ -path \"*090*\" -o -path \"*091*\" -o -path \"*092*\" -o -path \"*093*\" -o -path \"*combo*\" -o -path \"*nli*\" | head -30\n```\n\n### Step 4: 如果发现非 alphabetical tiebreaking\n用 alphabetical tiebreaking 重算所有 combo 结果。写一个 Python 脚本：\n\n```python\n# 对每个问题：\n# 1. 加载 K=12 SC traces 的 answers\n# 2. 加载 NLI prediction\n# 3. 对于 w ∈ {1, 3, 5}：\n#    - 构建 weighted votes: SC vote counts + (w × NLI-supporting votes if NLI agrees)\n#    - Tiebreak: sorted(candidates)[0] (alphabetical)\n# 4. 计算 accuracy vs gold labels\n# 5. 计算 McNemar exact test vs SC (alphabetical tiebreaking, SC=39.33% for Mistral PW)\n```\n\n需要的数据：\n- SC traces: `/root/symb_invariant_consensus/results/` 下各模型 PW 目录\n- NLI predictions: `/root/symb_invariant_consensus/results/dir_j3_nli_multi_verifier/` 或 `push_b_stronger_nli_verifier/`\n- Gold labels: ProofWriter dataset\n\n### Step 5: 同时检查 FOLIO NLI combo\n如果有 FOLIO NLI combo 实验，同样检查 tiebreaking。\n\n### 输出\n将调查结果写入本地文件：\n`/home/ubuntu/.agent-ml-research-idea_gen_0513_3/projects/symb_invariant_consensus/artifacts/nli_tiebreaking_audit.json`\n\n格式：\n```json\n{\n  \"investigation\": {\n    \"script_path\": \"...\",\n    \"tiebreaking_method\": \"Counter.most_common() | alphabetical | other\",\n    \"code_snippet\": \"relevant lines...\"\n  },\n  \"experiments\": {\n    \"exp-090\": {\"current_combo_w3\": ..., \"corrected_combo_w3\": ..., \"delta\": ...},\n    ...\n  },\n  \"folio_combo\": { ... },\n  \"impact_summary\": \"...\"\n}\n```\n\n**关键：只调查和计算，不要修改论文。把完整结果报告回来。**",

<details><summary>Logged reasoning block</summary>

```text
Critical finding. The NLI combo experiments used `Counter.most_common()` (non-deterministic) while the paper's SC baseline uses alphabetical tiebreaking. The main impact:

- Mistral-7B PW combo w=3: 42.83% → 46.00% (+3.17pp), McNemar p: 0.0125 → 1.1e-05
- w=5: 50.00% → 50.33% (+0.33pp)
- w=1: no change in accuracy but 17 questions changed


- The combo results are significantly understated in the paper. I need to recalculate the deltas against the SC baseline—the w=3 improvement should be reported as +6.67pp rather than +3.50pp, and I need to flag this immediately to the Director with the full impact analysis. The FOLIO combo results shift with alphabetical tiebreaking—accuracy drops from 57.84% to 56.37%, a -1.47pp change—but I need to figure out which weight this applies to and verify the detailed breakdown from the artifact, since the worker's note doesn't specify.

This is a critical finding. Let me analyze the impact on the paper carefully:

**Current paper numbers (solutions.tex):**
- Mistral-7B PW combo w=1: +0.83pp (SC 39.33% → combo 40.17%) — unchanged ✓
- Mistral-7B PW combo w=3: +3.50pp (SC 39.33% → combo 42.83%) → should be +6.67pp (39.33% → 46.00%)
- Mistral-7B PW combo w=5: +10.67pp (SC 39.33% → combo 50.00%) → should be +11.00pp (39.33% → 50.33%)


The w=3 correction is massive—nearly doubling the reported improvement from 3.50pp to 6.67pp, which significantly changes the narrative around how much the ensemble approach helps at that weight setting.

I need to track down all the places this impacts: the abstract and introduction both cite the original 3.50pp figure, the solutions section has multiple mentions of this result with the old p-value, and Table 3 needs updating. The appendix also has the full NLI results that would be affected. There's a similar issue with FOLIO results that I need to check. I'm realizing the audit only verified w=1 for FOLIO, but the paper reports results at both w=1 and w=3—I need to check if those w=3 numbers came from a different script entirely. This is a significant discrepancy I should flag to the Director, along with the fact that experiments 091-093 require recomputation from a server the Worker couldn't access. I'm also starting to look at the Benjamini-Hochberg correction impact on the Mistral w=3 p-value.
