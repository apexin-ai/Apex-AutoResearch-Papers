1	\section{Theoretical Analysis}
2	\label{sec:theory}
3	
4	Sign misattribution is the more fundamental failure mechanism because it causes active divergence, not merely slow convergence. We derive the probability of incorrect gradient direction below; full proofs appear in Appendix~\ref{app:theory_full}.
5	
6	\textbf{Definition 1} (Locally correct action). \textit{An action $a_t$ is \textbf{locally correct} if it would receive positive advantage under an oracle that observes the full episode history $h_t$ and has access to the true action-value function. Equivalently,\footnote{This equivalence is approximate; it holds exactly when all trajectories within an episode are equally likely under the reference policy, and approximately under the mild assumption that policy drift remains small during early training.} window $k$ contains locally correct actions if replacing them (holding all other windows fixed) would decrease the probability of episode success.}
7	
8	\textbf{Proposition 1.} \textit{Under step-independent training with binary episode reward $R_{\text{episode}} \in \{0, r_+\}$, the probability that window $k$'s advantage $\hat{A}_k$ has the correct sign (aligned with local action quality) approaches the base success rate $p$ as the number of rollouts $K$ per group increases.}
9	
10	\textit{Proof sketch.} In a failed episode ($R_{\text{episode}} = 0$), all windows receive $R_k = 0$. If any rollout in the group succeeded, $\mu > 0$, so every window in the failed episode receives $\hat{A}_k < 0$---including windows with locally correct actions. The probability of receiving the wrong sign in a failed episode is $1 - (1-p)^{K-1}$ (at least one group member succeeded). As $K$ grows, this approaches $1-p$, and the overall probability of correct sign approaches $p$. \hfill$\square$
11	
12	The key distinction is temporal. Information loss (M1) imposes a constant ceiling determined by $h$; sign misattribution (M2) is cumulative---each wrong-sign gradient step erodes policy competence below that ceiling. A wrong-sign gradient moves the optimizer \textit{away} from good policies; a reduced-magnitude gradient from discounting ($\gamma^{(N-k)}$) still points toward good policies. Sign errors produce active divergence; magnitude errors merely slow convergence (Appendix~\ref{app:sign_fundamental}).
13	
14	\textbf{Proposition 2.}\label{prop:correct_sign} \textit{Let $p$ denote the episode success rate and $K$ the number of rollouts per group. Under step-independent training with binary episode reward, the fraction of gradient updates with correct sign is upper bounded by:}
15	\begin{equation}
16	P(\text{correct} \mid \text{update}) \leq \frac{p}{1 - (1-p)^{K}}
17	\label{eq:correct_conditional}
18	\end{equation}
19	
20	\textit{Derivation.} Three mutually exclusive cases determine gradient direction for a window with locally correct actions: (1)~episode succeeded (probability $p$): correct sign; (2)~episode failed but group contains a success (probability $(1{-}p)[1{-}(1{-}p)^{K-1}]$): wrong sign; (3)~entire group failed (probability $(1{-}p)^K$): zero gradient. Conditioning on non-zero gradient (Cases 1 and 2) yields Equation~\ref{eq:correct_conditional}. The bound is tight when episode success implies all constituent windows are locally correct; in practice, successful episodes may contain suboptimal windows, so the true fraction of correctly signed updates may be lower.
21	
22	At $p{=}12.5\%$, $K{=}8$, this yields an upper bound of 19.1\% on correctly signed gradient updates (Figure~\ref{fig:theory_curve}). In the large-$K$ limit, $P(\text{correct} \mid \text{update}) \to p$: ${\sim}87.5\%$ of updates for locally correct windows point in the wrong direction.
23	
24	\begin{figure}[t]
25	\centering
26	\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{fig_theory_curve.pdf}
27	\caption{Upper bound on the probability of correct gradient sign as a function of episode success rate $p$ (Proposition~2). At typical agent task success rates ($p < 0.2$, shaded), the majority of gradient updates carry incorrect sign regardless of group size $K$. At ALFWorld's baseline ($p{=}12.5\%$, $K{=}8$), at most 19.1\% of updates are correct. The dashed diagonal shows the large-$K$ limit $P_{\text{correct}} \to p$.}
28	\label{fig:theory_curve}
29	\end{figure}
30	
31	\paragraph{Severity scales with task difficulty.} Sign misattribution becomes \textit{more} severe as the task gets harder (Equation~\ref{eq:correct_conditional}): at $p{=}50\%$, $P(\text{correct} \mid \text{update}) \leq 50.2\%$; at $p{=}5\%$, at most 14.9\% of updates are correct. Multi-turn agent tasks with low baseline success rates are precisely where credit assignment matters most, yet where step-independent training produces the worst gradient signal. Increasing $K$ does not help: more updates occur (fewer all-fail groups), but each remains equally likely to carry the wrong sign.
32	
33	\paragraph{Reward saturation.} When all $K$ rollouts receive the same binary reward, $\sigma = 0$ and $\hat{A}_k = 0$, producing zero gradient. At $p{=}12.5\%$, $K{=}8$, the all-fail probability is $(1{-}p)^K \approx 34.4\%$; combined with the negligible all-success case ($p^K < 10^{-7}$), roughly one-third of batches yield no gradient at all. This compounds sign misattribution: of the ${\sim}66\%$ of batches that produce a gradient, at most 19.1\% have the correct sign. The effective learning rate is at most $0.66 \times 0.19 \approx 12.5\%$ of nominal---well below the regime where convergence guarantees hold.
34	
35	\paragraph{Cumulative divergence.} Sign misattribution produces a systematic gradient bias. Let $\theta^*$ denote an optimal policy parameterization. At each update, the expected gradient under step-independent training is:
36	\begin{equation}
37	\mathbb{E}[\nabla_\theta \mathcal{L}] = P_c \cdot g_+ + (1 - P_c) \cdot g_-
38	\label{eq:biased_gradient}
39	\end{equation}
40	where $P_c = P(\text{correct} \mid \text{update})$, $g_+$ points toward $\theta^*$, and $g_-$ points away. Empirical measurement from training logs confirms approximately comparable per-group advantage magnitudes ($|\hat{A}_{\text{correct}}|/|\hat{A}_{\text{wrong}}| \approx 1.32$). This ratio is measured at a single training snapshot (step~5); we cannot rule out that it varies substantially across training stages. The cumulative divergence argument requires only that $|\hat{A}_{\text{correct}}|$ and $|\hat{A}_{\text{wrong}}|$ remain comparable in order of magnitude, which is consistent with gradient update mechanics but warrants broader empirical verification. When $P_c < 0.5$ (which holds for $p < 0.5$; Equation~\ref{eq:correct_conditional}), the expected gradient points weakly away from good policies. The cumulative effect of this directional bias, amplified by the M1--M2 positive feedback loop (Section~\ref{sec:dual_mechanism}), drives progressive policy degradation: information loss (M1) caps $p$; lower $p$ increases wrong-sign frequency under M2, which further depresses $p$, producing the empirically observed collapse.
41	
42	Our experimental setting uses ternary reward ($r \in \{-0.1, 0, 1\}$) rather than binary. The binary bound (19.1\%) and the empirical credit agreement (52.1\%) measure different calibers of the same underlying failure---deterministic misattribution vs.\ near-random noise---both confirming that advantage sign carries insufficient information about local action quality (Appendix~\ref{app:nonbinary_extension}).

```text
1	\section{Method}
2	\label{sec:method}
3	
4	\subsection{Problem Formulation and GRPO}
5	\label{sec:problem_formulation}
6	
7	We model the multi-turn agent as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP)~\cite{kaelbling1998planning} where the policy $\pi_\phi(a_t \mid h_t)$ generates actions conditioned on interaction history $h_t = (o_1, a_1, \ldots, o_t)$. Episodes of $T$ steps terminate with binary reward $R \in \{0, r_+\}$ (our experiments use a penalty variant with $r_- = -0.1$ per invalid action; Section~\ref{sec:setup}). GRPO~\cite{shao2024deepseekmath} samples $K$ rollouts per task and computes group-relative advantages:
8	\begin{align}
9	\hat{A}_k &= \frac{R_k - \mu}{\sigma + \epsilon}, \notag \\
10	\mu &= \frac{1}{K}\sum_{j=1}^K R_j, \quad \sigma = \sqrt{\frac{1}{K}\sum_{j=1}^K (R_j - \mu)^2}
11	\label{eq:grpo_advantage}
12	\end{align}
13	GRPO is episode-level by design: each rollout receives one return and one advantage, with no inherent temporal discounting.
14	
15	\subsection{Step-Independent Windowing}
16	\label{sec:step_independent}
17	
18	Agent RL frameworks must reconcile GRPO's episode-level design with the memory constraints of long trajectories. RAGEN~\cite{ragen2025} introduces \textbf{step-independent training}: the trajectory is partitioned into non-overlapping $h$-step windows, each receiving a discounted return:
19	\begin{equation}
20	R_k = \gamma^{(N - k)} \cdot R_{\text{episode}}
21	\label{eq:step_return}
22	\end{equation}
23	where $N = \lceil T/h \rceil$ is the number of windows. Each window is optimized as an independent GRPO sample. This reduces sequence length from $O(T)$ to $O(h)$ and multiplies the effective batch size, but structurally alters credit assignment.
24	
25	\begin{figure*}[t]
26	\centering
27	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{fig_overview.pdf}
28	\caption{Step-independent windowing (left) partitions the trajectory into fixed windows, each optimized independently. This introduces two failure mechanisms: M1 (information loss) truncates context at window boundaries, and M2 (sign misattribution) assigns all windows the same advantage sign based on episode outcome. Episode-level training (right) treats the full trajectory as a single sample, eliminating both mechanisms.}
29	\label{fig:overview}
30	\end{figure*}
31	
32	\subsection{Dual Mechanism Analysis}
33	\label{sec:dual_mechanism}
34	
35	Two mechanisms jointly cause training failure under step-independent optimization.
36	
37	\subsubsection{Mechanism 1: Policy Information Loss}
38	\label{sec:m1_information_loss}
39	
40	Step-independent training truncates context at both inference and training time. The policy $\pi_\phi(a_t \mid h_{\text{window}_k})$ conditions on only the local $h$-step history, losing access to earlier observations. With $h{=}2$, a window at step~8 has no access to the outcome of an exploration action at step~4, so the policy cannot learn strategies spanning more than $h$ steps. This imposes a \textit{constant} performance ceiling: no amount of optimization can recover absent information.
41	
42	\subsubsection{Mechanism 2: Advantage Sign Misattribution}
43	\label{sec:m2_sign_misattribution}
44	
45	Group normalization under step-independent training produces advantages whose sign reflects the \textit{episode} outcome, not local action quality:
46	\begin{equation}
47	\text{sign}(\hat{A}_k) \approx \text{sign}(R_{\text{episode}} - \mu)
48	\label{eq:sign_correlation}
49	\end{equation}
50	In failed episodes ($R_{\text{episode}} = 0$), all windows receive negative advantages when $\mu > 0$, including windows with locally correct actions. Conversely, successful episodes reinforce all windows, including those with suboptimal actions. Unlike M1's constant ceiling, sign misattribution is \textit{cumulative}: each wrong-sign gradient step further erodes policy competence. The discount factor $\gamma^{(N-k)}$ introduces magnitude decay across positions, but sign errors are strictly more harmful: magnitude decay slows convergence, while sign errors cause active divergence.
51	
52	\subsection{Episode-Level Training}
53	\label{sec:episode_level}
54	
55	Episode-level training addresses both mechanisms by treating the complete trajectory as a single GRPO sample. The full history $h_t$ is available at every step (eliminating M1), and a single advantage $\hat{A}$ applies uniformly to all tokens (eliminating M2). Uniform reinforcement of successful trajectories preserves good sub-strategies; window-level sign errors actively destroy them. This is GRPO's original design; step-independent windowing is the deviation.
56	
57	\subsection{Factorial Experiment Design}
58	\label{sec:factorial_design}
59	
60	To separate the two mechanisms, we design a $2 \times 2$ factorial varying observation scope and advantage granularity: \textbf{Cell~A} (truncated $h{=}2$ + step-level advantage; both mechanisms active), \textbf{Cell~B} (truncated $h{=}2$ + episode-level advantage; only M1 active), \textbf{Cell~D} (full trajectory + episode-level advantage; neither active), and \textbf{Cell~C} (full trajectory + step-level advantage; only M2 active). Cell~C encountered persistent numerical instability across six hyperparameter configurations (Appendix~\ref{app:cell_c}); we therefore evaluate a partial 3-of-4 factorial. Comparing A vs.\ B isolates sign misattribution; comparing B vs.\ D isolates information loss.

1	\section{Experiments}
2	\label{sec:experiments}
3	
4	Step-independent training collapses while episode-level training succeeds; a factorial design separates the two mechanisms; and window size $h$ modulates severity.
5	
6	\subsection{Setup}
7	\label{sec:setup}
8	
9	We evaluate on ALFWorld~\cite{shridhar2021alfworld}, a text-based household environment with six task types requiring sequential reasoning over up to 50 steps. The environment provides ternary reward: $R \in \{r_-, 0, r_+\}$, where $r_- = -0.1$ per invalid action, $0$ for valid but unsuccessful actions, and $r_+$ for task success. Our theoretical analysis (Section~\ref{sec:theory}) assumes the simplified binary case ($R \in \{0, r_+\}$), which yields an upper bound on sign misattribution severity; Section~\ref{sec:sign_verification} validates this bound under both reward structures. The base policy is Qwen3-1.7B fine-tuned on expert demonstrations (SFT baseline: 12.5\% in-distribution). At this baseline success rate, Proposition~2 predicts the majority of gradient updates carry incorrect sign. All conditions use RAGEN~\cite{ragen2025} (v0.1, commit \texttt{3a6b48b})\footnote{Our implementation extends RAGEN v0.1 with episode-level training support. Code available upon acceptance.} with GRPO~\cite{shao2024deepseekmath} ($K{=}8$; full hyperparameters in Appendix~\ref{app:hyperparameters}). We report success rate on a 134-task OOD set (primary) and 32-task in-distribution set (secondary). Seed counts are noted per condition.
10	
11	\subsection{Factorial Mechanism Separation}
12	\label{sec:factorial_experiments}
13	
14	We implement the factorial design from Section~\ref{sec:factorial_design} with two seeds per condition. Cell~C (full observation, step-level advantage) would isolate M2 without M1, but we encountered persistent training instability in this configuration (Appendix~\ref{app:cell_c}). Cell~C's NaN divergence, qualitatively different from Cell~A's gradual collapse, suggests that information loss may have an unintended stabilizing effect on gradient variance, and that the M1--M2 interaction may be non-additive (Section~\ref{sec:discussion}).
15	
16	\subsection{Results}
17	\label{sec:results}
18	
19	Cell~A collapses in two phases (Table~\ref{tab:main_results}): task success drops to 0\% while action validity initially remains high, then continued sign misattribution destroys even basic formatting. % exp_id: hsweep_h2_seed1, hsweep_h2_seed2
20	Cell~B eliminates sign misattribution while retaining information loss: training success improves, but OOD generalization (5.97\%) remains near the SFT baseline (6.72\%), confirming that removing M2 alone bounds learning without causing degradation.% exp_id: factorial_h2_episodeadv_seed1, factorial_h2_episodeadv_seed2
21	Cell~D is the only condition that substantially exceeds the SFT baseline, with monotonic OOD improvement across both seeds.% exp_id: exp029_episode_level, exp029_seed3_ood_v2
22	The A$\to$B comparison isolates M2; the B$\to$D comparison isolates M1. Both mechanisms are necessary to explain the full failure pattern (Figure~\ref{fig:hsweep}a).

A credit assignment threshold between $h{=}10$ and $h{=}20$ separates collapse from recovery. Hatched bars indicate collapsed conditions.}

51	\paragraph{Window-size sweep.} Varying window size reveals a credit assignment threshold between $h{=}10$ and $h{=}20$ that separates collapse from recovery (Figure~\ref{fig:hsweep}b; seed~1). Below this threshold, all conditions collapse to 0\%; above it, success rate increases monotonically with window size. This threshold is observed in a single seed; multi-seed verification is needed to confirm its robustness.% exp_id: h_sweep_series, exp029_seed1
52	\label{sec:results_hsweep}
53	
54	\subsection{Sign Misattribution Verification}
55	\label{sec:sign_verification}
56	
57	We distinguish three metrics that each capture a different aspect of credit assignment quality:
58	
59	\textit{(1) Sign-episode correlation}: whether advantage sign tracks episode outcome (success/failure). Under pure binary reward (penalty${=}0$), this correlation is near-perfect at 99.6\% ($270/271$ non-zero windows across three evaluation iterations; Figure~\ref{fig:sign_misattribution}), directly confirming M2: advantage sign is almost entirely determined by episode outcome, not local action quality.\footnote{The single discordant window (1/271) arises when a low-return successful episode is grouped with higher-return successes; GRPO normalization assigns negative advantage despite positive return. This is a group-composition edge case, not a violation of the theoretical mechanism.} This is by construction under binary reward, since all windows in a successful episode share the same positive return.% exp_id: binary_credit_agreement_iter0
60	
61	\textit{(2) Credit agreement rate}: whether advantage sign matches local action quality, operationalized through action validity as a proxy for local correctness (Definition~1). Under step-independent training with penalty reward ($h{=}2$, $n{=}3{,}000$ windows), only 52.07\% of windows with valid actions receive positive advantage, marginally above random chance ($p{=}0.025$ vs.\ 50\%; Cohen's $h = 2\arcsin\sqrt{0.5207} - 2\arcsin\sqrt{0.5} \approx 0.041$, below the 0.2 small-effect threshold), confirming that credit agreement is effectively at chance, consistent with the theoretical prediction of near-random sign assignment. This near-random credit agreement shows that advantage sign carries almost no information about local action quality. Under pure binary reward, credit agreement drops further to 28\% ($n{=}271$), below random chance---advantage sign systematically punishes valid actions in failed episodes. Penalty reward partially breaks sign-episode correlation by introducing within-group variance, but the resulting signal remains too weak for meaningful credit assignment. This operationalization is conservative: successful episodes may contain suboptimal windows, making our validity label an upper bound on true local correctness. Even under this generous criterion, credit agreement remains near-random, strengthening the diagnosis.% exp_id: 7b_cell_a_h2
62	
63	\textit{(3) $P(\text{correct} \mid \text{update})$}: the theoretical upper bound from Proposition~2 ($\leq$19.1\% at $p{=}12.5\%$, $K{=}8$). This bounds the fraction of non-zero gradient updates with correct sign, a different quantity from the credit agreement rate, which conditions on action validity rather than gradient participation. The two metrics are complementary: Proposition~2 bounds worst-case gradient quality; credit agreement measures empirical signal strength.
64	
65	Combined with $\gamma{=}1.0$ collapse (Appendix~\ref{app:additional}), these measurements are consistent with sign misattribution as the primary contributor to training failure.
66	
67	\begin{figure}[t]
68	\centering
69	\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{fig_sign_misattribution.pdf}
70	\caption{Sign-episode correlation (binary reward, penalty${=}0$) vs.\ credit agreement rate (penalty reward). Under binary reward, advantage sign near-perfectly tracks episode outcome (99.6\%, $270/271$), confirming M2. Under penalty reward, credit agreement with local action quality drops to 52.1\% ($n{=}3{,}000$), near random chance (dashed line). These are distinct metrics: the former measures episode-level sign correlation, the latter measures local credit assignment quality.}
71	\label{fig:sign_misattribution}
72	\end{figure}
73	
74	\subsection{Episode-Level Training: Seed Variability}
75	\label{sec:seed_variability}
76	
77	Episode-level GRPO addresses the dual-mechanism failure, but training outcomes remain seed-dependent. We systematically evaluate $N{=}11$ random seeds under identical hyperparameters, revealing a $2{\times}2$ structure: \textit{training stability} (collapsed vs.\ non-collapsed) $\times$ \textit{OOD generalization} (stagnant vs.\ generalized).
78	
79	We define \textbf{collapsed} seeds as those where in-distribution success declines $>$50\% from peak and remains below baseline for $\geq$3 consecutive steps. \textbf{Non-collapsed} seeds are the complement. Among non-collapsed seeds, we further distinguish \textbf{generalized} (Fisher exact $p{<}0.01$ vs.\ SFT on the 134-task OOD set) from \textbf{stagnant} (not significant vs.\ SFT). Table~\ref{tab:seed_variability} reports results for each seed at its best-performing checkpoint.

81	\begin{table}[t]

83	\caption{Episode-level GRPO across 11 seeds (134 OOD tasks, $\tau{=}0.4$, best checkpoint per seed). Category: C=Collapsed, S=Non-collapsed (stagnant), G=Generalized (Fisher exact $p{<}0.01$ vs.\ SFT). Wilson 95\% CI. SFT baseline: 6.72\% (9/134). Seed2 achieves $p{=}0.03$ (Fisher exact, two-sided), falling outside the conservative $p{<}0.01$ threshold, and is classified as Stagnant.

109	\small All results are single-run evaluations at $\tau{=}0.4$; see Limitations for eval variance discussion.
110	\end{flushleft}
111	\end{table}
112	
113	Three distinct outcomes emerge (Table~\ref{tab:seed_variability}): roughly a quarter of seeds collapse with response length inflation (Appendix~\ref{app:response_length}), a third are stagnant with OOD performance indistinguishable from SFT, and a third generalize with significant OOD improvement. No collapsed seed generalizes, and training duration does not explain the gap between stagnant and generalized seeds. Stable training is necessary but not sufficient; the mechanism driving seed-dependent transfer remains an open question (Section~\ref{sec:discussion}).% exp_id: exp029 multi-seed series
114	
115	\subsection{Cross-Scale and Cross-Environment Verification}
116	\label{sec:cross_scale}
117	
118	A single-seed experiment on Qwen3-8B provides preliminary evidence that both failure and fix persist at scale. Cell~A collapses within two steps; Cell~D reaches 90.3\% OOD, substantially exceeding the SFT baseline (full results in Appendix~\ref{app:8b_results}). Restricting context to $h{=}2$ produces a large M1 gap, confirming that information loss remains severe at scale. Single-seed due to memory constraints. % exp_id: 8b_cell_c_episode_v9d, 8b_v9d_ood_eval_v5
119	Step-independent training also collapses on ScienceWorld~\cite{wang2022scienceworld}: Cell~A drops to 0\% throughout all 15 steps. Restricting context to $h{=}2$ produces a comparable M1 gap to the 8B ALFWorld setting, suggesting the pathology is environment-general.% exp_id: scienceworld_grpo_cell_a, sw_info_loss_bjb1

## Complete File Contents and Mathematical Formulations

I've successfully read all three files. Here are the complete contents with all mathematical equations and key definitions:

---

## 1. THEORETICAL_ANALYSIS.TEX

**Full Content:**

Lines 1-43 contain the complete theoretical section. Key mathematical elements:

**Definition 1 (Locally correct action):** An action $a_t$ is locally correct if it would receive positive advantage under an oracle with full episode history and access to the true action-value function. Window $k$ contains locally correct actions if replacing them (holding other windows fixed) would decrease episode success probability.

**Proposition 1:** Under step-independent training with binary episode reward $R_{\text{episode}} \in \{0, r_+\}$, the probability that window $k$'s advantage $\hat{A}_k$ has the correct sign approaches the base success rate $p$ as rollouts $K$ increase.

**Proposition 2** (labeled eq:correct_conditional):
$$P(\text{correct} \mid \text{update}) \leq \frac{p}{1 - (1-p)^{K}}$$

This is the primary theoretical bound: at $p=12.5\%$, $K=8$, yields 19.1% correctly signed updates.

**Equation 1** (labeled eq:sign_correlation):
$$\text{sign}(\hat{A}_k) \approx \text{sign}(R_{\text{episode}} - \mu)$$

**Equation 2** (labeled eq:biased_gradient):
$$\mathbb{E}[\nabla_\theta \mathcal{L}] = P_c \cdot g_+ + (1 - P_c) \cdot g_-$$

where $P_c = P(\text{correct} \mid \text{update})$, $g_+$ points toward optimal policy $\theta^*$, $g_-$ points away.

Additional empirical measurement: $|\hat{A}_{\text{correct}}|/|\hat{A}_{\text{wrong}}| \approx 1.32$

---

## 2. METHOD.TEX

**Full Content:**

Lines 1-61 contain the complete method section. Key formulations:

**GRPO Advantage** (Equations 1-2, labeled eq:grpo_advantage):
$$\hat{A}_k = \frac{R_k - \mu}{\sigma + \epsilon}$$
$$\mu = \frac{1}{K}\sum_{j=1}^K R_j, \quad \sigma = \sqrt{\frac{1}{K}\sum_{j=1}^K (R_j - \mu)^2}$$

**Step-independent windowing** (Equation 3, labeled eq:step_return):
$$R_k = \gamma^{(N - k)} \cdot R_{\text{episode}}$$
where $N = \lceil T/h \rceil$ is the number of windows.

**Factorial Design:** 2×2 design with four cells:
- **Cell A:** truncated $h=2$ + step-level advantage (M1+M2 active)
- **Cell B:** truncated $h=2$ + episode-level advantage (M1 only)
- **Cell C:** full trajectory + step-level advantage (M2 only) — encountered instability
- **Cell D:** full trajectory + episode-level advantage (neither mechanism)

---

## 3. EXPERIMENTS.TEX

**Full Content:**

Lines 1-120 contain the complete experiments section.

**Setup:**
- Environment: ALFWorld with up to 50 steps
- Ternary reward: $R \in \{r_-, 0, r_+\}$ where $r_- = -0.1$, $r_+ = 1$ for success
- Base policy: Qwen3-1.7B (SFT baseline 12.5%)
- RAGEN with GRPO ($K=8$)
- Evaluation: 134-task OOD set (primary), 32-task in-distribution set (secondary)

**Main Results** (Table 1):
- SFT baseline: 12.50% (in-dist), 6.72% (OOD)
- Cell A ($h=2$, step): 0% (in-dist), 0% (OOD)
- Cell B ($h=2$, episode): 18.75% (in-dist), 5.97% (OOD)
- Cell D (full, episode): 34.38% (in-dist), 17.16% (OOD)

**Sign Misattribution Verification** (three metrics):

1. **Sign-episode correlation:** 99.6% (270/271 windows) under binary reward—advantage sign determined by episode outcome, not local quality

2. **Credit agreement rate:** 52.07% under penalty reward ($h=2$, $n=3{,}000$ windows), marginally above random (50%), with Cohen's $h \approx 0.041$. Under pure binary reward: 28%, systematically below random.

3. **$P(\text{correct} \mid \text{update})$:** Theoretical bound ≤19.1% at $p=12.5\%$, $K=8$

**Seed Variability** (11-seed evaluation):
- Collapsed: 3 seeds (in-dist decline >50%)
- Stagnant: 5 seeds (non-significant vs. SFT)
- Generalized: 3 seeds (Fisher exact $p<0.01$ vs. SFT)

OOD generalization ranges: 8.21% to 30.60% across seeds, with 36% overall generalization rate among non-collapsed seeds.

**Cross-Scale Results:**
- Qwen3-8B: Cell A collapses within 2 steps; Cell D reaches 90.3% OOD
- ScienceWorld: Cell A drops to 0% across all 15 steps
