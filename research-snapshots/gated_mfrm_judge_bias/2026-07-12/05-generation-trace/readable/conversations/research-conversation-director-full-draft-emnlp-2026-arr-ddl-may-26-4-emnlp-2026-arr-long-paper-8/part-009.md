Looking at page 8: The conclusion section (§6) starts near the bottom of page 8, and the text reads:
"We introduced the Gated Many-Facet Rasch Model (G-MFRM), which jointly estimates model ability, judge severity, and contamination susceptibility. By formalizing judge-bias/contamination confounding as an omitted variable bias problem, we showed that sequential correction produces directional bias proportional to contamination levels; three-stage estimation with externally fixed exposure resolves this, with formal identifiability guarantees and quantified error propagation bounds. On Arena-Hard with eight models and six judges, G-MFRM is the only method to change the baseline"


ranking (τ = 0.857 vs. 0.786), producing the first joint diagnostic of per-model contamination susceptibility and per-judge severity.

I'm noticing the conclusion spills onto page 9 by about two lines. I need to trim more space here. Let me check what else is on page 8 — the experiments section wraps up, then Related Work takes a substantial chunk, followed by the Conclusion. I could compress the conclusion further to fit everything on page 8.

Let me try condensing by combining some of these ideas: I can merge the explanation of how G-MFRM works with the confounding problem it solves, then move directly to the Arena-Hard results and what makes this approach unique.

We introduced the Gated Many-Facet Rasch Model (G-MFRM), which jointly estimates model ability, judge severity, and contamination susceptibility by formalizing their confounding as an omitted variable bias problem and resolving it through three-stage estimation with externally fixed exposure. On Arena-Hard with eight models and six judges, G-MFRM is the only method to change the baseline ranking ($\tau = 0.857$ vs.\ $0.786$), producing the first joint diagnostic of per-model contamination susceptibility and per-judge severity.

On Arena-Hard with eight models and six judges, G-MFRM is the only method to change the baseline ranking ($\\tau = 0.857$ vs.\\ $0.786$), producing the first joint diagnostic of per-model contamination susceptibility and per-judge severity.",

Looking at page 8: The conclusion section ends with "...producing the first joint diagnostic of per-model contamination susceptibility"

Page 9 starts with: "and per-judge severity."

So just ONE line spills to page 9! I need to save just 1 more line. Let me trim one more phrase from the conclusion.

Current text:
"We introduced the Gated Many-Facet Rasch Model (G-MFRM), which jointly estimates model ability, judge severity, and contamination susceptibility by formalizing their confounding as an omitted variable bias problem and resolving it through three-stage estimation with externally fixed exposure, for which we established formal identifiability guarantees and error propagation bounds. 

On Arena-Hard with eight models and six judges, G-MFRM is the only method to change the baseline ranking ($\tau = 0.857$ vs.\ $0.786$), producing the first joint diagnostic of contamination susceptibility and judge severity."

Option 3 works—removing "for which we established" and just stating the guarantees directly saves enough space to keep everything on page 8. I'm trying to trim just enough words to fit the conclusion on one line—the overflow is minimal. Shortening "contamination susceptibility" to just "contamination" saves a word, and I could replace "for which we established" with something leaner like "backed by" to cut a couple more. The key is keeping the meaning intact while being more concise.

<details><summary>Logged reasoning block</summary>

```text
Consistency check passed with 0 critical issues. Just 3 orphan bib entries (piironen2017horseshoe, sanmartin2016, uto2020generalized) — these are cited in the appendix which the checker might not have scanned, or they were removed from the main text during previous compressions. Let me check if sanmartin2016 is cited in the appendix.

From the appendix I read earlier, line 57: "...whose identifiability is established by \citet[Chapter~5]{sanmartin2016}..."


So sanmartin2016 is definitely cited in the appendix, and the checker likely only scanned the main text. The same probably applies to piironen2017horseshoe. These are just warnings anyway, not critical issues, so I can move forward. Now I need to summarize the framing adjustment changes and page fix for the Director report.

    "content": "- update-config: Use this skill to configure the Claude Code harness via settings.json. Automated behaviors (\"from now on when X\", \"each time X\", \"whenever X\", \"before/after X\") require hooks configured in settings.json - the harness executes these, not Claude, so memory/preferences cannot fulfill them. Also use for: permissions (\"allow X\", \"add permission\", \"move permission to\"), env vars (\"set X=Y\"), hook troubleshooting, or any changes to settings.json/settings.local.json files. Examples: \"allow npm commands\", \"add bq permission to global settings\", \"move permission to user settings\", \"set DEBUG=true\", \"when claude stops show X\". For simple settings like theme/model, suggest the /config command.\n- keybindings-help: Use when the user wants to customize keyboard shortcuts, rebind keys, add chord bindings, or modify ~/.claude/keybindings.json. Examples: \"rebind ctrl+s\", \"add a chord shortcut\", \"change the submit key\", \"customize keybindings\".\n- simplify: Review changed code for reuse, quality, and efficiency, then fix any issues found.\n- fewer-permission-prompts: Scan your transcripts for common read-only Bash and MCP tool calls, then add a prioritized allowlist to project .claude/settings.json to reduce permission prompts.\n- loop: Run a prompt or slash command on a recurring interval (e.g. /loop 5m /foo). Omit the interval to let the model self-pace. - When the user wants to set up a recurring task, poll for status, or run something repeatedly on an interval (e.g. \"check the deploy every 5 minutes\", \"keep running /babysit-prs\"). Do NOT invoke for one-off tasks.\n- schedule: Create, update, list, or run scheduled remote agents (routines) that execute on a cron schedule. - When the user wants to schedule a recurring remote agent, set up automated tasks, create a cron job for Claude Code, or manage their scheduled agents/routines. Also use when the user wants a one-time scheduled run (\"run this once at 3pm\", \"remind me to check X tomorrow\").\n- claude-api: Build, debug, and optimize Claude API / Anthropic SDK apps. Apps built with this skill should include prompt caching. Also handles migrating existing Claude API code between Claude model versions (4.5 → 4.6, 4.6 → 4.7, retired-model replacements).\nTRIGGER when: code imports `anthropic`/`@anthropic-ai/sdk`; user asks for the Claude API, Anthropic SDK, or Managed Agents; user adds/modifies/tunes a Claude feature (caching, thinking, compaction, tool use, batch, files, citations, memory) or model (Opus/Sonnet/Haiku) in a file; questions about prompt caching / cache hit rate in an Anthropic SDK project.\nSKIP: file imports `openai`/other-provider SDK, filename like `*-openai.py`/`*-generic.py`, provider-neutral code, general programming/ML.\n- init: Initialize a new CLAUDE.md file with codebase documentation\n- review: Review a pull request\n- security-review: Complete a security review of the pending changes on the current branch",

exp-009 Part B 50 seeds 最终结果：CI coverage = **71.0%**（之前论文写的是 ~73%，需要修正）。

limitations.tex 中将 "approximately 73%" 改为 "71\% (50 Monte Carlo seeds)"。其他措辞不变。

同时确认 c_n correlation = 0.747, c_n RMSE = 0.648——如果论文中引用了这些数字也一并更新。

Director wants me to:
1. Update CI coverage in limitations.tex from ~73% to 71% (50 Monte Carlo seeds)
2. Check if c_n correlation = 0.747 and c_n RMSE = 0.648 are referenced in the paper and update them if so

Let me first update limitations.tex, then search for any references to c_n correlation and c_n RMSE values.
```

1	We identify three limitations. First, the fully crossed design requirement (Theorem~\ref{thm:sufficient}, condition~i) demands that every judge scores every model on every item, limiting scalability to settings with many judges or models; extending G-MFRM to incomplete designs via structured missing data models is a direction for future work; relatedly, sparse observations per item in the current design produce elevated item-level mean-square residuals (92/176 items), though model- and judge-level fit remains acceptable. Second, Stage~2 exposure estimation relies on a reference model anchor (gpt-4-0314), and exposure estimate quality depends on the anchor remaining uncontaminated relative to the benchmark; as benchmarks age, anchor validity should be periodically re-assessed. Third, the current evaluation uses a single benchmark (Arena-Hard) with eight target models; generalization to other benchmarks (e.g., MT-Bench, WildBench) and larger model populations remains to be verified. Fourth, empirical CI coverage is approximately 73\%, below the 95\% nominal level, indicating moderate posterior overconfidence likely due to the HalfNormal prior's boundary constraint and NUTS tree depth saturation. Point estimates and rank orderings ($\tau = 0.857$) are unaffected, but reported CIs should be interpreted as lower bounds on true uncertainty; exploring more flexible priors or post-hoc calibration is a direction for future work.

Third, the current evaluation uses a single benchmark (Arena-Hard) with eight target models; generalization to other benchmarks (e.g., MT-Bench, WildBench) and larger model populations remains to be verified. Fourth, empirical CI coverage is approximately 73\\%, below the 95\\% nominal level, indicating moderate posterior overconfidence likely due to the HalfNormal prior's boundary constraint and NUTS tree depth saturation. Point estimates and rank orderings ($\\tau = 0.857$) are unaffected, but reported CIs should be interpreted as lower bounds on true uncertainty; exploring more flexible priors or post-hoc calibration is a direction for future work.\n",

```text
The grep results show that `0.747` and `0.648` don't appear in the paper, and c_n RMSE values in the paper are synthetic experiment values (0.544, 0.739, 1.341 from ablation; 0.533, 0.545, 0.575, 0.842 from error propagation), not the specific values Director mentioned. The c_n correlation = 0.747 and c_n RMSE = 0.648 are likely from a different experiment (exp-009 Part B) and don't appear to be referenced in the current paper text.


So I just need to update the limitations.tex file to change "approximately 73%" to "71% (50 Monte Carlo seeds)".

[Director 指令] [Patch — 紧急] Bootstrap Δτ 结果确认 Claim 3 ranking improvement 不显著，需要修改论文

**Bootstrap 结果**：
- Δτ 95% CI = [−0.071, 0.071]，包含 0
- P(Δτ > 0) = 0.451
- τ_GMFRM mean = 0.813（点估计 0.857 在 CI 上界）

**需要修改的地方：**

1. **abstract.tex**：删除/弱化 ranking improvement 的 headline claim。改为强调诊断贡献："G-MFRM identifies statistically significant per-model contamination susceptibility (top-4 models' 95% CIs exclude zero) and produces interpretable judge severity profiles, while yielding a nominally higher point-estimate ranking agreement (τ = 0.857 vs. 0.786)"

2. **experiments.tex** — τ 改进段落：
   - 诚实报告 bootstrap 结果："Bootstrap resampling from 4,000 posterior draws yields Δτ 95% CI [−0.071, 0.071], indicating that the point-estimate improvement is not statistically significant at the 8-model resolution (minimum detectable Δτ ≈ 0.036)"
   - 紧跟补充合成数据证据："On synthetic data with N=50 models, joint estimation significantly outperforms sequential (τ = 0.922 vs. 0.826, p = 0.002 by Wilcoxon test across 20 seeds), confirming that the improvement is real but requires larger N to detect on real data"
   - P(θ_mini > θ_qwen) = 0.853 也报告："85% of posterior draws maintain the gpt-4o-mini ≻ qwen2.5-72b ordering"

3. **introduction.tex** Contribution 4：确保不 overclaim ranking。保持 D021 的 framing："produces the first joint diagnostic..." 为主，ranking 为辅

4. **conclusion.tex**：与 abstract 对齐，diagnostic-first framing

**关键叙事策略**：
- Real data (N=8): diagnostic value 是核心贡献（c_n profiles, d_j profiles, contamination detection）
- Synthetic data (N=50): ranking improvement 统计显著
- Real data ranking: "consistent with but not conclusive due to small N"
- 这是诚实且站得住的 framing

This is a significant patch - the bootstrap results show the τ improvement is not statistically significant, so we need to honestly report this while maintaining the diagnostic contribution as the core claim. Let me work through the 4 files systematically.

Let me first read the current state of all files that need modification.

On Arena-Hard with eight models and six judges, G-MFRM is the only method to change the baseline ranking ($\tau = 0.857$ vs.\ $0.786$), producing the first joint contamination-susceptibility and judge-severity diagnostic.

1	\begin{abstract}
2	LLM-as-a-judge evaluation corrects for judge bias and benchmark contamination independently, but sequential correction produces biased model ability estimates. We formalize this failure as an omitted variable bias (OVB) problem: when judge severity and contamination effects are both present, any estimator that models one while omitting the other yields asymptotically biased ability estimates---even when the two facets are uncorrelated. We propose the Gated Many-Facet Rasch Model (G-MFRM), which jointly calibrates model ability, item difficulty, judge severity, and contamination susceptibility through staged estimation with externally anchored per-item exposure indicators. Formal identifiability analysis proves that fixing exposure externally is both necessary and sufficient for parameter separation under standard multi-judge designs. Error propagation analysis establishes a critical noise threshold $\sigma_{\mathrm{crit}} = \sqrt{\mathrm{Var}(e_i)}$ below which ability estimates degrade by less than 6\%. In synthetic experiments ($N = 50$, $I = 100$, $J = 8$), G-MFRM reduces ability RMSE by 43.8\% relative to sequential estimation ($p < 10^{-6}$). On Arena-Hard with 8 target models and 6 judges, G-MFRM is the only method that changes the baseline ranking, and produces the first joint diagnostic of per-model contamination susceptibility and per-judge severity from a single evaluation run.

In synthetic experiments ($N = 50$, $I = 100$, $J = 8$), G-MFRM reduces ability RMSE by 43.8\\% relative to sequential estimation ($p < 10^{-6}$). On Arena-Hard with 8 target models and 6 judges, G-MFRM is the only method that changes the baseline ranking, and produces the first joint diagnostic of per-model contamination susceptibility and per-judge severity from a single evaluation run.\n\\end{abstract}",

1	\section{Experiments}
2	\label{sec:experiments}
3	
4	\subsection{Setup}
5	\label{sec:setup}
6	
7	\paragraph{Data and models.} We evaluate on Arena-Hard \citep{li2024arenahard}, a benchmark of 316 multi-turn conversational items selected for high separability among frontier models. After filtering for full coverage across all judges and target models, the evaluation set contains 176 items in a fully crossed design. Eight target models spanning proprietary and open-source families are evaluated (Table~\ref{tab:main_results}). Ground-truth rankings are derived from Chatbot Arena human preference data \citep{zheng2023mtbench}.
8	
9	\paragraph{Judges.} Six LLM judge families score all model responses in position-swapped pairwise mode: GPT-5.5, Claude Opus 4.7, Claude Sonnet 4.6, DeepSeek-V4-Pro, Qwen3-235B, and Llama 4 Maverick. Position swapping controls for position bias and doubles the effective observation count.
10	
11	\paragraph{Exposure estimation.} Per-item exposure $e_i$ is estimated via a two-source pipeline (\S\ref{sec:staged}): reference model anchoring with gpt-4-0314 as anchor (75\% weight) and cross-model agreement (25\% weight). The pipeline is robust to weight configuration (Spearman $\rho \geq 0.998$ across all configurations tested).
12	
13	\paragraph{MCMC.} We use NumPyro NUTS with 4{,}000 warmup and 4{,}000 sampling iterations across 4 chains (target acceptance 0.95). The contamination prior follows the hierarchical HalfNormal specification (Eq.~\ref{eq:contam_prior}). Convergence is assessed via rank-normalized split-$\hat{R}$ and bulk/tail ESS \citep{vehtari2021rhat}.
14	
15	\subsection{Baselines and Main Results}
16	\label{sec:main_results}
17	
18	We compare G-MFRM against seven methods that address judge bias or contamination separately: (1) Raw Average, (2) MFRM-only (Eq.~\ref{eq:mfrm}), (3) Sequential pipeline (MFRM then contamination adjustment), (4) CyclicJudge \citep{cyclicjudge2026}, (5) CyclicJudge+discard (exposed items removed), (6) DCR Factor \citep{dcr2025}, and (7) Preference Leakage calibration \citep{preference_leakage2026}. All methods are evaluated by Kendall $\tau$ and Spearman $\rho$ against Chatbot Arena human rankings.
19

23	\begin{tabular}{lcc}

38	\caption{Correlation with Chatbot Arena human rankings on Arena-Hard (8 target models, 6 judges). All seven baselines produce identical rankings ($\tau = 0.786$). G-MFRM is the only method that improves rank agreement ($+$7.1pp).}
39	\label{tab:main_results}
40	\end{table}
41	
42	All seven baselines produce identical model rankings ($\tau = 0.786$, $\rho = 0.905$). This reflects the structural confounding from Section~\ref{sec:confounding}: single-facet corrections leave the uncorrected confound intact, producing invariant rank orderings (Observation~\ref{obs:ovb}). G-MFRM achieves nominally higher rank agreement ($\tau = 0.857$, $\rho = 0.952$, $+$0.071 over the baseline $\tau = 0.786$), the only method to change the baseline ranking. With $N = 8$ target models, this improvement corresponds to a single corrected pairwise ranking ($2/\binom{8}{2} \approx 0.071$ per swap); the real-data result serves as illustrative evidence alongside the statistically significant synthetic validation ($N = 50$, Section~\ref{sec:error_prop_results}). The rank change is concentrated in the mid-range: gpt-4o-mini and qwen2.5-72b swap positions (ranks 2 and 3), consistent with differential contamination susceptibility. The $\theta$ credible intervals for the swapped pair overlap, indicating that the rank reversal lies within posterior uncertainty.
43	
44	The MCMC sampler achieves rank-normalized split-$\hat{R} \leq 1.03$ across all parameters with zero divergent transitions and minimum bulk ESS of 217.\footnote{$\hat{R} = 1.03$ satisfies the traditional 1.05 threshold but exceeds the stricter 1.01 of \citet{vehtari2021rhat}. Rank correlations are stable across chain subsets, suggesting adequate mixing for the ranking task.} Model and judge facets show acceptable fit (all infit/outfit MNSQ within $[0.63, 1.07]$; item-level diagnostics in Appendix). Posterior predictive checks confirm adequate model fit (predicted response rate $0.593$ vs.\ observed $0.599$; Appendix~\ref{app:ppc}). Contamination susceptibility $\hat{c}_n$ exhibits a significant gradient by model age. Four models have 95\% CIs entirely above 1.0: GPT-3.5-Turbo ($5.60$ [4.40, 6.80]), GPT-4-0613 ($4.20$ [3.10, 5.30]), Qwen2.5-72B ($3.00$ [1.40, 4.60]), and LLaMA-3.3-70B ($2.50$ [1.10, 3.90]). Mid-range values appear for Gemma-2-9B ($1.70$) and Qwen3-8B ($1.20$). The most recent models show weak contamination with CIs near zero: GPT-4o ($0.88$ [0.05, 2.20]) and GPT-4o-mini ($0.93$ [0.06, 2.20]). The top-two and bottom-two CIs do not overlap, and the global shrinkage scale $\hat{\sigma}_c = 2.40$ [1.70, 3.40] confirms substantial inter-model heterogeneity. The mean $\bar{c} = 2.50$ aligns with the strong-contamination regime in our synthetic validation, confirming that benchmark contamination in Arena-Hard is non-negligible. Notably, sequential estimation yields near-zero contamination estimates ($\bar{c} \approx 0$), demonstrating that without joint modeling, contamination effects are entirely absorbed into ability estimates $\hat{\theta}$---precisely the omitted variable bias predicted by the theoretical analysis (Section~\ref{sec:confounding}). Judge severity $d_j$ separates by provenance: proprietary judges score more strictly (Claude Opus $+0.60$, GPT-5.5 $+0.53$, DeepSeek $+0.31$) than open-source judges (Mistral $-0.74$, LLaMA $-0.42$, Qwen2.5-72B $-0.35$). Results are robust to prior specification: Horseshoe and HalfNormal hierarchical priors yield near-identical point estimates (Pearson $r > 0.999$) despite markedly different convergence properties (Appendix).
45	
46	\subsection{Error Propagation Robustness}
47	\label{sec:error_prop_results}
48	
49	Section~\ref{sec:error_prop} predicted that ability estimates degrade gracefully when exposure noise $\sigma$ remains below $\sqrt{\mathrm{Var}(e_i)} \approx 0.2$. We validate this prediction by injecting Gaussian noise into the true exposure values and re-fitting G-MFRM on synthetic data ($N = 50$, $I = 100$, $J = 8$, 20 seeds; exp-012).
50	
51	\begin{table}[t]
52	\centering
53	\small
54	\begin{tabular}{lcccc}
55	\toprule
56	$\sigma$ & $\theta$-RMSE & $\Delta\theta$\% & $c_n$-RMSE & $\Delta c_n$\% \\
57	\midrule
58	0.0 & 0.128 $\pm$ 0.018 & --- & 0.533 $\pm$ 0.187 & --- \\
59	0.1 & 0.130 $\pm$ 0.018 & +1.4 & 0.545 $\pm$ 0.192 & +2.3 \\
60	0.2 & 0.135 $\pm$ 0.018 & +5.9 & 0.575 $\pm$ 0.198 & +7.9 \\
61	0.5 & 0.175 $\pm$ 0.027 & +36.9 & 0.842 $\pm$ 0.281 & +57.9 \\
62	\bottomrule
63	\end{tabular}
64	\caption{Error propagation robustness (exp-012). Ability RMSE degrades by less than 6\% when exposure noise $\sigma \leq 0.2$, matching the theoretical prediction. Contamination estimates are more sensitive due to multiplicative coupling with $e_i$.}
65	\label{tab:error_prop}
66	\end{table}
67	
68	Table~\ref{tab:error_prop} confirms the theoretical prediction. Below the threshold ($\sigma \leq 0.2$), ability RMSE increases by 5.9\% and contamination RMSE by 7.9\%; at $\sigma = 0.1$, degradation is negligible (1.4\% and 2.3\%). Beyond the threshold ($\sigma = 0.5$), degradation becomes substantial ($+$36.9\% and $+$57.9\% respectively). Contamination estimates are more sensitive because $c_n$ enters the likelihood only through its product with $e_i$, while $\theta_n$ contributes additively. Rank ordering is preserved even at $\sigma = 0.5$ ($\tau > 0.88$), validating that practical exposure methods need only achieve moderate accuracy to produce reliable corrections.
69	
70	Table~\ref{tab:ablation} (Appendix) reports ablation results on synthetic data ($N = 50$, $I = 100$, $J = 8$). The dominant effect is joint versus staged estimation: staged estimation degrades $\theta$-RMSE by $2.2\times$ ($\tau$ drops 9.6pp), directly validating the OVB analysis; continuous gating improves $c_n$-RMSE by 36\% over binary gating, confirming that modeling contamination magnitude has practical value. Under the balanced $J = 8$ design, removing judge severity $d_j$ has minimal impact ($\theta$-RMSE $+$1.6\%); we retain it for theoretical completeness and its independent diagnostic value.

1	\section{Introduction}
2	\label{sec:introduction}
3	
4	Large Language Model (LLM) evaluation increasingly relies on LLM-as-a-judge protocols, where one or more LLM judges score model responses on structured benchmarks \citep{zheng2023mtbench}. Two well-documented sources of distortion affect these evaluations: \emph{judge bias}, where different judges assign systematically different scores to the same response, and \emph{benchmark contamination}, where models achieve inflated scores on items encountered during training. Both problems have received sustained research attention, producing separate toolkits for bias calibration and contamination detection. These toolkits treat the two distortions as independent phenomena, a separation that reflects their origins in different research communities rather than any principled argument for independence. Accurate ability ranking is essential for model selection, safety evaluation, and benchmark design; systematic distortion in estimated abilities undermines all three. Yet a practitioner who needs both corrections must apply them sequentially: first correct one source of distortion, then the other. This sequential approach produces unreliable ability estimates. In synthetic experiments with 50 models, 100 items, and 8 judges, sequential estimation yields ability root mean squared error (RMSE) of $0.221 \pm 0.038$, while joint estimation achieves $0.124 \pm 0.016$, a 43.8\% reduction (Wilcoxon $p < 10^{-6}$). The gap does not arise from estimation noise or algorithmic limitations of individual methods; it reflects structural confounding between judge bias and contamination that no sequential pipeline can resolve.
5	
6	Existing methods address these distortions in isolation. Judge bias corrections---CyclicJudge \citep{cyclicjudge2026}, UDA \citep{uda2026}---remove systematic inter-judge differences without modeling contamination. Contamination detection tools---ConStat \citep{constat2024}, DCR \citep{dcr2025}, LogProber \citep{logprober2024}---adjust for memorization without accounting for judge effects (see Section~\ref{sec:related_work} for detailed review). A bias-first pipeline absorbs contamination-induced score inflation into ability estimates, because the bias model attributes all residual systematic variation to genuine ability. A contamination-first pipeline misattributes judge severity differences as contamination, because score elevation from a lenient judge is indistinguishable from elevation due to memorization without a joint model. In either ordering, the first correction stage produces estimates distorted by the unmodeled facet, and the second stage inherits this distortion.
7	
8	We formalize this confounding as an omitted variable bias (OVB) problem \citep{angrist2009mostly}. Within the Many-Facet Rasch Model (MFRM) framework \citep{linacre1989mfrm}, the complete data-generating process includes both judge severity $d_j$ and a contamination interaction $c_n \cdot e_i$. Fitting a specification that omits the contamination term produces biased parameter estimates: the omission of $c_n \cdot e_i$ induces a specification bias that persists regardless of confounding structure, with an additional directional component when judge severity and contamination are non-orthogonal. The OVB framework predicts that the bias magnitude scales with the contamination susceptibility $c_n$ of each model, so the most contaminated models receive the largest upward distortion in estimated ability. For practical benchmark evaluations, this means that the more a model's training data overlaps with the benchmark, the more its ability is overestimated, precisely the failure mode that contamination correction is designed to prevent. Synthetic validation confirms the predicted pattern: the Pearson correlation between sequential estimation bias and true $c_n$ reaches $r = 0.86$ ($p < 0.001$), which shows that contaminated models are systematically overestimated under both sequential orderings (Section~\ref{sec:confounding}).
9	
10	We propose the Gated Many-Facet Rasch Model (G-MFRM), which combines the multi-facet structure of MFRM \citep{linacre1989mfrm, jiao2025mfrm_llm} with the gating mechanism of Doubly-Gated Item Response Theory (DG-IRT) \citep{shu2013dgirt} to jointly estimate model ability, judge severity, and contamination susceptibility in a single measurement framework. G-MFRM extends the MFRM linear predictor with a multiplicative contamination gating term $c_n \cdot e_i$, where $c_n \geq 0$ captures model-specific contamination susceptibility and $e_i \in [0,1]$ quantifies per-item exposure. When $c_n = 0$ or $e_i = 0$, the gating term vanishes and the model reduces to standard MFRM, so uncontaminated model-item pairs incur no distortion. Because the bilinear product $c_n \cdot e_i$ cannot be uniquely decomposed from response data alone, G-MFRM employs a three-stage calibration procedure: (1) standard MFRM warm-start to obtain initial parameter estimates, (2) external per-item exposure estimation from evidence independent of the response data, and (3) joint Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling with $e_i$ fixed from Stage~2. We provide a formal identifiability analysis (Propositions~\ref{prop:no_new}--\ref{prop:exposure_variation} and Theorem~\ref{thm:sufficient}) that proves fixing $e_i$ externally is both necessary and sufficient for parameter separation under standard multi-judge designs (Section~\ref{sec:method}). A complementary error propagation analysis bounds the impact of Stage~2 measurement noise: when exposure estimation error satisfies $\sigma \leq 0.2$, ability RMSE degradation remains below 6\%. Figure~\ref{fig:framework} provides an overview of the complete framework.
11	
12	Our contributions are as follows:
13	\begin{enumerate}
14	    \item We identify and formalize, under a linear approximation to the logit link, the confounding between judge bias and benchmark contamination in LLM evaluation as an omitted variable bias problem, and show that sequential correction produces directional bias proportional to model contamination levels (Section~\ref{sec:confounding}, Figure~\ref{fig:ovb_bias}).
15	    \item We propose the G-MFRM framework with formal identifiability guarantees (Propositions~\ref{prop:no_new}--\ref{prop:exposure_variation} and Theorem~\ref{thm:sufficient}) and quantified error propagation bounds for the staged estimation procedure (Section~\ref{sec:method}, Table~\ref{tab:error_prop}).
16	    \item Synthetic validation confirms that joint estimation reduces ability RMSE by 43.8\% relative to sequential estimation ($p < 10^{-6}$), with Kendall rank correlation $\tau = 0.922$ versus $\tau = 0.859$ (Section~\ref{sec:experiments}).
17	    \item On Arena-Hard with 6 LLM judges and 8 target models, G-MFRM produces the first joint diagnostic of per-model contamination susceptibility and per-judge severity, with nominally improved rank agreement ($\tau = 0.857$ vs.\ $0.786$ for all seven baselines; Section~\ref{sec:experiments}).

Now I need to make the 4 changes. Let me plan each one:

1. **abstract.tex**: The last sentence needs to shift from "changes the baseline ranking" to diagnostic-first with ranking as nominal. Director's suggestion: "G-MFRM identifies statistically significant per-model contamination susceptibility (top-4 models' 95% CIs exclude zero) and produces interpretable judge severity profiles, while yielding a nominally higher point-estimate ranking agreement (τ = 0.857 vs. 0.786)"

2. **experiments.tex**: The τ paragraph (line 42) needs the bootstrap results added. 

For the experiments section, I need to incorporate the bootstrap confidence interval for the τ difference, the probability that the difference is positive, and the probability that the Qwen model outperforms the mini model, along with a cross-reference to the synthetic data results.

3. **introduction.tex**: Contribution 4 (line 17) already says "produces the first joint diagnostic...with nominally improved rank agreement" — this is already diagnostic-first. Just need to make sure it doesn't overclaim.

4. **conclusion.tex**: Align with abstract — diagnostic-first.

I should also check the table caption in experiments.tex line 38 to see if it needs adjusting.

Now I'm going through the abstract to revise the final sentence. The Director wants me to shift from claiming G-MFRM is the only method that changes rankings to emphasizing the statistical significance of the contamination susceptibility findings and the interpretable judge severity profiles, while noting the nominally improved rank agreement. I need to be careful about the page count since we're exactly at 8 pages, so I'll need to watch for any expansion. The improvement is modest and within uncertainty—the bootstrap confidence interval spans zero, and there's only a 45% posterior probability the true difference is positive. The rank swap between gpt-4o-mini and qwen2.5-72b reflects differential contamination susceptibility, though their credible intervals overlap, placing the reversal within posterior uncertainty. The synthetic validation with larger sample size ($N = 50$) shows clearer separation ($\tau = 0.922$ vs 0.826), providing stronger evidence for the method's effectiveness.

For the table caption, I should soften the claim to acknowledge the bootstrap CI includes zero. And for the introduction, "nominally" already hedges the ranking improvement claim appropriately, so I'll keep that phrasing consistent throughout.

The conclusion needs careful handling since space is already tight on page 8—I can't add much without overflow. I'll reorder to lead with the diagnostic contribution and mention the rank agreement as a secondary finding with the caveat that it's not statistically significant at N=8.

For the abstract, I'm trying to tighten the language while keeping the key claims. The Director wants emphasis on the diagnostic itself rather than just that it changes rankings. Let me draft a version that leads with the diagnostic and adds the rank agreement detail more concisely.

For the experiments section, I need to compress the τ paragraph significantly. The core message is that G-MFRM has a nominally higher rank agreement than baselines, but the improvement isn't statistically significant given the sample size. I should state the point estimates, mention the bootstrap CI, and conclude that it's not significant—all in tighter prose without repeating what's already in the abstract.

Let me rewrite this more concisely: G-MFRM achieves nominally higher rank agreement ($\tau = 0.857$ vs. $0.786$), but bootstrap resampling yields a 95% CI for the difference that includes zero, indicating the improvement isn't statistically significant at $N = 8$. Synthetic experiments with $N = 50$ models show the method does provide real gains when sample size is larger, with the ranking change primarily affecting mid-tier models like gpt-4o-mini and qwen2.5-72b. I'm worried about page length here—adding this denser analysis could push us over. Let me see if I can compress the statistical findings further while keeping the key results: the effect shows up on synthetic data with strong significance, but at the real sample size it's below detection threshold, with the main rank shift being between two mid-tier models. Looking at the character counts and what's being replaced—I'm cutting several sentences about the swap probability and credible interval overlaps, so the net addition is probably just one or two lines. The new content fits within the existing space without needing major restructuring. Bootstrap resampling across 4,000 posterior draws shows the improvement isn't statistically significant at this sample size (95% CI spans zero, $P(\Delta\tau > 0) = 0.451$), but synthetic data with $N = 50$ reveals the effect is genuine—joint estimation substantially outperforms sequential estimation with high statistical confidence. The rank swap between gpt-4o-mini and qwen2.5-72b aligns with their differential contamination susceptibility, supported by posterior probability that mini exceeds qwen at 0.853.

For the table caption, I'm clarifying that G-MFRM shows nominally higher rank agreement in point estimates, though the bootstrap confidence interval for the improvement includes zero, indicating uncertainty about the true effect.

After filtering for full coverage across all judges and target models, the evaluation set contains 176 items in a fully crossed design. Eight target models spanning proprietary and open-source families are evaluated (Table~\\ref{tab:main_results}). Ground-truth rankings are derived from Chatbot Arena human preference data \\citep{zheng2023mtbench}.\n\n\\paragraph{Judges.} Six LLM judge families score all model responses in position-swapped pairwise mode: GPT-5.5, Claude Opus 4.7, Claude Sonnet 4.6, DeepSeek-V4-Pro, Qwen3-235B, and Llama 4 Maverick. Position swapping controls for position bias and doubles the effective observation count.\n\n\\paragraph{Exposure estimation.} Per-item exposure $e_i$ is estimated via a two-source pipeline (\\S\\ref{sec:staged}): reference model anchoring with gpt-4-0314 as anchor (75\\% weight) and cross-model agreement (25\\% weight). The pipeline is robust to weight configuration (Spearman $\\rho \\geq 0.998$ across all configurations tested).\n\n\\paragraph{MCMC.} We use NumPyro NUTS with 4{,}000 warmup and 4{,}000 sampling iterations across 4 chains (target acceptance 0.95). The contamination prior follows the hierarchical HalfNormal specification (Eq.~\\ref{eq:contam_prior}). Convergence is assessed via rank-normalized split-$\\hat{R}$ and bulk/tail ESS \\citep{vehtari2021rhat}.\n\n\\subsection{Baselines and Main Results}\n\\label{sec:main_results}\n\nWe compare G-MFRM against seven methods that address judge bias or contamination separately: (1) Raw Average, (2) MFRM-only (Eq.~\\ref{eq:mfrm}), (3) Sequential pipeline (MFRM then contamination adjustment), (4) CyclicJudge \\citep{cyclicjudge2026}, (5) CyclicJudge+discard (exposed items removed), (6) DCR Factor \\citep{dcr2025}, and (7) Preference Leakage calibration \\citep{preference_leakage2026}. All methods are evaluated by Kendall $\\tau$ and Spearman $\\rho$ against Chatbot Arena human rankings.\n\n\\begin{table}[t]\n\\centering\n\\small\n\\begin{tabular}{lcc}\n\\toprule\n\\textbf{Method} & $\\tau$ & $\\rho$ \\\\\n\\midrule\nRaw Average & 0.786 & 0.905 \\\\\nMFRM-only & 0.786 & 0.905 \\\\\nSequential & 0.786 & 0.905 \\\\\nCyclicJudge & 0.786 & 0.905 \\\\\nCyclicJudge+discard & 0.786 & 0.905 \\\\\nDCR Factor & 0.786 & 0.905 \\\\\nPref.\\ Leakage & 0.786 & 0.905 \\\\\n\\midrule\nG-MFRM (ours) & \\textbf{0.857} & \\textbf{0.952} \\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}\n\\caption{Correlation with Chatbot Arena human rankings on Arena-Hard (8 target models, 6 judges).

This reflects the structural confounding from Section~\\ref{sec:confounding}: single-facet corrections leave the uncorrected confound intact, producing invariant rank orderings (Observation~\\ref{obs:ovb}). G-MFRM achieves nominally higher rank agreement ($\\tau = 0.857$, $\\rho = 0.952$, $+$0.071 over the baseline $\\tau = 0.786$), the only method to change the baseline ranking. With $N = 8$ target models, this improvement corresponds to a single corrected pairwise ranking ($2/\\binom{8}{2} \\approx 0.071$ per swap); the real-data result serves as illustrative evidence alongside the statistically significant synthetic validation ($N = 50$, Section~\\ref{sec:error_prop_results}). The rank change is concentrated in the mid-range: gpt-4o-mini and qwen2.5-72b swap positions (ranks 2 and 3), consistent with differential contamination susceptibility. The $\\theta$ credible intervals for the swapped pair overlap, indicating that the rank reversal lies within posterior uncertainty.\n\nThe MCMC sampler achieves rank-normalized split-$\\hat{R} \\leq 1.03$ across all parameters with zero divergent transitions and minimum bulk ESS of 217.\\footnote{$\\hat{R} = 1.03$ satisfies the traditional 1.05 threshold but exceeds the stricter 1.01 of \\citet{vehtari2021rhat}.

Posterior predictive checks confirm adequate model fit (predicted response rate $0.593$ vs.\\ observed $0.599$; Appendix~\\ref{app:ppc}). Contamination susceptibility $\\hat{c}_n$ exhibits a significant gradient by model age. Four models have 95\\% CIs entirely above 1.0: GPT-3.5-Turbo ($5.60$ [4.40, 6.80]), GPT-4-0613 ($4.20$ [3.10, 5.30]), Qwen2.5-72B ($3.00$ [1.40, 4.60]), and LLaMA-3.3-70B ($2.50$ [1.10, 3.90]). Mid-range values appear for Gemma-2-9B ($1.70$) and Qwen3-8B ($1.20$). The most recent models show weak contamination with CIs near zero: GPT-4o ($0.88$ [0.05, 2.20]) and GPT-4o-mini ($0.93$ [0.06, 2.20]). The top-two and bottom-two CIs do not overlap, and the global shrinkage scale $\\hat{\\sigma}_c = 2.40$ [1.70, 3.40] confirms substantial inter-model heterogeneity. The mean $\\bar{c} = 2.50$ aligns with the strong-contamination regime in our synthetic validation, confirming that benchmark contamination in Arena-Hard is non-negligible. Notably, sequential estimation yields near-zero contamination estimates ($\\bar{c} \\approx 0$), demonstrating that without joint modeling, contamination effects are entirely absorbed into ability estimates $\\hat{\\theta}$---precisely the omitted variable bias predicted by the theoretical analysis (Section~\\ref{sec:confounding}). Judge severity $d_j$ separates by provenance: proprietary judges score more strictly (Claude Opus $+0.60$, GPT-5.5 $+0.53$, DeepSeek $+0.31$) than open-source judges (Mistral $-0.74$, LLaMA $-0.42$, Qwen2.5-72B $-0.35$). Results are robust to prior specification: Horseshoe and HalfNormal hierarchical priors yield near-identical point estimates (Pearson $r > 0.999$) despite markedly different convergence properties (Appendix).\n\n\\subsection{Error Propagation Robustness}\n\\label{sec:error_prop_results}\n\nSection~\\ref{sec:error_prop} predicted that ability estimates degrade gracefully when exposure noise $\\sigma$ remains below $\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Var}(e_i)} \\approx 0.2$. We validate this prediction by injecting Gaussian noise into the true exposure values and re-fitting G-MFRM on synthetic data ($N = 50$, $I = 100$, $J = 8$, 20 seeds; exp-012).\n\n\\begin{table}[t]\n\\centering\n\\small\n\\begin{tabular}{lcccc}\n\\toprule\n$\\sigma$ & $\\theta$-RMSE & $\\Delta\\theta$\\% & $c_n$-RMSE & $\\Delta c_n$\\% \\\\\n\\midrule\n0.0 & 0.128 $\\pm$ 0.018 & --- & 0.533 $\\pm$ 0.187 & --- \\\\\n0.1 & 0.130 $\\pm$ 0.018 & +1.4 & 0.545 $\\pm$ 0.192 & +2.3 \\\\\n0.2 & 0.135 $\\pm$ 0.018 & +5.9 & 0.575 $\\pm$ 0.198 & +7.9 \\\\\n0.5 & 0.175 $\\pm$ 0.027 & +36.9 & 0.842 $\\pm$ 0.281 & +57.9 \\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}\n\\caption{Error propagation robustness (exp-012). Ability RMSE degrades by less than 6\\% when exposure noise $\\sigma \\leq 0.2$, matching the theoretical prediction. Contamination estimates are more sensitive due to multiplicative coupling with $e_i$.}\n\\label{tab:error_prop}\n\\end{table}\n\nTable~\\ref{tab:error_prop} confirms the theoretical prediction. Below the threshold ($\\sigma \\leq 0.2$), ability RMSE increases by 5.9\\% and contamination RMSE by 7.9\\%; at $\\sigma = 0.1$, degradation is negligible (1.4\\% and 2.3\\%). Beyond the threshold ($\\sigma = 0.5$), degradation becomes substantial ($+$36.9\\% and $+$57.9\\% respectively). Contamination estimates are more sensitive because $c_n$ enters the likelihood only through its product with $e_i$, while $\\theta_n$ contributes additively. Rank ordering is preserved even at $\\sigma = 0.5$ ($\\tau > 0.88$), validating that practical exposure methods need only achieve moderate accuracy to produce reliable corrections.\n\nTable~\\ref{tab:ablation} (Appendix) reports ablation results on synthetic data ($N = 50$, $I = 100$, $J = 8$). The dominant effect is joint versus staged estimation: staged estimation degrades $\\theta$-RMSE by $2.2\\times$ ($\\tau$ drops 9.6pp), directly validating the OVB analysis; continuous gating improves $c_n$-RMSE by 36\\% over binary gating, confirming that modeling contamination magnitude has practical value. Under the balanced $J = 8$ design, removing judge severity $d_j$ has minimal impact ($\\theta$-RMSE $+$1.6\\%); we retain it for theoretical completeness and its independent diagnostic value.\n",

After filtering for full coverage across all judges and target models, the evaluation set contains 176 items in a fully crossed design. Eight target models spanning proprietary and open-source families are evaluated (Table~\\ref{tab:main_results}). Ground-truth rankings are derived from Chatbot Arena human preference data \\citep{zheng2023mtbench}.\n\n\\paragraph{Judges.} Six LLM judge families score all model responses in position-swapped pairwise mode: GPT-5.5, Claude Opus 4.7, Claude Sonnet 4.6, DeepSeek-V4-Pro, Qwen3-235B, and Llama 4 Maverick. Position swapping controls for position bias and doubles the effective observation count.\n\n\\paragraph{Exposure estimation.} Per-item exposure $e_i$ is estimated via a two-source pipeline (\\S\\ref{sec:staged}): reference model anchoring with gpt-4-0314 as anchor (75\\% weight) and cross-model agreement (25\\% weight). The pipeline is robust to weight configuration (Spearman $\\rho \\geq 0.998$ across all configurations tested).\n\n\\paragraph{MCMC.} We use NumPyro NUTS with 4{,}000 warmup and 4{,}000 sampling iterations across 4 chains (target acceptance 0.95). The contamination prior follows the hierarchical HalfNormal specification (Eq.~\\ref{eq:contam_prior}). Convergence is assessed via rank-normalized split-$\\hat{R}$ and bulk/tail ESS \\citep{vehtari2021rhat}.\n\n\\subsection{Baselines and Main Results}\n\\label{sec:main_results}\n\nWe compare G-MFRM against seven methods that address judge bias or contamination separately: (1) Raw Average, (2) MFRM-only (Eq.~\\ref{eq:mfrm}), (3) Sequential pipeline (MFRM then contamination adjustment), (4) CyclicJudge \\citep{cyclicjudge2026}, (5) CyclicJudge+discard (exposed items removed), (6) DCR Factor \\citep{dcr2025}, and (7) Preference Leakage calibration \\citep{preference_leakage2026}.

The most recent models show weak contamination with CIs near zero: GPT-4o ($0.88$ [0.05, 2.20]) and GPT-4o-mini ($0.93$ [0.06, 2.20]). The top-two and bottom-two CIs do not overlap, and the global shrinkage scale $\\hat{\\sigma}_c = 2.40$ [1.70, 3.40] confirms substantial inter-model heterogeneity. The mean $\\bar{c} = 2.50$ aligns with the strong-contamination regime in our synthetic validation, confirming that benchmark contamination in Arena-Hard is non-negligible. Notably, sequential estimation yields near-zero contamination estimates ($\\bar{c} \\approx 0$), demonstrating that without joint modeling, contamination effects are entirely absorbed into ability estimates $\\hat{\\theta}$---precisely the omitted variable bias predicted by the theoretical analysis (Section~\\ref{sec:confounding}). Judge severity $d_j$ separates by provenance: proprietary judges score more strictly (Claude Opus $+0.60$, GPT-5.5 $+0.53$, DeepSeek $+0.31$) than open-source judges (Mistral $-0.74$, LLaMA $-0.42$, Qwen2.5-72B $-0.35$). Results are robust to prior specification: Horseshoe and HalfNormal hierarchical priors yield near-identical point estimates (Pearson $r > 0.999$) despite markedly different convergence properties (Appendix).\n\n\\subsection{Error Propagation Robustness}\n\\label{sec:error_prop_results}\n\nSection~\\ref{sec:error_prop} predicted that ability estimates degrade gracefully when exposure noise $\\sigma$ remains below $\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Var}(e_i)} \\approx 0.2$. We validate this prediction by injecting Gaussian noise into the true exposure values and re-fitting G-MFRM on synthetic data ($N = 50$, $I = 100$, $J = 8$, 20 seeds; exp-012).\n\n\\begin{table}[t]\n\\centering\n\\small\n\\begin{tabular}{lcccc}\n\\toprule\n$\\sigma$ & $\\theta$-RMSE & $\\Delta\\theta$\\% & $c_n$-RMSE & $\\Delta c_n$\\% \\\\\n\\midrule\n0.0 & 0.128 $\\pm$ 0.018 & --- & 0.533 $\\pm$ 0.187 & --- \\\\\n0.1 & 0.130 $\\pm$ 0.018 & +1.4 & 0.545 $\\pm$ 0.192 & +2.3 \\\\\n0.2 & 0.135 $\\pm$ 0.018 & +5.9 & 0.575 $\\pm$ 0.198 & +7.9 \\\\\n0.5 & 0.175 $\\pm$ 0.027 & +36.9 & 0.842 $\\pm$ 0.281 & +57.9 \\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}\n\\caption{Error propagation robustness (exp-012). Ability RMSE degrades by less than 6\\% when exposure noise $\\sigma \\leq 0.2$, matching the theoretical prediction. Contamination estimates are more sensitive due to multiplicative coupling with $e_i$.}\n\\label{tab:error_prop}\n\\end{table}\n\nTable~\\ref{tab:error_prop} confirms the theoretical prediction. Below the threshold ($\\sigma \\leq 0.2$), ability RMSE increases by 5.9\\% and contamination RMSE by 7.9\\%; at $\\sigma = 0.1$, degradation is negligible (1.4\\% and 2.3\\%). Beyond the threshold ($\\sigma = 0.5$), degradation becomes substantial ($+$36.9\\% and $+$57.9\\% respectively). Contamination estimates are more sensitive because $c_n$ enters the likelihood only through its product with $e_i$, while $\\theta_n$ contributes additively. Rank ordering is preserved even at $\\sigma = 0.5$ ($\\tau > 0.88$), validating that practical exposure methods need only achieve moderate accuracy to produce reliable corrections.\n\nTable~\\ref{tab:ablation} (Appendix) reports ablation results on synthetic data ($N = 50$, $I = 100$, $J = 8$). The dominant effect is joint versus staged estimation: staged estimation degrades $\\theta$-RMSE by $2.2\\times$ ($\\tau$ drops 9.6pp), directly validating the OVB analysis; continuous gating improves $c_n$-RMSE by 36\\% over binary gating, confirming that modeling contamination magnitude has practical value. Under the balanced $J = 8$ design, removing judge severity $d_j$ has minimal impact ($\\theta$-RMSE $+$1.6\\%); we retain it for theoretical completeness and its independent diagnostic value.\n",

Contribution 4 says "with nominally improved rank agreement" — this is already quite hedged. The Director said "确保不 overclaim ranking。保持 D021 的 framing". I think this is already fine as-is, since "nominally" already implies it may not be statistically significant. But to be fully consistent with the bootstrap finding, I could add a tiny qualifier. Let me add "nominally improved" → "nominally but not statistically significantly improved" — but that's wordy. Or just keep it as is since the experiments section now has the full bootstrap disclosure.

Actually, Director said "保持 D021 的 framing：'produces the first joint diagnostic...' 为主，ranking 为辅". 

The current framing already achieves this, so I'll leave it as-is rather than over-hedging the contributions. Now let me check the page count.

```text
Page 8: Conclusion ends at the bottom of page 8 with "...not statistically significant at N = 8)." — fits perfectly.

Let me now verify the consistency of numbers across sections and report to Director.

Let me check the consistency tool.

[Director 指令] [Patch 追加] Bootstrap 结果补充数据点

上一条 patch 正在处理中，请在该 patch 基础上补充以下内容（如果已来不及合并，作为独立 patch）：

**额外数据点（experiments.tex bootstrap 段落）**：
1. **τ_gmfrm median = 0.786**（与 baseline 完全相同）——说明点估计 0.857 在后验分布的上尾。写一句："The posterior median τ equals the baseline value (0.786), with the point estimate of 0.857 falling at the upper tail of the posterior distribution"
2. **P(Δτ ≥ 0) = 92.7%**——这是正面信号，G-MFRM 几乎不会恶化排名。写一句："While not significantly improving rankings, G-MFRM almost never degrades them (P(Δτ ≥ 0) = 0.927), indicating monotone non-degradation"
3. **θ diff CI for swap pair = [−0.227, +0.722]**——如果之前 patch 里写了 "85% of posterior draws maintain the ordering"，补充这个 CI

**叙事策略确认**：
- Ranking improvement: "nominally higher point estimate, not significant at N=8"
- Non-degradation: "almost never degrades" (P=0.927) ← 新正面 claim
- 真正贡献: diagnostic outputs (c_n profiles, d_j profiles) + OVB theoretical contribution
- 合成数据: 统计显著 (p=0.002, N=50)
- N=8 limitation: τ resolution = 1/28 ≈ 0.036, inherent discreteness problem

```text
The Director wants me to add 3 additional data points to the bootstrap paragraph in experiments.tex. Let me read the current state of that paragraph and add the new information.

Key additions:
1. τ_gmfrm median = 0.786 (same as baseline, point estimate 0.857 at upper tail)
2. P(Δτ ≥ 0) = 0.927 — non-degradation claim
3. θ diff CI for swap pair = [−0.227, +0.722]

Let me read the current experiments.tex to see exactly what was written in the previous patch.

42	All seven baselines produce identical model rankings ($\tau = 0.786$, $\rho = 0.905$). This reflects the structural confounding from Section~\ref{sec:confounding}: single-facet corrections leave the uncorrected confound intact, producing invariant rank orderings (Observation~\ref{obs:ovb}). G-MFRM achieves nominally higher point-estimate rank agreement ($\tau = 0.857$, $\rho = 0.952$) over the baselines ($\tau = 0.786$), but bootstrap resampling (4{,}000 posterior draws) yields $\Delta\tau$ 95\% CI $[-0.071, 0.071]$, $P(\Delta\tau > 0) = 0.451$: the improvement is not statistically significant at $N = 8$. On synthetic data ($N = 50$), joint estimation significantly outperforms sequential ($\tau = 0.922$ vs.\ $0.826$, Wilcoxon $p = 0.002$), confirming that the effect is real but below detection at this sample size. The rank change---gpt-4o-mini and qwen2.5-72b swap positions---is consistent with differential contamination, with $P(\theta_{\text{mini}} > \theta_{\text{qwen}}) = 0.853$ across posterior draws.
43	
44	The MCMC sampler achieves rank-normalized split-$\hat{R} \leq 1.03$ across all parameters with zero divergent transitions and minimum bulk ESS of 217.\footnote{$\hat{R} = 1.03$ satisfies the traditional 1.05 threshold but exceeds the stricter 1.01 of \citet{vehtari2021rhat}. Rank correlations are stable across chain subsets, suggesting adequate mixing for the ranking task.} Model and judge facets show acceptable fit (all infit/outfit MNSQ within $[0.63, 1.07]$; item-level diagnostics in Appendix). Posterior predictive checks confirm adequate model fit (predicted response rate $0.593$ vs.\ observed $0.599$; Appendix~\ref{app:ppc}). Contamination susceptibility $\hat{c}_n$ exhibits a significant gradient by model age. Four models have 95\% CIs entirely above 1.0: GPT-3.5-Turbo ($5.60$ [4.40, 6.80]), GPT-4-0613 ($4.20$ [3.10, 5.30]), Qwen2.5-72B ($3.00$ [1.40, 4.60]), and LLaMA-3.3-70B ($2.50$ [1.10, 3.90]). Mid-range values appear for Gemma-2-9B ($1.70$) and Qwen3-8B ($1.20$). The most recent models show weak contamination with CIs near zero: GPT-4o ($0.88$ [0.05, 2.20]) and GPT-4o-mini ($0.93$ [0.06, 2.20]). The top-two and bottom-two CIs do not overlap, and the global shrinkage scale $\hat{\sigma}_c = 2.40$ [1.70, 3.40] confirms substantial inter-model heterogeneity. The mean $\bar{c} = 2.50$ aligns with the strong-contamination regime in our synthetic validation, confirming that benchmark contamination in Arena-Hard is non-negligible. Notably, sequential estimation yields near-zero contamination estimates ($\bar{c} \approx 0$), demonstrating that without joint modeling, contamination effects are entirely absorbed into ability estimates $\hat{\theta}$---precisely the omitted variable bias predicted by the theoretical analysis (Section~\ref{sec:confounding}). Judge severity $d_j$ separates by provenance: proprietary judges score more strictly (Claude Opus $+0.60$, GPT-5.5 $+0.53$, DeepSeek $+0.31$) than open-source judges (Mistral $-0.74$, LLaMA $-0.42$, Qwen2.5-72B $-0.35$). Results are robust to prior specification: Horseshoe and HalfNormal hierarchical priors yield near-identical point estimates (Pearson $r > 0.999$) despite markedly different convergence properties (Appendix).

Now I need to integrate 3 data points into the bootstrap paragraph (line 42). Let me carefully edit:

Current bootstrap section:
"G-MFRM achieves nominally higher point-estimate rank agreement ($\tau = 0.857$, $\rho = 0.952$) over the baselines ($\tau = 0.786$), but bootstrap resampling (4{,}000 posterior draws) yields $\Delta\tau$ 95\% CI $[-0.071, 0.071]$, $P(\Delta\tau > 0) = 0.451$: the improvement is not statistically significant at $N = 8$. 

On synthetic data with a larger sample ($N = 50$), joint estimation substantially outperforms the sequential approach ($\tau = 0.922$ vs. $0.826$, Wilcoxon $p = 0.002$), demonstrating the effect is genuine but underpowered at the original sample size. The rank reordering—gpt-4o-mini and qwen2.5-72b exchange positions—aligns with differential contamination patterns, with posterior draws showing $P(\theta_{\text{mini}} > \theta_{\text{qwen}}) = 0.853$. I'm realizing the distinction between these probabilities—P(Δτ > 0) captures strictly positive improvements at 45.1%, while P(Δτ ≥ 0) at 92.7% includes cases where the ranking stays identical. With only 8 models, τ is discrete, so roughly 48% of posterior draws show no change, 45% show improvement, and 7% show degradation. The bootstrap analysis shows the posterior median τ equals the baseline, with the improvement estimate in the upper tail and a confidence interval spanning zero—so while G-MFRM rarely degrades rankings, the gain isn't statistically significant at N=8. On synthetic data with larger sample size, joint estimation decisively outperforms sequential estimation, confirming the effect is real but underpowered in the real experiment, and the rank swap between models aligns with differential contamination patterns. On synthetic data with a larger sample ($N = 50$), joint estimation significantly outperforms the sequential approach, and the effect size is substantial enough to reach statistical significance. The rank reordering between two models appears driven by differential contamination patterns, with credible intervals that span zero but suggest a meaningful posterior probability favoring one model over the other. On synthetic data with a larger sample, the joint approach significantly outperforms sequential estimation, which validates that the effect is genuine despite being undetectable at the current sample size. The rank reordering between two models aligns with the posterior uncertainty around their relative contamination levels. I'm dropping the redundant probability statement since the confidence interval and non-degradation metric already convey the key finding.

    "originalFile": "\\section{Experiments}\n\\label{sec:experiments}\n\n\\subsection{Setup}\n\\label{sec:setup}\n\n\\paragraph{Data and models.} We evaluate on Arena-Hard \\citep{li2024arenahard}, a benchmark of 316 multi-turn conversational items selected for high separability among frontier models. After filtering for full coverage across all judges and target models, the evaluation set contains 176 items in a fully crossed design. Eight target models spanning proprietary and open-source families are evaluated (Table~\\ref{tab:main_results}). Ground-truth rankings are derived from Chatbot Arena human preference data \\citep{zheng2023mtbench}.\n\n\\paragraph{Judges.} Six LLM judge families score all model responses in position-swapped pairwise mode: GPT-5.5, Claude Opus 4.7, Claude Sonnet 4.6, DeepSeek-V4-Pro, Qwen3-235B, and Llama 4 Maverick. Position swapping controls for position bias and doubles the effective observation count.\n\n\\paragraph{Exposure estimation.} Per-item exposure $e_i$ is estimated via a two-source pipeline (\\S\\ref{sec:staged}): reference model anchoring with gpt-4-0314 as anchor (75\\% weight) and cross-model agreement (25\\% weight). The pipeline is robust to weight configuration (Spearman $\\rho \\geq 0.998$ across all configurations tested).\n\n\\paragraph{MCMC.} We use NumPyro NUTS with 4{,}000 warmup and 4{,}000 sampling iterations across 4 chains (target acceptance 0.95). The contamination prior follows the hierarchical HalfNormal specification (Eq.~\\ref{eq:contam_prior}). Convergence is assessed via rank-normalized split-$\\hat{R}$ and bulk/tail ESS \\citep{vehtari2021rhat}.\n\n\\subsection{Baselines and Main Results}\n\\label{sec:main_results}\n\nWe compare G-MFRM against seven methods that address judge bias or contamination separately: (1) Raw Average, (2) MFRM-only (Eq.~\\ref{eq:mfrm}), (3) Sequential pipeline (MFRM then contamination adjustment), (4) CyclicJudge \\citep{cyclicjudge2026}, (5) CyclicJudge+discard (exposed items removed), (6) DCR Factor \\citep{dcr2025}, and (7) Preference Leakage calibration \\citep{preference_leakage2026}. All methods are evaluated by Kendall $\\tau$ and Spearman $\\rho$ against Chatbot Arena human rankings.\n\n\\begin{table}[t]\n\\centering\n\\small\n\\begin{tabular}{lcc}\n\\toprule\n\\textbf{Method} & $\\tau$ & $\\rho$ \\\\\n\\midrule\nRaw Average & 0.786 & 0.905 \\\\\nMFRM-only & 0.786 & 0.905 \\\\\nSequential & 0.786 & 0.905 \\\\\nCyclicJudge & 0.786 & 0.905 \\\\\nCyclicJudge+discard & 0.786 & 0.905 \\\\\nDCR Factor & 0.786 & 0.905 \\\\\nPref.\\ Leakage & 0.786 & 0.905 \\\\\n\\midrule\nG-MFRM (ours) & \\textbf{0.857} & \\textbf{0.952} \\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}\n\\caption{Correlation with Chatbot Arena human rankings on Arena-Hard (8 target models, 6 judges).

This reflects the structural confounding from Section~\\ref{sec:confounding}: single-facet corrections leave the uncorrected confound intact, producing invariant rank orderings (Observation~\\ref{obs:ovb}). G-MFRM achieves nominally higher point-estimate rank agreement ($\\tau = 0.857$, $\\rho = 0.952$) over the baselines ($\\tau = 0.786$), but bootstrap resampling (4{,}000 posterior draws) yields $\\Delta\\tau$ 95\\% CI $[-0.071, 0.071]$, $P(\\Delta\\tau > 0) = 0.451$: the improvement is not statistically significant at $N = 8$. On synthetic data ($N = 50$), joint estimation significantly outperforms sequential ($\\tau = 0.922$ vs.\\ $0.826$, Wilcoxon $p = 0.002$), confirming that the effect is real but below detection at this sample size. The rank change---gpt-4o-mini and qwen2.5-72b swap positions---is consistent with differential contamination, with $P(\\theta_{\\text{mini}} > \\theta_{\\text{qwen}}) = 0.853$ across posterior draws.\n\nThe MCMC sampler achieves rank-normalized split-$\\hat{R} \\leq 1.03$ across all parameters with zero divergent transitions and minimum bulk ESS of 217.\\footnote{$\\hat{R} = 1.03$ satisfies the traditional 1.05 threshold but exceeds the stricter 1.01 of \\citet{vehtari2021rhat}. Rank correlations are stable across chain subsets, suggesting adequate mixing for the ranking task.} Model and judge facets show acceptable fit (all infit/outfit MNSQ within $[0.63, 1.07]$; item-level diagnostics in Appendix). Posterior predictive checks confirm adequate model fit (predicted response rate $0.593$ vs.\\ observed $0.599$; Appendix~\\ref{app:ppc}). Contamination susceptibility $\\hat{c}_n$ exhibits a significant gradient by model age. Four models have 95\\% CIs entirely above 1.0: GPT-3.5-Turbo ($5.60$ [4.40, 6.80]), GPT-4-0613 ($4.20$ [3.10, 5.30]), Qwen2.5-72B ($3.00$ [1.40, 4.60]), and LLaMA-3.3-70B ($2.50$ [1.10, 3.90]). Mid-range values appear for Gemma-2-9B ($1.70$) and Qwen3-8B ($1.20$). The most recent models show weak contamination with CIs near zero: GPT-4o ($0.88$ [0.05, 2.20]) and GPT-4o-mini ($0.93$ [0.06, 2.20]). The top-two and bottom-two CIs do not overlap, and the global shrinkage scale $\\hat{\\sigma}_c = 2.40$ [1.70, 3.40] confirms substantial inter-model heterogeneity. The mean $\\bar{c} = 2.50$ aligns with the strong-contamination regime in our synthetic validation, confirming that benchmark contamination in Arena-Hard is non-negligible. Notably, sequential estimation yields near-zero contamination estimates ($\\bar{c} \\approx 0$), demonstrating that without joint modeling, contamination effects are entirely absorbed into ability estimates $\\hat{\\theta}$---precisely the omitted variable bias predicted by the theoretical analysis (Section~\\ref{sec:confounding}). Judge severity $d_j$ separates by provenance: proprietary judges score more strictly (Claude Opus $+0.60$, GPT-5.5 $+0.53$, DeepSeek $+0.31$) than open-source judges (Mistral $-0.74$, LLaMA $-0.42$, Qwen2.5-72B $-0.35$). Results are robust to prior specification: Horseshoe and HalfNormal hierarchical priors yield near-identical point estimates (Pearson $r > 0.999$) despite markedly different convergence properties (Appendix).\n\n\\subsection{Error Propagation Robustness}\n\\label{sec:error_prop_results}\n\nSection~\\ref{sec:error_prop} predicted that ability estimates degrade gracefully when exposure noise $\\sigma$ remains below $\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Var}(e_i)} \\approx 0.2$. We validate this prediction by injecting Gaussian noise into the true exposure values and re-fitting G-MFRM on synthetic data ($N = 50$, $I = 100$, $J = 8$, 20 seeds; exp-012).\n\n\\begin{table}[t]\n\\centering\n\\small\n\\begin{tabular}{lcccc}\n\\toprule\n$\\sigma$ & $\\theta$-RMSE & $\\Delta\\theta$\\% & $c_n$-RMSE & $\\Delta c_n$\\% \\\\\n\\midrule\n0.0 & 0.128 $\\pm$ 0.018 & --- & 0.533 $\\pm$ 0.187 & --- \\\\\n0.1 & 0.130 $\\pm$ 0.018 & +1.4 & 0.545 $\\pm$ 0.192 & +2.3 \\\\\n0.2 & 0.135 $\\pm$ 0.018 & +5.9 & 0.575 $\\pm$ 0.198 & +7.9 \\\\\n0.5 & 0.175 $\\pm$ 0.027 & +36.9 & 0.842 $\\pm$ 0.281 & +57.9 \\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}\n\\caption{Error propagation robustness (exp-012). Ability RMSE degrades by less than 6\\% when exposure noise $\\sigma \\leq 0.2$, matching the theoretical prediction. Contamination estimates are more sensitive due to multiplicative coupling with $e_i$.}\n\\label{tab:error_prop}\n\\end{table}\n\nTable~\\ref{tab:error_prop} confirms the theoretical prediction. Below the threshold ($\\sigma \\leq 0.2$), ability RMSE increases by 5.9\\% and contamination RMSE by 7.9\\%; at $\\sigma = 0.1$, degradation is negligible (1.4\\% and 2.3\\%). Beyond the threshold ($\\sigma = 0.5$), degradation becomes substantial ($+$36.9\\% and $+$57.9\\% respectively). Contamination estimates are more sensitive because $c_n$ enters the likelihood only through its product with $e_i$, while $\\theta_n$ contributes additively. Rank ordering is preserved even at $\\sigma = 0.5$ ($\\tau > 0.88$), validating that practical exposure methods need only achieve moderate accuracy to produce reliable corrections.\n\nTable~\\ref{tab:ablation} (Appendix) reports ablation results on synthetic data ($N = 50$, $I = 100$, $J = 8$). The dominant effect is joint versus staged estimation: staged estimation degrades $\\theta$-RMSE by $2.2\\times$ ($\\tau$ drops 9.6pp), directly validating the OVB analysis; continuous gating improves $c_n$-RMSE by 36\\% over binary gating, confirming that modeling contamination magnitude has practical value. Under the balanced $J = 8$ design, removing judge severity $d_j$ has minimal impact ($\\theta$-RMSE $+$1.6\\%); we retain it for theoretical completeness and its independent diagnostic value.\n",

Posterior predictive checks confirm adequate model fit (predicted response rate $0.593$ vs.\\ observed $0.599$; Appendix~\\ref{app:ppc}). Contamination susceptibility $\\hat{c}_n$ exhibits a significant gradient by model age. Four models have 95\\% CIs entirely above 1.0: GPT-3.5-Turbo ($5.60$ [4.40, 6.80]), GPT-4-0613 ($4.20$ [3.10, 5.30]), Qwen2.5-72B ($3.00$ [1.40, 4.60]), and LLaMA-3.3-70B ($2.50$ [1.10, 3.90]). Mid-range values appear for Gemma-2-9B ($1.70$) and Qwen3-8B ($1.20$). The most recent models show weak contamination with CIs near zero: GPT-4o ($0.88$ [0.05, 2.20]) and GPT-4o-mini ($0.93$ [0.06, 2.20]). The top-two and bottom-two CIs do not overlap, and the global shrinkage scale $\\hat{\\sigma}_c = 2.40$ [1.70, 3.40] confirms substantial inter-model heterogeneity. The mean $\\bar{c} = 2.50$ aligns with the strong-contamination regime in our synthetic validation, confirming that benchmark contamination in Arena-Hard is non-negligible. Notably, sequential estimation yields near-zero contamination estimates ($\\bar{c} \\approx 0$), demonstrating that without joint modeling, contamination effects are entirely absorbed into ability estimates $\\hat{\\theta}$---precisely the omitted variable bias predicted by the theoretical analysis (Section~\\ref{sec:confounding}). Judge severity $d_j$ separates by provenance: proprietary judges score more strictly (Claude Opus $+0.60$, GPT-5.5 $+0.53$, DeepSeek $+0.31$) than open-source judges (Mistral $-0.74$, LLaMA $-0.42$, Qwen2.5-72B $-0.35$). Results are robust to prior specification: Horseshoe and HalfNormal hierarchical priors yield near-identical point estimates (Pearson $r > 0.999$) despite markedly different convergence properties (Appendix).",

```text
The conclusion still spills slightly onto page 9. The top of page 9 shows: "first joint contamination-susceptibility and judge-severity diagnostic, with nominally higher rank agreement (τ = 0.857 vs. 0.786; not statistically significant at N = 8)."

So about 2 lines of conclusion are on page 9. The experiments section additions may have pushed things down slightly. I need to trim somewhere again.

Looking at page 8, the conclusion starts near the bottom. The experiments text now takes a bit more space. Let me try to trim the conclusion again.

Current conclusion:
"We introduced the Gated Many-Facet Rasch Model (G-MFRM), which jointly estimates model ability, judge severity, and contamination susceptibility by formalizing their confounding as an omitted variable bias problem and resolving it through three-stage estimation with externally fixed exposure, with formal identifiability guarantees and error propagation bounds. 

On Arena-Hard with eight models and six judges, G-MFRM produces the first joint contamination-susceptibility and judge-severity diagnostic, with nominally higher rank agreement (τ = 0.857 vs. 0.786; not statistically significant at N = 8)."

I need to save about 2 lines. Let me try condensing the first sentence by dropping the identifiability and error propagation details, then keeping the empirical result: "We introduced G-MFRM, which jointly estimates model ability, judge severity, and contamination susceptibility by formalizing their confounding as an omitted variable bias problem. On Arena-Hard with eight models and six judges, G-MFRM produces the first joint contamination-susceptibility and judge-severity diagnostic, with nominally higher rank agreement (τ = 0.857 vs. 0.786; not statistically significant at N = 8)."

That saves space by removing the technical guarantees from the first sentence while preserving the core contribution and empirical findings. I'm trying to find the right balance—trimming the conclusion enough to save space without losing critical details about what G-MFRM accomplishes and how it performs, though I'm concerned that cutting too aggressively might obscure the main contributions.

```text
Page 9 starts with "agreement (τ = 0.857 vs. 0.786; not significant at N = 8)." — so the conclusion still has about 1 line spilling over. 

I need to save 1 more line. Let me look at the conclusion text again and make a tiny trim.

Current:
"We introduced G-MFRM, which jointly estimates model ability, judge severity, and contamination susceptibility by formalizing their confounding as omitted variable bias and resolving it through three-stage estimation with externally fixed exposure. On Arena-Hard with eight models and six judges, G-MFRM produces the first joint contamination--severity diagnostic, with nominally higher rank agreement ($\tau = 0.857$ vs.\ $0.786$; not significant at $N = 8$)."
 
I can trim this by dropping the methodological details about three-stage estimation and externally fixed exposure. That phrase is doing a lot of work but isn't essential to the main contribution statement. Removing it saves roughly a line while keeping the core message intact: we formalize the confounding as omitted variable bias, and the result is a joint diagnostic with improved rank agreement.
```

Still the same issue - the conclusion's last line "agreement (τ = 0.857 vs. 0.786; not significant at N = 8)." spills onto page 9. The change from "through" to "via" and removing "with eight models and six judges" → "On Arena-Hard" wasn't enough.

Let me think about what else to trim. Actually, looking more carefully at the top of page 9, I see that the conclusion text continues from page 8. The spill is just 1 line: "agreement (τ = 0.857 vs. 

0.786; not significant at N = 8)."

The real culprit is that the experiments section got longer when I added the bootstrap statistics—median τ, P(Δτ ≥ 0), and the θ-diff confidence intervals. That pushed everything on pages 6-7 down, which cascaded to push Related Work and the Conclusion further back.

I could either remove "and resolving it via three-stage estimation with externally fixed exposure" from the conclusion entirely, or trim something from the experiments paragraph to compensate. Let me check the bootstrap paragraph in the experiments section since that's where I added the new content.

The synthetic data sentence about joint estimation outperforming sequential is already covered elsewhere—it appears in the ablation table and was mentioned in the Introduction when discussing Contribution 3. Since this τ comparison (0.922 vs 0.826 for staged estimation) is redundant with what's already in the ablation paragraph, I can compress or remove it to free up space.

I'm considering two approaches: either shorten the cross-reference to just point back to the error propagation section with the p-value, or compress the entire conclusion down to two sentences that capture the core contribution—introducing G-MFRM as a joint estimation method that formalizes confounding as omitted variable bias, and reporting the Arena-Hard results showing nominally higher rank agreement without the three-stage estimation details.

```text
The page 8 now shows the conclusion ending at the bottom. The last visible text on page 8 reads: "produces the first joint contamination--severity diagnostic, with nominally higher rank agreement" and then the next line should be "($\tau = 0.857$ vs. $0.786$; not significant at $N = 8$)."

Wait, looking more carefully, the very last line on page 8 shows: "(τ = 0.857 vs. 0.786; not significant at N = 8)." — but actually I need to check page 9 to be sure.


Looking at page 8 more carefully, I can see the conclusion section introduces G-MFRM and its approach to jointly estimating model ability, judge severity, and contamination susceptibility, with the final visible line showing the statistical comparison result.

Let me check page 9 to see if the conclusion continues there.

[Director 指令] [Patch] exp-009 OVB 验证图表集成

两个新图已在 `figures/paper/` 目录：

1. **fig4_bias_vs_rho.pdf** → 用于正文 Section 2 或 Experiments 的 OVB 验证段落
   - 内容：sequential bias ~0.19 flat across ρ vs joint bias ~0.06
   - LaTeX: `\includegraphics{figures/paper/fig4_bias_vs_rho.pdf}`
   - Caption 建议："Sequential estimator bias remains approximately constant across confounding levels (ρ), confirming omission-driven rather than confounding-strength-dependent bias. Joint G-MFRM reduces bias by approximately 70% at all ρ levels."

2. **fig5_cn_recovery.pdf** → 用于 Appendix
   - 内容：c_n true vs estimated scatter with 95% CI bars
   - Caption 建议："Contamination susceptibility recovery from 50 Monte Carlo seeds. Empirical CI coverage is 71% (below nominal 95%), indicating moderate posterior overconfidence."

请在合适位置加入 figure 环境。注意 8 页限制——如果正文放不下 fig4，移到 Appendix。

这次不用验证引用。

<details><summary>Logged reasoning block</summary>

```text
Both files exist. Now I need to:

1. Add fig4_bias_vs_rho.pdf to the paper. Given the 8-page limit is extremely tight, I should probably put it in the appendix rather than the main text. Let me check - the Director said "如果正文放不下 fig4，移到 Appendix". Given that we have zero margin on page 8, putting it in main text is impossible. Both figures should go to appendix.

Actually wait - fig4 is about OVB validation which is a key theoretical claim. It would be impactful in the main text. But with zero page margin, it's impossible. 

I'll move both figures to the appendix and add cross-references from the main text. The OVB discussion in Section 2 of background.tex mentions the Monte Carlo simulation confirming constant bias across ρ, so I should reference the appendix figure there. Let me check the current appendix structure to find the best placement.

Good. The background.tex already references "(Appendix)" for the Monte Carlo simulation. I need to:

1. Add fig4 to appendix as a new section (OVB Validation) with cross-reference
2. Add fig5 to appendix as a new section (Contamination Recovery)
3. Update background.tex to reference the specific appendix figure

Let me also check the current appendix section structure:
- §A: Proof of Theorem (app:proof)
- §B: Murphy-Topel (app:murphy_topel)


- §C: Ablation Study (app:ablation)
- §D: Posterior Predictive Check (app:ppc)
- §E: Error Propagation Figure (app:error_prop_fig)

So I'll be adding §F for the OVB validation figure and §G for the contamination recovery figure, both with appropriate cross-references from the main text. I should also verify the graphics path setup in main.tex to ensure the figure files are properly located.

33	
34	The bias combines a specification component from omitting $c_n \cdot e_i$, which persists regardless of confounding, with a confounding component from non-orthogonality between $d_j$ and $c_n \cdot e_i$. Monte Carlo simulation confirms that bias magnitude is approximately constant across confounding levels $\rho \in \{0, 0.3, 0.6, 0.9\}$, indicating that the omission of $c_n \cdot e_i$---not its correlation with $d_j$---is the primary driver (Appendix).
35	
36	This confounding undermines both sequential estimation strategies. A bias-first approach, as in CyclicJudge \citep{cyclicjudge2026}, calibrates $d_j$ before estimating ability, but the resulting $\hat{\theta}$ is already inflated for contaminated models because the omitted $c_n \cdot e_i$ term has been absorbed into the ability estimates. A contamination-first approach, as in DCR \citep{dcr2025}, adjusts for contamination before addressing judge effects, but judge severity is then misattributed as contamination signal. Synthetic validation confirms this failure: with $N = 50$ models, $I = 100$ items, $J = 8$ judges, and 20 random seeds, the Pearson correlation between sequential estimation bias and true $c_n$ reaches $r = 0.86$ ($p < 0.001$). As illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:ovb_bias}, the bias is not random but directional: contaminated models are systematically overestimated under both sequential orderings.

    "originalFile": "\\section{Confounding in LLM Evaluation}\n\\label{sec:confounding}\n\nThe Many-Facet Rasch Model (MFRM) extends classical Rasch measurement to settings with multiple rater facets \\citep{linacre1989mfrm, linacre1994mfrm}. Originating in educational measurement, the model treats rater variation as a nuisance facet to be estimated and removed rather than a source of noise to be averaged over. In the LLM evaluation context, where $J$ judges score $N$ models across $I$ items, the MFRM specifies\n%\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{eq:mfrm}\n\\log \\frac{P(Y_{nij} \\geq k \\mid \\theta_n, b_i, d_j, \\tau_k)}{P(Y_{nij} < k \\mid \\theta_n, b_i, d_j, \\tau_k)} = \\theta_n - b_i - d_j - \\tau_k,\n\\end{equation}\n%\nwhere $Y_{nij}$ is the ordinal rating by judge $j$ for model $n$ on item $i$, $\\theta_n$ is the ability of model $n$ ($n = 1, \\ldots, N$), $b_i$ is the difficulty of item $i$ ($i = 1, \\ldots, I$), $d_j$ is the severity of judge $j$ ($j = 1, \\ldots, J$), and $\\tau_k$ is the threshold for category $k$. All facets reside on a common logit scale, so model ability is directly comparable after adjustment for item difficulty and judge severity. \\citet{jiao2025mfrm_llm} applied this framework to compare ten LLM raters with human experts, showing that MFRM separates genuine ability from systematic judge effects in multi-judge panels.\n\nHowever, standard MFRM assumes that all systematic sources of score variation are captured by the modeled facets. This assumption breaks down when some models have been exposed to benchmark items during training \\citep{dcr2025}. Such contamination inflates scores on exposed items through memorization rather than genuine ability. We represent this effect as an interaction $c_n \\cdot e_i$, where $c_n \\geq 0$ is the contamination susceptibility of model $n$ and $e_i \\in [0, 1]$ is the exposure level of item $i$. The complete data-generating process becomes\n%\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{eq:full}\n\\eta_{nijk} = \\theta_n - b_i - d_j - \\tau_k + c_n \\cdot e_i.\n\\end{equation}\n%\nWhen a practitioner fits the standard MFRM (Eq.~\\ref{eq:mfrm}) to data generated by Eq.~\\ref{eq:full}, the contamination term is absent from the estimated model. Its influence does not vanish but is absorbed into the estimated parameters $\\tilde{\\theta}_n$, $\\tilde{b}_i$, and $\\tilde{d}_j$, which distorts all downstream inferences.\n\nThe consequence of this omission can be stated precisely.\n\n\\begin{observation}[Omitted Variable Bias in MFRM]\n\\label{obs:ovb}\nLet the full model be $\\eta_{nijk} = \\theta_n - b_i - d_j - \\tau_k + c_n \\cdot e_i$ and the short model omit the contamination term: $\\tilde{\\eta}_{nijk} = \\tilde{\\theta}_n - \\tilde{b}_i - \\tilde{d}_j - \\tau_k$. Under a linear approximation to the ordinal logit link \\citep{wooldridge2010, angrist2009mostly},\\footnote{The OVB formula is exact for linear models. We apply it to the MFRM linear predictor $\\eta$, which is an approximation. Synthetic validation confirms the approximation quality: the Pearson correlation between the predicted bias direction and empirical bias reaches $r = 0.86$ ($p < 0.001$), indicating that the linear result accurately characterizes bias direction and relative magnitude.}\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{eq:ovb}\n\\mathrm{plim}(\\tilde{\\theta}_n - \\theta_n) = \\gamma_n \\cdot c_n,\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $\\gamma_n$ depends on the projection of the exposure vector $(e_i)$ onto the design matrix of the short model. The bias is non-zero whenever $\\mathrm{Cov}(d_j,\\, c_n \\cdot e_i) \\neq 0$. This captures the confounding component; in the nonlinear MFRM, a specification bias from omitting $c_n \\cdot e_i$ persists even at zero covariance (Section~\\ref{sec:experiments}).\n\\end{observation}\n\nThe bias combines a specification component from omitting $c_n \\cdot e_i$, which persists regardless of confounding, with a confounding component from non-orthogonality between $d_j$ and $c_n \\cdot e_i$. Monte Carlo simulation confirms that bias magnitude is approximately constant across confounding levels $\\rho \\in \\{0, 0.3, 0.6, 0.9\\}$, indicating that the omission of $c_n \\cdot e_i$---not its correlation with $d_j$---is the primary driver (Appendix).\n\nThis confounding undermines both sequential estimation strategies. A bias-first approach, as in CyclicJudge \\citep{cyclicjudge2026}, calibrates $d_j$ before estimating ability, but the resulting $\\hat{\\theta}$ is already inflated for contaminated models because the omitted $c_n \\cdot e_i$ term has been absorbed into the ability estimates. A contamination-first approach, as in DCR \\citep{dcr2025}, adjusts for contamination before addressing judge effects, but judge severity is then misattributed as contamination signal.

As illustrated in Figure~\\ref{fig:ovb_bias}, the bias is not random but directional: contaminated models are systematically overestimated under both sequential orderings.\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{fig2_ovb_bias}\n\\caption{Sequential estimation bias ($\\hat{\\theta}_{\\mathrm{seq}} - \\theta_{\\mathrm{true}}$) versus true contamination susceptibility $c_n$.

[Director 指令] [Patch] W7 ablation 20-seed 最终结果 — Table 4 更新 + d_j 叙事升级

**Table 4 最终数字（20 seeds, 替换 "preliminary 10 seeds"）**:

| Variant | θ-RMSE | θ-τ | c_n-RMSE |
|---------|--------|-----|----------|
| Full G-MFRM | 0.124±0.016 | 0.922±0.010 | 0.593±0.224 |
| −d_j | 0.127±0.016 | 0.922±0.010 | 0.629±0.243 |
| Binary gating | 0.137±0.016 | 0.909±0.014 | 0.833±0.226 |
| Staged estimation | 0.254±0.045 | 0.839±0.035 | 1.382±0.164 |

**Wilcoxon p-values (vs full_gmfrm, 20 seeds)**:
| 对比 | θ-RMSE | θ-τ | c_n-RMSE |
|------|--------|-----|----------|
| −d_j | p=0.245 n.s. | p=0.344 n.s. | **p=0.0002 \*\*\*** |
| Binary | p<0.001 | p<0.001 | p<0.001 |
| Staged | p<0.001 | p<0.001 | p<0.001 |

**d_j 叙事升级（关键修改）**:

之前写的 "边际贡献小，保留因 theoretical completeness"——现在需要升级。20-seed 数据揭示了更精确的 story：

d_j 对 θ 无显著贡献（排名不受影响），但**显著提高 contamination 恢复精度**（c_n-RMSE −7%, p<0.001）。这完美支撑 diagnostic-first framing：d_j 的价值在于诊断，不在排名。

在 Appendix ablation 讨论段落中，替换之前的 "we retain it for theoretical completeness" 为更有力的表述：
"Removing judge severity d_j does not significantly affect ability estimates (θ-τ, p = 0.34), but significantly degrades contamination recovery (c_n-RMSE +7%, p < 0.001), confirming that d_j serves as a diagnostic component that improves contamination estimation precision rather than ranking accuracy."

正文的 ablation summary 句也更新，加入 d_j 对 c_n 的贡献。

移除 "preliminary, 10 seeds" 标注，Table 4 现在是 20-seed final。

这次不用验证引用。

130	\label{tab:ablation}
131	\end{table}
132	
133	The ablation confirms that joint estimation is the primary contributor to G-MFRM's advantage: staged estimation increases $\theta$-RMSE by $2.2\times$ (from 0.124 to 0.273) and $c_n$-RMSE by $2.5\times$ (from 0.544 to 1.341), with $\tau$ dropping from 0.922 to 0.826. This degradation directly reflects the omitted variable bias characterized in Section~\ref{sec:confounding}: when contamination and judge effects are estimated sequentially, the first-stage estimates absorb the unmodeled facet.
134	
135	Replacing continuous exposure $e_i \in [0,1]$ with binary gating ($e_i \in \{0, 1\}$) increases $c_n$-RMSE by 36\% (from 0.544 to 0.739), indicating that graded exposure modeling captures contamination magnitude more precisely than a binary flag. The effect on $\theta$-RMSE is moderate ($+$11\%), suggesting that the binary approximation still captures the dominant contamination signal but loses precision on partially exposed items.
136	
137	Removing judge severity $d_j$ produces minimal degradation ($\theta$-RMSE $+$1.6\%, $\tau$ $-$0.2\%). Under the balanced design with $J = 8$ judges, severity effects are averaged out across the fully crossed matrix, reducing the marginal contribution of explicit $d_j$ estimation. We retain $d_j$ in the full model because (i) the MFRM facet specification is theory-driven rather than data-selected, (ii) the $d_j$ profile provides independent diagnostic value for judge calibration (e.g., Claude Opus $d_j = +0.60$ vs.\ Mistral $-0.74$ in the real-data evaluation), and (iii) unbalanced or sparse designs would amplify judge severity effects.
