2	\begin{abstract}
3	Multi-turn jailbreak attacks distribute adversarial intent across seemingly benign conversational turns, evading per-turn safety filters.
4	We present preliminary findings from a systematic ablation on two encoder architectures that decomposes what enables cross-attack generalization in multi-turn jailbreak detection.
5	On DeBERTa-v3, continued pretraining is the primary mechanism: masked language modeling without labels bridges $\sim$60 percentage points (pp) of the out-of-distribution (OOD) gap (vanilla F1\,=\,0.31$\pm$0.03 $\to$ 0.91$\pm$0.12 on unseen attack types).
6	Cross-encoder validation on RoBERTa shows that domain adaptation is universally beneficial: RoBERTa vanilla achieves F1\,=\,0.981 on structurally simple Deceptive Delight but collapses to 0.466 on multi-persona ActorAttack, while classification-supervised variants maintain F1\,$\geq$\,0.93 on both.
7	Across both encoders, classification supervision reduces cross-seed variance to near-zero (std 0.005) and provides perturbation robustness on DeBERTa (zero degradation at full conversation length vs.\ $\sim$12\,pp for non-adapted models, $n$=76).
8	These results on synthetic conversations from four attack families suggest that domain adaptation universally improves cross-attack generalization, with encoder pretraining method determining the difficulty threshold at which adaptation becomes critical; validation on larger, human-generated datasets is needed.

3	\section{Introduction}
4	\label{sec:introduction}
5	
6	Multi-turn jailbreak attacks pose a qualitatively different threat to large language model (LLM) safety than their single-turn counterparts. Attacks such as Crescendo~\citep{russinovich2024crescendo}, Foot-in-the-Door (FITD)~\citep{fitd2024}, and Deceptive Delight~\citep{deceptivedelight2024} distribute adversarial intent across individually benign turns through rapport building, logical reframing, and incremental escalation. Persuasion is the common mechanism: \citet{zeng2024pap} catalogue 40 persuasion techniques across jailbreak families, and \citet{hagendorff2026reasoning} find identifiable strategies in 97\% of successful attacks. Individual attack turns occupy the same embedding region as benign text~\citep{bullwinkel2025repeng}, rendering per-turn safety filters fundamentally blind.
7	
8	Production classifiers such as Llama Guard~\citep{inan2023llamaguard}, WildGuard~\citep{han2024wildguard}, and ShieldGemma~\citep{zeng2024shieldgemma} operate on individual turns and cannot model manipulation trajectories across exchanges. Recent multi-turn defenses have begun to address conversation-level structure: DeepContext~\citep{deepcontext2026} combines fine-tuned BERT with a multi-layer GRU, BIID~\citep{tong2025biid} infers turn-level intentions, and G-Guard~\citep{gguard2025} applies graph neural networks. These systems achieve reasonable in-distribution performance but are evaluated on single attack families and do not assess cross-dataset OOD transfer. None systematically analyze \emph{why} some representations generalize while others fail. The open question is: \emph{what representation properties enable cross-attack generalization?}
9	
10	A vanilla DeBERTa encoder~\citep{he2021deberta} with temporal aggregation collapses from F1\,=\,1.000 on in-distribution data to F1\,=\,0.312$\pm$0.026 on out-of-distribution (OOD) Deceptive Delight, worsening with more turns (0.628 at turn~1 to 0.312 at full conversation). LLM-as-judge approaches fare no better: GPT-5.5 achieves F1 of only 0.191--0.449 on in-distribution detection with 30--47\% unparseable responses (Appendix~\ref{sec:llm_judge}). Content-level reasoning is insufficient for this task.
11	
12	We built \textbf{DisPeD} (Discourse-level Persuasion Detection), a two-stage framework with seven controlled Stage~1 variants that systematically decompose the mechanism: 9-class persuasion strategy classification, binary classification, scrambled labels, MLM only, topic classification, Wikipedia MLM, and vanilla control (Section~\ref{sec:method}). Each variant isolates a specific factor (domain exposure, classification supervision, label quality, label granularity, or domain specificity) while holding all other components constant.
13	
14	Through this systematic ablation on DeBERTa-v3, we find that domain exposure via continued pretraining bridges $\sim$60 percentage points (pp) of the OOD gap (vanilla 0.31$\pm$0.03 $\to$ MLM 0.91$\pm$0.12), with strong early detection on unseen Deceptive Delight (mean F1\,$\geq$\,0.97 at $K \leq 5$). Classification supervision provides complementary stability: the 9-class model achieves F1\,=\,0.997$\pm$0.005 with near-zero variance at full conversation length. Cross-encoder validation on RoBERTa~\citep{liu2019roberta} shows that domain adaptation is universally beneficial: RoBERTa vanilla achieves F1\,=\,0.981 on Deceptive Delight but collapses to 0.466$\pm$0.163 on structurally distinct ActorAttack~\citep{ren2024actorattack}, while classification-supervised variants maintain F1\,$\geq$\,0.93 on both. Encoder pretraining method determines the difficulty threshold at which adaptation becomes critical: DeBERTa-v3's replaced token detection (RTD)~\citep{he2021deberta} requires adaptation even for simple attacks, while RoBERTa's standard MLM pretraining tolerates simple attacks but fails on structurally complex ones. Across both encoders, classification supervision reduces cross-seed variance to 0.005--0.046.
15	
16	Our contributions on this preliminary study of synthetic multi-turn jailbreak conversations:
17	\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*, itemsep=2pt, topsep=4pt]
18	  \item \textbf{Systematic decomposition.} Seven controlled DeBERTa-v3 variants identify continued pretraining as the primary mechanism for cross-attack generalization on this encoder ($\sim$60\,pp OOD gap bridged by MLM alone). Misaligned supervision (topic classification) actively destabilizes representations.
19	
20	  \item \textbf{Cross-encoder validation.} Domain adaptation is universally beneficial: RoBERTa vanilla achieves F1\,=\,0.981 on Deceptive Delight but collapses to 0.466 on ActorAttack. Encoder pretraining method determines the difficulty threshold at which adaptation becomes critical (Section~\ref{sec:cross_encoder}).
21	
22	  \item \textbf{Complementary role of classification supervision.} Classification adds perturbation robustness (zero degradation at full length on DeBERTa, $n$=76) and interpretable characterization of known attack families, though strategy predictions do not transfer to unseen attacks (Section~\ref{sec:strategy}).
23	
24	  \item \textbf{Three-layer robustness attribution.} Under adversarial paraphrasing on DeBERTa, classification structure suffices at full length; correct and fine-grained labels are jointly required at $K$=2; both properties contribute independently at $K$=1.

Now I have the current state of all files. Let me proceed with the D033 edits:

1. **experiments.tex**: Add ActorAttack perturbation paragraph after L234 + synthesis paragraph
2. **abstract.tex L7**: Scope perturbation claim
3. **introduction.tex L22**: Revise Contribution 3
4. **introduction.tex L24**: Revise Contribution 4
5. **conclusion.tex L6**: Scope perturbation claim

Let me draft all the edits.

### 1. experiments.tex - ActorAttack perturbation paragraph

After L234 ("Non-adapted representations are vulnerable to surface-level perturbation at early prefixes where detection is most critical."), I need to add:


Now I'm looking at the ActorAttack perturbation results across different model variants. The performance drops significantly under perturbation—particularly for the 9-class model with a -0.204 average drop and binary classification dropping -0.353—though the data-augmented models still maintain an advantage over vanilla. The robustness ordering shifts under perturbation, with scrambled representations degrading least while binary suffers most, and McNemar's test confirms these differences are statistically significant.

The multi-persona signals appear more vulnerable to this type of attack, suggesting that the distributed representations learned through data augmentation may be more sensitive to perturbations than I initially expected. This points to an important trade-off: while augmentation improves in-distribution and domain-shifted performance, it comes at a cost when facing adversarial perturbations, and the vulnerability pattern depends heavily on the attack structure itself. The pattern breaks down with ActorAttack—where persuasion spreads across multiple persona shifts, paraphrasing disrupts the inter-turn coordination that the model depends on, causing degradation across all variants. The three-layer robustness mechanism (classification structure, correct labels at K=2, both at K=1) holds for concentrated attacks like Crescendo and Deceptive Delight but fails to generalize to distributed multi-persona structures, suggesting that classification-supervised robustness may be specific to how attack signals are organized rather than universally protective.

Now I'm checking the performance deltas more carefully—the 9-class model shows -20.4pp, binary drops to -35.3pp, and scrambled sits at -17.2pp, with MLM at -35.3pp and vanilla at -11.6pp. The seed variance across runs is substantial (ranging from -1.3pp to -30.3pp), and the 9-class perturbed F1 reaches 0.768 with McNemar significance at p<0.001 against vanilla. Let me verify the vanilla calculation—if clean performance is 0.258 and the delta is -0.116, that puts perturbed performance at 0.142, which seems reasonable given the attack strength. Now I'm laying out the specific performance drops across variants on the OOD dataset—9-class shows the largest variance across seeds while scrambled proves most robust, though all models degrade substantially. The key point is that despite these drops, the domain-adapted models still maintain a meaningful advantage over vanilla even under perturbation.

Looking at the attack-structure dependency: paraphrasing on DD preserves the discourse flow that adapted models rely on, but ActorAttack's distributed persuasion across persona shifts breaks those inter-turn patterns in ways that surface-level rephrasing can't protect against. The three-layer robustness mechanism I identified earlier holds for some datasets but doesn't extend to ActorAttack. I'm checking the Director's feedback on Claim 3 — the ActorAttack perturbation results show significant degradation across all variants (9-class drops by 0.204±0.135, binary by 0.353, scrambled by 0.172), which contrasts sharply with the DD OOD results that stayed near zero. This means I need to rewrite that claim substantially. Now I'm looking at the abstract revision for line 7, where I need to narrow the scope to just IID and DD results while acknowledging the ActorAttack findings separately. I'm refining the contribution statement to be more precise about where classification supervision helps and where it falls short. The key insight is that robustness gains are limited to attacks with concentrated adversarial patterns, while structurally complex attacks like ActorAttack still cause significant degradation across all variants. I should also preserve the point about strategy predictions not transferring to unseen attacks, since that's a distinct limitation worth highlighting. I'm working through the specifics of how classification helps with robustness. On concentrated attack structures like IID Crescendo and Deceptive Delight, it provides zero degradation at full length, but on the multi-persona ActorAttack variant, everything degrades significantly under paraphrasing—up to 35 percentage points. The strategy predictions don't generalize to any unseen attacks, which is an important limitation to call out. I'm refining the conclusion to be more concise—the robustness findings are attack-dependent, with classification-supervised models showing resilience on concentrated attacks but struggling against multi-persona variants, though domain adaptation still provides meaningful advantages under perturbation. Now I should check whether the limitations section needs updating to reflect these nuances.

Looking at the Director's checklist, the focus is on scoping perturbation claims in the abstract and conclusion, adding the ActorAttack perturbation paragraph and synthesis section to experiments, and revising the contributions in the introduction—no changes needed to limitations. I'll proceed with the listed edits. Now I'm verifying the numerical results across different model variants and perturbation types to make sure everything's consistent—the performance drops range from around 11 to 35 percentage points depending on the approach, and the F1 scores check out when I work backward from the deltas.

Encoder pretraining method determines the difficulty threshold at which adaptation becomes critical, not whether adaptation is needed. Across both encoders, classification supervision reduces cross-seed variance to near-zero, provides perturbation robustness on DeBERTa with a three-layer attribution, and enables interpretable characterization of known attack families (though strategy predictions do not transfer to unseen attacks, OOD $\\kappa$=0.126). On structurally complex ActorAttack, all three classification-supervised variants remain equivalent (0.951--0.990), confirming that label quality is not a factor for detection at any OOD difficulty level. Validation on larger and more diverse datasets is needed.\n\n\\section{Limitations}\n\\label{sec:limitations}\n\n\\paragraph{Dataset scale and diversity.}\nThe training set contains 500 synthetic conversations generated by a single model (Qwen3-8B), and OOD evaluation covers three attack families (FITD, Deceptive Delight, ActorAttack). This scale limits statistical power: the perturbation evaluation ($n$=76) means tier boundaries in Table~\\ref{tab:perturbation} correspond to 1--3 misclassifications. Whether the observed patterns generalize to human-generated attacks, additional attack families, or larger datasets remains an open question.\n\n\\paragraph{Lexical separability.}\nTF-IDF logistic regression achieves F1 = 0.944 on OOD Deceptive Delight without any neural representation learning. This strong bag-of-words baseline indicates substantial lexical separability in the current evaluation data. We cannot conclusively distinguish whether DisPeD's continued pretraining captures pragmatic discourse features or primarily exploits lexical cues that TF-IDF also captures. Probing experiments that test whether the learned representations encode discourse-level structure beyond lexical overlap are needed to resolve this question and are left for future work.\n\n\\paragraph{Strategy annotation quality.}\nPersuasion strategy labels are produced by Qwen3-8B with structured prompting. Inter-annotator agreement with a human sample ($n$=50) yields Cohen's $\\kappa$=0.78, which indicates substantial but imperfect agreement. The small human validation sample and reliance on a single annotator model limit confidence in label quality. We plan to release the annotation prompts and data to enable independent verification.\n\n\\paragraph{OOD strategy prediction.}\nWhile the 9-class model achieves high detection F1 on OOD attacks (0.997$\\pm$0.005 on Deceptive Delight), its strategy-level predictions do not generalize: OOD strategy accuracy is 30.7\\% ($\\kappa$=0.126). The interpretability provided by the persuasion taxonomy is currently limited to known attack families where strategy labels are reliable. This dissociation between detection generalization and strategy prediction generalization confirms that detection operates through domain-adapted representations rather than strategy classification accuracy.\n\n\\paragraph{Single-seed variants.}\nMean pooling results report a single-seed (seed 42) evaluation. Multi-seed validation is needed to confirm this preliminary finding.\n\n\\paragraph{Scope.}\nOnly persuasion-mediated multi-turn attacks fall within scope. Single-turn token-level attacks~\\citep{zou2023gcg}, non-persuasive multi-turn strategies, and attacks targeting modalities other than text are not addressed. The user-only input assumption (excluding assistant responses) may miss information in attacks where the model's own responses contribute to the escalation trajectory.\n\n\\paragraph{Computation cost.}\nStage~1 continued pretraining requires approximately 30 minutes on a single A100 GPU per variant. Stage~2 training completes in under 5 minutes. Total pipeline cost for all seven variants is under 4 GPU-hours, making the approach accessible for replication.\n",

Attacks such as Crescendo~\\citep{russinovich2024crescendo}, Foot-in-the-Door (FITD)~\\citep{fitd2024}, and Deceptive Delight~\\citep{deceptivedelight2024} distribute adversarial intent across individually benign turns through rapport building, logical reframing, and incremental escalation. Persuasion is the common mechanism: \\citet{zeng2024pap} catalogue 40 persuasion techniques across jailbreak families, and \\citet{hagendorff2026reasoning} find identifiable strategies in 97\\% of successful attacks. Individual attack turns occupy the same embedding region as benign text~\\citep{bullwinkel2025repeng}, rendering per-turn safety filters fundamentally blind.\n\nProduction classifiers such as Llama Guard~\\citep{inan2023llamaguard}, WildGuard~\\citep{han2024wildguard}, and ShieldGemma~\\citep{zeng2024shieldgemma} operate on individual turns and cannot model manipulation trajectories across exchanges. Recent multi-turn defenses have begun to address conversation-level structure: DeepContext~\\citep{deepcontext2026} combines fine-tuned BERT with a multi-layer GRU, BIID~\\citep{tong2025biid} infers turn-level intentions, and G-Guard~\\citep{gguard2025} applies graph neural networks. These systems achieve reasonable in-distribution performance but are evaluated on single attack families and do not assess cross-dataset OOD transfer. None systematically analyze \\emph{why} some representations generalize while others fail. The open question is: \\emph{what representation properties enable cross-attack generalization?}\n\nA vanilla DeBERTa encoder~\\citep{he2021deberta} with temporal aggregation collapses from F1\\,=\\,1.000 on in-distribution data to F1\\,=\\,0.312$\\pm$0.026 on out-of-distribution (OOD) Deceptive Delight, worsening with more turns (0.628 at turn~1 to 0.312 at full conversation). LLM-as-judge approaches fare no better: GPT-5.5 achieves F1 of only 0.191--0.449 on in-distribution detection with 30--47\\% unparseable responses (Appendix~\\ref{sec:llm_judge}). Content-level reasoning is insufficient for this task.\n\nWe built \\textbf{DisPeD} (Discourse-level Persuasion Detection), a two-stage framework with seven controlled Stage~1 variants that systematically decompose the mechanism: 9-class persuasion strategy classification, binary classification, scrambled labels, MLM only, topic classification, Wikipedia MLM, and vanilla control (Section~\\ref{sec:method}). Each variant isolates a specific factor (domain exposure, classification supervision, label quality, label granularity, or domain specificity) while holding all other components constant.\n\nThrough this systematic ablation on DeBERTa-v3, we find that domain exposure via continued pretraining bridges $\\sim$60 percentage points (pp) of the OOD gap (vanilla 0.31$\\pm$0.03 $\\to$ MLM 0.91$\\pm$0.12), with strong early detection on unseen Deceptive Delight (mean F1\\,$\\geq$\\,0.97 at $K \\leq 5$). Classification supervision provides complementary stability: the 9-class model achieves F1\\,=\\,0.997$\\pm$0.005 with near-zero variance at full conversation length. Cross-encoder validation on RoBERTa~\\citep{liu2019roberta} shows that domain adaptation is universally beneficial: RoBERTa vanilla achieves F1\\,=\\,0.981 on Deceptive Delight but collapses to 0.466$\\pm$0.163 on structurally distinct ActorAttack~\\citep{ren2024actorattack}, while classification-supervised variants maintain F1\\,$\\geq$\\,0.93 on both. Encoder pretraining method determines the difficulty threshold at which adaptation becomes critical: DeBERTa-v3's replaced token detection (RTD)~\\citep{he2021deberta} requires adaptation even for simple attacks, while RoBERTa's standard MLM pretraining tolerates simple attacks but fails on structurally complex ones. Across both encoders, classification supervision reduces cross-seed variance to 0.005--0.046.\n\nOur contributions on this preliminary study of synthetic multi-turn jailbreak conversations:\n\\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*, itemsep=2pt, topsep=4pt]\n  \\item \\textbf{Systematic decomposition.} Seven controlled DeBERTa-v3 variants identify continued pretraining as the primary mechanism for cross-attack generalization on this encoder ($\\sim$60\\,pp OOD gap bridged by MLM alone).

    "originalFile": "% introduction.tex — expanded for 8-page target\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{sec:introduction}\n\nMulti-turn jailbreak attacks pose a qualitatively different threat to large language model (LLM) safety than their single-turn counterparts. Attacks such as Crescendo~\\citep{russinovich2024crescendo}, Foot-in-the-Door (FITD)~\\citep{fitd2024}, and Deceptive Delight~\\citep{deceptivedelight2024} distribute adversarial intent across individually benign turns through rapport building, logical reframing, and incremental escalation. Persuasion is the common mechanism: \\citet{zeng2024pap} catalogue 40 persuasion techniques across jailbreak families, and \\citet{hagendorff2026reasoning} find identifiable strategies in 97\\% of successful attacks. Individual attack turns occupy the same embedding region as benign text~\\citep{bullwinkel2025repeng}, rendering per-turn safety filters fundamentally blind.\n\nProduction classifiers such as Llama Guard~\\citep{inan2023llamaguard}, WildGuard~\\citep{han2024wildguard}, and ShieldGemma~\\citep{zeng2024shieldgemma} operate on individual turns and cannot model manipulation trajectories across exchanges. Recent multi-turn defenses have begun to address conversation-level structure: DeepContext~\\citep{deepcontext2026} combines fine-tuned BERT with a multi-layer GRU, BIID~\\citep{tong2025biid} infers turn-level intentions, and G-Guard~\\citep{gguard2025} applies graph neural networks. These systems achieve reasonable in-distribution performance but are evaluated on single attack families and do not assess cross-dataset OOD transfer. None systematically analyze \\emph{why} some representations generalize while others fail. The open question is: \\emph{what representation properties enable cross-attack generalization?}\n\nA vanilla DeBERTa encoder~\\citep{he2021deberta} with temporal aggregation collapses from F1\\,=\\,1.000 on in-distribution data to F1\\,=\\,0.312$\\pm$0.026 on out-of-distribution (OOD) Deceptive Delight, worsening with more turns (0.628 at turn~1 to 0.312 at full conversation). LLM-as-judge approaches fare no better: GPT-5.5 achieves F1 of only 0.191--0.449 on in-distribution detection with 30--47\\% unparseable responses (Appendix~\\ref{sec:llm_judge}). Content-level reasoning is insufficient for this task.\n\nWe built \\textbf{DisPeD} (Discourse-level Persuasion Detection), a two-stage framework with seven controlled Stage~1 variants that systematically decompose the mechanism: 9-class persuasion strategy classification, binary classification, scrambled labels, MLM only, topic classification, Wikipedia MLM, and vanilla control (Section~\\ref{sec:method}). Each variant isolates a specific factor (domain exposure, classification supervision, label quality, label granularity, or domain specificity) while holding all other components constant.\n\nThrough this systematic ablation on DeBERTa-v3, we find that domain exposure via continued pretraining bridges $\\sim$60 percentage points (pp) of the OOD gap (vanilla 0.31$\\pm$0.03 $\\to$ MLM 0.91$\\pm$0.12), with strong early detection on unseen Deceptive Delight (mean F1\\,$\\geq$\\,0.97 at $K \\leq 5$). Classification supervision provides complementary stability: the 9-class model achieves F1\\,=\\,0.997$\\pm$0.005 with near-zero variance at full conversation length. Cross-encoder validation on RoBERTa~\\citep{liu2019roberta} shows that domain adaptation is universally beneficial: RoBERTa vanilla achieves F1\\,=\\,0.981 on Deceptive Delight but collapses to 0.466$\\pm$0.163 on structurally distinct ActorAttack~\\citep{ren2024actorattack}, while classification-supervised variants maintain F1\\,$\\geq$\\,0.93 on both.

[Director 指令] [Patch 修正 — D034 取代 D033，Claim 3 结构性调整]

**重要：D033 的 Patch 指令作废，以本条为准。**

Reviewer 独立审查后发现 D033 方案存在 rationalization 风险。最终决策（D034）：

**结构性变更**：
1. **旧 Claim 3（perturbation robustness）降级为 Discussion/Analysis finding**，不再作为核心 Claim
2. **新 Claim 3 = Cross-seed Stability**：classification supervision reduces cross-seed variance 4-20x vs MLM（DD: 9-class std=0.005 vs MLM std=0.115; ActorAttack: 0.026 vs 0.080）。这在两个 OOD 家族都成立，无泛化失败。
3. **McNemar perturbation positive 吸收进 Claim 1**：DA 的检测优势在扰动下依然显著（McNemar p<0.001），作为 Claim 1 的自然延伸
4. **perturbation robustness 在 Discussion 中诚实呈现**：DD 上 Δ≈0，ActorAttack 上所有变体退化，acknowledged as limitation + open question

**影响章节**：
- Abstract: Claim 3 描述从 perturbation robustness → cross-seed stability
- Introduction: Contribution 列表第 3 条改为 stability finding
- Results/Experiments: perturbation 结果保留但移到 Analysis/Discussion subsection，加入 ActorAttack 数据
- Discussion: 加 "perturbation robustness is attack-family-dependent" 段落（诚实负向结果 + limitation）
- Conclusion: 第 3 个贡献改为 stability

**禁忌**（Reviewer 明确指出）：
- 不得写 "This is a finding, not a limitation"
- 不得把 "relative robustness under perturbation" 包装成独立贡献（那是 Claim 1 的推论）
- 不得给 "attack-structure-dependent robustness" 的机制解释（distributed signals vulnerable to paraphrasing）做 claim 级别的论证——这是 post-hoc hypothesis，只能作为 speculation

paper_framing.md 已全面更新。这次不用验证引用。

Automated behaviors (\"from now on when X\", \"each time X\", \"whenever X\", \"before/after X\") require hooks configured in settings.json - the harness executes these, not Claude, so memory/preferences cannot fulfill them. Also use for: permissions (\"allow X\", \"add permission\", \"move permission to\"), env vars (\"set X=Y\"), hook troubleshooting, or any changes to settings.json/settings.local.json files. Examples: \"allow npm commands\", \"add bq permission to global settings\", \"move permission to user settings\", \"set DEBUG=true\", \"when claude stops show X\".

```text
This is a significant structural change. D033's edits are being replaced by D034. Let me understand the changes:

1. Old Claim 3 (perturbation robustness) → demoted to Discussion/Analysis finding
2. New Claim 3 = Cross-seed stability (classification supervision reduces variance 4-20x vs MLM)
3. McNemar perturbation positive → absorbed into Claim 1 (DA detection advantage persists under perturbation)
4. Perturbation robustness → honest presentation in Discussion (DD Δ≈0, AA all degrade, acknowledged as limitation)


5. Now I need to trace through the affected sections—Abstract, Introduction, Experiments, Discussion, and Conclusion—to see what D033 left behind and plan the restructuring accordingly.

Let me start by reviewing the current state of the experiments section since D033 heavily modified the perturbation analysis, then check the updated framing document to understand the new direction before executing the edits.

A Systematic Decomposition of Cross-Attack Generalization\\n\\n## Core Insight (D030 — post-ActorAttack universal DA reframe)\\nDomain adaptation universally improves cross-attack generalization across encoder architectures; encoder pretraining determines the difficulty threshold at which adaptation becomes critical. Systematic ablation across two encoders (DeBERTa-v3, RoBERTa) and three OOD attack families (DD, FITD, ActorAttack) reveals:\\n\\n**On Deceptive Delight (moderate OOD)**: DeBERTa vanilla collapses (F1=0.31±0.03), continued pretraining bridges ~60pp (MLM=0.91±0.12), classification achieves 0.997±0.005. RoBERTa vanilla already succeeds (0.981±0.026) — hierarchy is flat. Scrambled=binary=9-class (all 0.997±0.005).\\n\\n**On ActorAttack (hard OOD)**: RoBERTa vanilla ALSO collapses (0.466±0.163), proving \\\"no DA needed\\\" was DD-specific. DeBERTa vanilla=0.258±0.000. Both encoders benefit from DA: DeBERTa 9-class=0.972±0.026, RoBERTa 9-class=0.939±0.046. Binary (0.990±0.008) ≈ 9-class (0.972±0.026) ≈ scrambled (0.951±0.043) — all three classification variants equivalent at Full (max gap 3.9pp, variance intervals fully overlap, n=3). Label quality is not a significant factor on ActorAttack, consistent with DD findings (D032).\\n\\n**Cross-encoder CKA (D029)**: Both MLM and 9-class reshape representations substantially (centered CKA < 0.5 vs vanilla), but representation change magnitude ≠ detection improvement. RoBERTa MLM changes more (CKA=0.393) yet gains only 0.6pp; DeBERTa MLM changes less (CKA=0.442) yet gains 60pp. The starting point determines the return on adaptation.\\n\\n**Key nuances**: (1) Binary ≈ 9-class ≈ scrambled on ActorAttack Full (0.990 vs 0.972 vs 0.951, all within noise at n=3; D032). Label quality is not a detection-relevant factor on any OOD difficulty. (2) Classification supervision consistently reduces cross-seed variance 4-20x (Claim 3): 9-class std=0.005-0.026 vs MLM std=0.080-0.115, across both DD and ActorAttack. (3) Perturbation robustness is attack-family-dependent (Discussion finding): DD OOD Δ≈0, ActorAttack Δ=-0.17 to -0.35 for ALL variants. DA detection advantage survives perturbation (McNemar p<0.001) as Claim 1 corollary.\\n\\n## Novelty Positioning (D030 reframe)\\nNOT: \\\"Persuasion-aware fine-tuning is the critical ingredient\\\" (MLM control falsified this on DD).\\nNOT: \\\"RoBERTa doesn't need domain adaptation\\\" (ActorAttack falsified this — D030).\\nNOT: \\\"Label quality matters on hard attacks\\\" (3-seed ActorAttack: binary 0.990 ≈ 9-class 0.972 ≈ scrambled 0.951, all within noise; D032).\\nNOT: \\\"Perturbation robustness generalizes across attack families\\\" (exp6 falsified: DD Δ≈0 but ActorAttack Δ=-0.17 to -0.35 for all variants).\\nYES: \\\"We systematically decompose cross-attack generalization across two encoder architectures and three OOD attack families. The key finding: domain adaptation universally improves generalization, but the benefit depends on encoder pretraining × attack structural complexity. On moderate OOD (DD), RoBERTa succeeds without adaptation while DeBERTa requires it; on structurally complex attacks (ActorAttack), both encoders require adaptation. Classification supervision provides complementary benefits: cross-seed stability (std reduced 4-20x vs MLM, consistent across DD and ActorAttack) and interpretability via strategy trajectories. DA's detection advantage survives adversarial perturbation (McNemar p<0.001), though absolute perturbation robustness is attack-family-dependent. Label quality (correct vs scrambled vs binary) does not significantly affect detection at any OOD difficulty level (D032).\\\"\\n\\n## Inherent Lexical Separability (D009)\\nPersuasive jailbreak conversations and general benign conversations are inherently lexically separable (TF-IDF≈1.0 on ALL data sources including real WildChat). TF-IDF remains strong even OOD (F1=0.94 on DD). The paper acknowledges this and positions DisPeD's value as: (1) bridging the vanilla temporal modeling gap (+72pp on DD), (2) cross-seed stability (std 4-20x smaller than MLM variants), (3) interpretability via strategy trajectories.\\n\\n## Comprehensive Ablation Picture (D014, updated D019/D020)\\nSystematic ablation reveals the method's actual mechanism:\\n- **Critical**: Domain exposure on jailbreak text (any form: MLM, scrambled, persuasion) — bridges OOD gap from F1=0.28 to F1≈1.0\\n- **Harmful**: Misaligned classification objective (topic: F1=0.54±0.21, -37pp vs MLM) — constrains representations toward irrelevant features\\n- **Non-critical**: Label granularity (binary≈scrambled≈9-class, 1-6pp gap on DD), Lambda tuning (all F1=1.0), Temporal modeling (mean pooling≈GRU on DD), Classification supervision itself (MLM Full=0.91±0.12 without any labels, K≤5 ≥0.97)\\n- **Implication**: Domain exposure is the mechanism. Classification supervision is neither necessary nor sufficient — misaligned tasks hurt, aligned/random tasks don't help beyond MLM. 9-class taxonomy provides interpretability, not detection advantage.\\n\\n## Core Claims (3, priority-ordered — D019 reframe, D034 Claim 3 restructure)\\n\\n### Claim 1 (PRIMARY): Domain Exposure Bridges the Cross-Attack OOD Gap\\nVanilla DeBERTa catastrophically fails on unseen attack types (F1=0.28 on DD). Domain-adaptive continued pretraining on jailbreak conversation text bridges this gap completely (F1=1.0, +72pp). The critical finding: even MLM without any classification labels achieves F1=1.0 on DD (plan_017), proving that domain exposure alone is sufficient. Misaligned classification (topic, plan_016v2) achieves only F1=0.73, showing that irrelevant task objectives constrain representations harmfully. Complete evidence hierarchy (DD Full F1, multi-seed): vanilla (0.28) < topic (0.54±0.21) < wiki-MLM (0.90±0.12) ≈ JB-MLM (0.91±0.12) < TF-IDF (0.94) < scrambled (0.99) ≈ binary (0.99) ≪ 9-class (1.00±0.005).\\n- Evidence: plan_017 MLM DD — 3-seed Full=0.914±0.115, K≤5 ≥0.97 (no classification labels)\\n- Evidence: plan_018 wiki-MLM DD — 3-seed Full=0.904±0.115, ≈ JB-MLM (domain specificity not significant at Full)\\n- Evidence: plan_016v2 topic DD — 3-seed 0.541±0.207 (misaligned classification hurts vs MLM)\\n- Evidence: plan_006 DD — Treatment F1=1.0, Baseline=0.28 (+72pp)\\n- Evidence: plan_006 scrambled DD — F1=0.935-0.990 (labels non-essential)\\n- Evidence: plan_013 binary DD — F1=0.99 (label granularity non-essential)\\n- Evidence: exp6 perturbation — DA detection advantage survives adversarial perturbation (9-class perturbed ActorAttack=0.768 >> vanilla=0.248, McNemar p<0.001). Domain adaptation's generalization benefit is not erased by paraphrasing attacks.\\n- Strength: very strong — MLM control is the definitive causal test; topic control adds nuance; perturbation survival confirms robustness of DA benefit\\n\\n### Claim 2 (ANALYSIS): Persuasion Taxonomy as Interpretability Layer\\nWhile the persuasion classification task does not contribute to detection performance, the 9-class taxonomy provides interpretability that MLM cannot: different attack types exhibit distinct strategy trajectories (Crescendo: gradual escalation 0.86→5.64, DD: emotional-manipulation→role-assignment, FITD: commitment patterns). This is the taxonomy's sole surviving value after the MLM control result.\\n- Evidence: plan_008 strategy transition matrices\\n- Evidence: plan_017 falsifies detection contribution, confirming interpretability-only role\\n- Strength: descriptive/analytical; interpretability value independent of detection mechanism\\n\\n### Claim 3 (EMPIRICAL): Classification Supervision Provides Cross-Seed Stability\\nClassification supervision reduces cross-seed variance by 4-20x compared to MLM-only pretraining, across BOTH OOD attack families. 9-class std=0.005 (DD) / 0.026 (ActorAttack) vs JB-MLM std=0.115 (DD) / 0.080 (ActorAttack). Binary and scrambled variants also achieve low variance (0.005-0.043). This holds universally — no attack-family dependence, unlike perturbation robustness.\\n- Evidence: 9-class DD 0.997±0.005 vs JB-MLM 0.914±0.115 (std 23x smaller)\\n- Evidence: 9-class ActorAttack 0.972±0.026 vs JB-MLM 0.893±0.080 (std 3x smaller)\\n- Evidence: wiki-MLM 0.904±0.115 — out-of-domain MLM equally unstable\\n- Implication: Classification supervision (even with scrambled labels) stabilizes GRU-level downstream performance. Deployment significance: high seed stability = predictable model behavior across random initializations.\\n- Strength: strong — consistent across 2 OOD families, 7 encoder variants, 3 seeds each\\n\\n### Perturbation Robustness (DISCUSSION FINDING — demoted from Claim, D033/D034)\\nAdversarial perturbation robustness does NOT generalize across attack families. On DD OOD, classification variants show near-zero degradation (Δ≈0 at K≥2). On ActorAttack, ALL variants degrade substantially: 9-class Δ_full=-0.204±0.135, binary -0.353, scrambled -0.172, MLM -0.353, vanilla -0.116.\\n- DD robustness attribution (D026, holds on DD only): classification structure → Full/K≥3 Δ=0; correct+fine-grained → K=2 Δ=0; both contribute at K=1.\\n- ActorAttack: three-layer attribution does NOT hold. Hierarchy reverses (scrambled -0.172 < 9-class -0.204 < binary -0.353).\\n- DA detection advantage persists under perturbation (9-class perturbed=0.768 >> vanilla=0.248, McNemar p<0.001) — this is a corollary of Claim 1, not an independent robustness claim.\\n- 9-class ActorAttack perturbation has extreme seed variance: seed123=-0.013, seed42=-0.296, seed456=-0.303 (std=0.135).\\n- **Limitation**: Absolute perturbation robustness (Δ≈0) only verified on DD OOD. ActorAttack shows all variants degrade. Mechanism hypothesis (distributed multi-turn signals more vulnerable to paraphrasing than concentrated attacks) is post-hoc and unverified — future work.\\n- Caveat (Reviewer #53): DD perturbation n=76, small sample.\\n\\n## Story Spine (D019 reframe)\\n\\n**Problem**: Multi-turn jailbreak attacks distribute adversarial intent across individually benign turns. Bullwinkel et al. (2025) show per-turn representations are deliberately kept in a \\\"benign\\\" region. DeepContext tracks generic semantic drift (F1=0.84) but collapses to F1=0.28 on unseen attack families.\\n\\n**Gap**: What representation properties enable cross-attack generalization? Vanilla encoders fail catastrophically on unseen attacks. LLM-as-judge approaches (GPT-5.5 F1=0.19-0.45) cannot detect process-level manipulation. No published work systematically decomposes what makes the OOD gap bridgeable.\\n\\n**Our angle**: We systematically investigate what enables cross-attack jailbreak detection through a comprehensive ablation study. Starting with the hypothesis that persuasion-specific classification drives generalization, we progressively strip components: label quality (scrambled → same), label granularity (binary → same), temporal modeling (mean pooling → same), loss weighting (all lambda → same). The critical control: MLM continued pretraining without any classification labels also achieves F1=1.0 on unseen attacks. This pinpoints domain exposure (not task-specific supervision) as the mechanism. The persuasion taxonomy provides interpretability but not detection advantage.\\n\\n**Headline result**: \\\"Vanilla semantic modeling collapses on unseen multi-turn attack types (F1=0.28 on Deceptive Delight). We expected persuasion-specific classification to be the key ingredient, but systematic ablation reveals a simpler mechanism: domain-adaptive continued pretraining on jailbreak conversation text (even MLM) bridges the entire +72pp OOD gap. However, persuasion classification provides complementary benefits: cross-seed stability (std reduced 4-20x vs MLM) and interpretability via strategy trajectories. DA's detection advantage also survives adversarial perturbation (McNemar p<0.001), though absolute perturbation robustness is attack-family-dependent (DD: Δ≈0; ActorAttack: all variants degrade).\\\"\\n\\n## Architecture\\n\\n1. **Stage 1**: DeBERTa-v3-base fine-tuned on multi-task objective: 9-class persuasion strategy classification (8 strategies + none) + binary jailbreak-intent classification. Loss: L = L_strategy + 0.3 × L_intent\\n2. **Stage 2**: BiGRU over DeBERTa [CLS] embeddings → binary classifier for conversation-level jailbreak detection\\n3. **Baseline**: Same pipeline but with vanilla (not fine-tuned) DeBERTa embeddings\\nNote: All main results use BiGRU. Ablation (plan_015) shows mean pooling ≈ GRU on both IID and OOD, confirming temporal modeling is unnecessary. This is an ablation finding, not a design choice — GRU remains default for consistency with all reported experiments. Stage-1 training: 4 epochs, best checkpoint selected by validation.\\n\\n## Venue Fit Risks\\n- EMNLP 2026 LLM Security track: strong fit (dedicated track, high visibility)\\n- Discourse/Pragmatics reviewers may want more linguistic rigor: ground taxonomy in PAP (ACL 2024), Hagendorff (Nature Comm 2026), Cialdini principles, Speech Act Theory (Austin 1962, Searle 1969)\\n- Safety reviewers expect multiple attack types: need >= 2 attack families\\n\\n## Anticipated Reviewer Concerns\\n\\n### RC1: Lexical Shortcut (CRITICAL, must address pre-submission)\\nTF-IDF=1.0 IID and 0.94 OOD on DD. Lexical features are inherently strong for this task (D009). DisPeD cannot claim superiority over TF-IDF on raw detection performance alone.\\n- Mitigation (resolved, D009+D012): (a) acknowledge inherent lexical separability honestly; (b) DisPeD's primary value vs TF-IDF is interpretability (strategy trajectories, Claim 2) and bridging the vanilla temporal modeling gap (+72pp on DD); (c) plan_004 adversarial perturbation confirmed: Treatment 0pp degradation vs TF-IDF -1.3pp(K≥3) to -9.6pp(K=1) vs Baseline -12pp. Strongest differentiation at early detection K=1-2; (d) the core comparison that motivates DisPeD is vs vanilla DeBERTa+GRU (DeepContext approach, F1=0.28 on DD), not vs TF-IDF; (e) persuasion fine-tuning as supervision signal is the contribution, not beating a bag-of-words. ✅ RESOLVED\\n\\n### RC2: Small Dataset\\n480 samples is small for a detection paper.\\n- Mitigation: (a) statistical significance via bootstrap CI or paired tests; (b) cross-validation; (c) focus narrative on proof-of-concept for the principle, not SOTA numbers\\n\\n### RC3: Single Attack Type (Crescendo Only)\\nNeed generalization evidence.\\n- Mitigation: generate FITD-style and Deceptive Delight-style conversations using existing pipeline\\n\\n### RC4: Strategy Label Quality (D010)\\nScrambled-label control (D010) shows correct strategy labels contribute only 1-6pp to cross-attack F1. This is not a confound but a finding: the persuasion multi-task objective works as a supervision signal even with imperfect labels. The 9-class taxonomy's primary value is interpretability (Claim 2), not detection.\\n- Mitigation: report scrambled control results transparently; position taxonomy as practical training objective with interpretability bonus\\n\\n### RC5: No Production/LLM-as-Judge Baseline (Dream-surfaced)\\nWithout comparing against zero-shot LLM-based detection (e.g., GPT-4/Claude prompted for conversation-level jailbreak detection), practical positioning is unknown.\\n- Result: GPT-5.5 (frontier LLM) achieves F1=0.19-0.45 on Crescendo (precision=1.0, recall=0.11-0.29). Qwen3-8B F1=0.0-0.15. Both far below Treatment F1=1.0. GPT-5.5 is deceived by Crescendo's \\\"surface educational framing,\\\" confirming that content-level analysis cannot detect persuasion dynamics. Unparseable rate 30-47% (increases with conversation length); paper must report this and provide unparseable-excluded upper bound. Even assuming best-case unparseable correction, LLM judge F1 ≈ 0.7-0.8, still far below Treatment=1.0. ✅ RESOLVED\\n\\n### RC6: Interpretability Claims Without Human Eval\\nStrategy sequence outputs claimed interpretable but not evaluated.\\n- Mitigation: strategy transition matrix visualization + predicted-label trajectory analysis\\n\\n### RC7: Related Work Inadequate (Dream-surfaced, THREE-TIER CONSISTENT)\\n~12 citations is far below venue norms (30-50). Missing coverage of: production safety systems (Llama Guard, WildGuard, ShieldGemma), LLM-as-judge, discourse analysis (RST, PDTB, dialogue acts), computational persuasion (Habernal & Gurevych 2016, Tan et al. 2016), red-teaming (HarmBench, Perez et al. 2022), annotation artifacts (Gururangan et al. 2018), adaptive attacks.\\n- Mitigation: expand to 30+ citations covering all missing categories (Paper Agent task)\\n\\n### RC8: Incremental Novelty Over Prior Work (Dream-surfaced, TWO-TIER)\\nPragmatic Evasion Asymmetry is a natural corollary of Zeng+Hagendorff+HowDoLLMs. Paper should position as \\\"operationalizing known observations\\\" not \\\"identifying a new phenomenon.\\\"\\n- Mitigation: reframe contribution as operationalization + empirical validation (done in novelty positioning above)\\n\\n### RC9: Multi-seed and Statistical Rigor (Dream-surfaced, THREE-TIER)\\nn=72 test set with single seed is inadequate.\\n- Result: 3-seed completed. Treatment F1=1.00±0.00 (zero variance), Baseline K=1 0.968±0.033. ✅ RESOLVED\\n\\n### RC10: \\\"None\\\"-Collapse Ablation (Dream-surfaced, TWO-TIER)\\nModel may reduce to persuasion-presence detector rather than trajectory detector.\\n- Result: Confirmed (D013/D014). Binary≈9-class on DD (1-2pp gap). Mean pooling≈GRU. Model IS a persuasion-presence detector, not a trajectory detector. Paper acknowledges this honestly; 8-class value is interpretability only. ✅ RESOLVED (acknowledged)\\n\\n### RC11: Lambda and Architecture Ablation (Dream-surfaced, TWO-TIER)\\nLambda and architecture choices not ablated.\\n- Result: Lambda∈{0,0.3,0.5,2.0} all F1=1.0 (insensitive). Mean pooling≈GRU on IID and DD. Method robust to all hyperparameter/architecture choices. ✅ RESOLVED\\n\\n## Domain-Adaptive Control Experiments (D018-D020)\\n\\n### plan_016: Sentiment Control — FAILED (M010: label leakage)\\n- Sentiment labels perfectly correlated with jailbreak labels (all jailbreak→negative, benign→positive/neutral)\\n- Experiment invalid, abandoned\\n\\n### plan_016v2: Topic Classification Control — DD OOD F1=0.541±0.207 (D020, 3-seed)\\n- 5-class topic classification (no intent head) on same jailbreak training text\\n- Cramer's V = 0.228, no label leakage\\n- 3-seed results: seed42=0.727, seed123=0.252, seed456=0.644. Mean=0.541±0.207\\n- Seed 123 (0.252) BELOW vanilla (0.284) — misaligned supervision can actively hurt\\n- IID stable: 0.974±0.022 — problem is purely OOD generalization instability\\n- Interpretation: misaligned classification yields unstable OOD generalization; some seeds worse than no training at all. Domain exposure without task interference (MLM=1.0) is strictly superior.\\n\\n### plan_017: MLM Continued Pretraining Control — DD OOD F1≈1.0 (D019, 3-seed)\\n- Pure MLM (15% masking, no classification heads) on same jailbreak training text\\n- 3-seed DD OOD: K1=0.973±0.019, K2=0.993±0.009, K3=0.997±0.005, K5=0.997±0.005, Full=0.914±0.115\\n- Full instability from seed=456 GRU recall=0.64 (classifier-level, not embedding-level)\\n- vs Persuasion 3-seed: Full=0.997±0.005 (s42=1.0, s123=1.0, s456=0.990), K1=0.990±0.013, K2=0.981±0.013, K3=0.972±0.026, K5=0.997±0.005 — persuasion provides near-perfect stability (std 20x smaller than MLM)\\n- DECISIVE for detection: domain exposure alone achieves near-perfect detection (K≤5). Persuasion adds stability at full conversation + perturbation robustness + interpretability.\\n\\n### plan_018: Wikipedia MLM Control — DD OOD Full=0.904±0.115 (D022→D023, 3-seed)\\n- MLM on out-of-domain text (Wikipedia), same volume, same hyperparameters as plan_017\\n- Single seed (42): F1=0.742 — outlier due to GRU instability\\n- 3-seed: Full=0.904±0.115, K2=0.911±0.073 (other seeds 0.98+)\\n- vs Jailbreak MLM 3-seed: Full=0.914±0.115 (1pp gap, not significant), K2=0.993±0.009 (8pp gap)\\n- D023 CORRECTION: domain specificity NOT confirmed at full conversation (1pp gap in noise). Early detection (K≤5) shows ~6-8pp advantage for jailbreak-domain text.\\n- The real differentiator is persuasion classification (0.997±0.005) vs all MLM variants (~0.91±0.11 at full).\\n\\n### Complete Control Decomposition (D019-D030, updated with ActorAttack)\\n\\n| Variant | DD OOD Full | ActorAttack Full | Pert Δ (IID) | Pert Δ (DD OOD) | Pert Δ (ActorAttack) |\\n|---------|-------------|-----------------|-------------|----------------|---------------------|\\n| Vanilla DeBERTa | 0.312±0.026 | 0.258±0.000 | -0.118 | -0.068 (K1) | -0.116 |\\n| Wiki MLM | 0.904±0.115 | 0.686±0.297 | -0.121 | -0.033 | n/a |\\n| Topic classification | 0.541±0.207 | 0.625±0.141 | -0.040 | n/a | n/a |\\n| TF-IDF | 0.944 | n/a | -0.013 to -0.096 | n/a | n/a |\\n| Scrambled labels | 0.997±0.005 | 0.951±0.043 | 0.000 (Full) | +0.003 | **-0.172** |\\n| Binary persuasion | 0.997±0.005 | 0.990±0.008 | 0.000 (Full) | +0.003 | **-0.353** |\\n| JB MLM | 0.914±0.115 | 0.893±0.080 | -0.026 | +0.027 | **-0.353** |\\n| **9-class** | **0.997±0.005** | **0.972±0.026** | **0.000** | **+0.003** | **-0.204±0.135** |\\n| RoBERTa vanilla | 0.981±0.026 | 0.466±0.163 | n/a | n/a | n/a |\\n| RoBERTa MLM | 0.987±0.018 | 0.730±0.201 | n/a | n/a | n/a |\\n| RoBERTa 9-class | 0.994±0.005 | 0.939±0.046 | n/a | n/a | n/a |\\n\\n**ActorAttack perturbation key finding (exp6)**: DD OOD Δ≈0 for all classification variants, but ActorAttack Δ=-0.17 to -0.35. Robustness hierarchy reverses: scrambled (-0.172) < 9-class (-0.204) < binary (-0.353). 9-class has extreme seed variance (std=0.135: seed123=-0.013, seed42=-0.296, seed456=-0.303). Despite degradation, DA models retain large advantage over vanilla under perturbation (9-class perturbed=0.768 >> vanilla=0.248, McNemar p<0.001).\\n\\n**Key pattern across DD vs ActorAttack (D030)**:\\n- DD (moderate OOD): scrambled ≈ binary ≈ 9-class → label quality irrelevant (ceiling effect)\\n- ActorAttack (hard OOD): binary (0.990±0.008) ≈ 9-class (0.972±0.026) ≈ scrambled (0.951±0.043) → all equivalent, max gap 3.9pp within noise at n=3 (D032). Consistent with DD: label quality is not a detection factor at any OOD difficulty\\n- RoBERTa vanilla: DD=0.981 (no DA needed) vs ActorAttack=0.466 (DA critical) → \\\"no DA needed\\\" was attack-specific\\n- DeBERTa 9-class (0.972) > RoBERTa 9-class (0.939) on ActorAttack → more extensive DA produces more robust representations\\n\\n**Four-layer value structure (D021-D026)**:\\n1. **Detection**: Continued pretraining (any domain) bridges most of OOD gap (0.28→0.91). Domain-specific text helps early detection (K=1-5: 6-8pp gap) but not Full (1pp).\\n2. **Stability**: Classification supervision provides seed stability: 9-class 0.997±0.005 (std 20x smaller) vs JB MLM 0.914±0.115 vs wiki MLM 0.904±0.115.\\n3. **Cross-seed Stability (Claim 3)**: Classification supervision reduces variance 4-20x vs MLM. 9-class std=0.005 (DD) / 0.026 (ActorAttack) vs JB-MLM std=0.115 / 0.080. Consistent across both OOD families.\\n   - **Perturbation (Discussion finding, not Claim)**: DD OOD Δ≈0 for classification variants; ActorAttack ALL degrade (Δ=-0.17 to -0.35).

A Systematic Decomposition of Cross-Attack Generalization\\\\n\\\\n## Core Insight (D030 — post-ActorAttack universal DA reframe)\\\\nDomain adaptation universally improves cross-attack generalization across encoder architectures; encoder pretraining determines the difficulty threshold at which adaptation becomes critical. Systematic ablation across two encoders (DeBERTa-v3, RoBERTa) and three OOD attack families (DD, FITD, ActorAttack) reveals:\\\\n\\\\n**On Deceptive Delight (moderate OOD)**: DeBERTa vanilla collapses (F1=0.31±0.03), continued pretraining bridges ~60pp (MLM=0.91±0.12), classification achieves 0.997±0.005. RoBERTa vanilla already succeeds (0.981±0.026) — hierarchy is flat. Scrambled=binary=9-class (all 0.997±0.005).\\\\n\\\\n**On ActorAttack (hard OOD)**: RoBERTa vanilla ALSO collapses (0.466±0.163), proving \\\\\\\"no DA needed\\\\\\\" was DD-specific. DeBERTa vanilla=0.258±0.000. Both encoders benefit from DA: DeBERTa 9-class=0.972±0.026, RoBERTa 9-class=0.939±0.046. Binary (0.990±0.008) ≈ 9-class (0.972±0.026) ≈ scrambled (0.951±0.043) — all three classification variants equivalent at Full (max gap 3.9pp, variance intervals fully overlap, n=3). Label quality is not a significant factor on ActorAttack, consistent with DD findings (D032).\\\\n\\\\n**Cross-encoder CKA (D029)**: Both MLM and 9-class reshape representations substantially (centered CKA < 0.5 vs vanilla), but representation change magnitude ≠ detection improvement. RoBERTa MLM changes more (CKA=0.393) yet gains only 0.6pp; DeBERTa MLM changes less (CKA=0.442) yet gains 60pp. The starting point determines the return on adaptation.\\\\n\\\\n**Key nuances**: (1) Binary ≈ 9-class ≈ scrambled on ActorAttack Full (0.990 vs 0.972 vs 0.951, all within noise at n=3; D032). Label quality is not a detection-relevant factor on any OOD difficulty. (2) Classification supervision consistently reduces cross-seed variance 4-20x (Claim 3): 9-class std=0.005-0.026 vs MLM std=0.080-0.115, across both DD and ActorAttack. (3) Perturbation robustness is attack-family-dependent (Discussion finding): DD OOD Δ≈0, ActorAttack Δ=-0.17 to -0.35 for ALL variants. DA detection advantage survives perturbation (McNemar p<0.001) as Claim 1 corollary.\\\\n\\\\n## Novelty Positioning (D030 reframe)\\\\nNOT: \\\\\\\"Persuasion-aware fine-tuning is the critical ingredient\\\\\\\" (MLM control falsified this on DD).\\\\nNOT: \\\\\\\"RoBERTa doesn't need domain adaptation\\\\\\\" (ActorAttack falsified this — D030).\\\\nNOT: \\\\\\\"Label quality matters on hard attacks\\\\\\\" (3-seed ActorAttack: binary 0.990 ≈ 9-class 0.972 ≈ scrambled 0.951, all within noise; D032).\\\\nNOT: \\\\\\\"Perturbation robustness generalizes across attack families\\\\\\\" (exp6 falsified: DD Δ≈0 but ActorAttack Δ=-0.17 to -0.35 for all variants).\\\\nYES: \\\\\\\"We systematically decompose cross-attack generalization across two encoder architectures and three OOD attack families. The key finding: domain adaptation universally improves generalization, but the benefit depends on encoder pretraining × attack structural complexity. On moderate OOD (DD), RoBERTa succeeds without adaptation while DeBERTa requires it; on structurally complex attacks (ActorAttack), both encoders require adaptation. Classification supervision provides complementary benefits: cross-seed stability (std reduced 4-20x vs MLM, consistent across DD and ActorAttack) and interpretability via strategy trajectories. DA's detection advantage survives adversarial perturbation (McNemar p<0.001), though absolute perturbation robustness is attack-family-dependent. Label quality (correct vs scrambled vs binary) does not significantly affect detection at any OOD difficulty level (D032).\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n## Inherent Lexical Separability (D009)\\\\nPersuasive jailbreak conversations and general benign conversations are inherently lexically separable (TF-IDF≈1.0 on ALL data sources including real WildChat). TF-IDF remains strong even OOD (F1=0.94 on DD). The paper acknowledges this and positions DisPeD's value as: (1) bridging the vanilla temporal modeling gap (+72pp on DD), (2) cross-seed stability (std 4-20x smaller than MLM variants), (3) interpretability via strategy trajectories.\\\\n\\\\n## Comprehensive Ablation Picture (D014, updated D019/D020)\\\\nSystematic ablation reveals the method's actual mechanism:\\\\n- **Critical**: Domain exposure on jailbreak text (any form: MLM, scrambled, persuasion) — bridges OOD gap from F1=0.28 to F1≈1.0\\\\n- **Harmful**: Misaligned classification objective (topic: F1=0.54±0.21, -37pp vs MLM) — constrains representations toward irrelevant features\\\\n- **Non-critical**: Label granularity (binary≈scrambled≈9-class, 1-6pp gap on DD), Lambda tuning (all F1=1.0), Temporal modeling (mean pooling≈GRU on DD), Classification supervision itself (MLM Full=0.91±0.12 without any labels, K≤5 ≥0.97)\\\\n- **Implication**: Domain exposure is the mechanism. Classification supervision is neither necessary nor sufficient — misaligned tasks hurt, aligned/random tasks don't help beyond MLM. 9-class taxonomy provides interpretability, not detection advantage.\\\\n\\\\n## Core Claims (3, priority-ordered — D019 reframe, D034 Claim 3 restructure)\\\\n\\\\n### Claim 1 (PRIMARY): Domain Exposure Bridges the Cross-Attack OOD Gap\\\\nVanilla DeBERTa catastrophically fails on unseen attack types (F1=0.28 on DD). Domain-adaptive continued pretraining on jailbreak conversation text bridges this gap completely (F1=1.0, +72pp). The critical finding: even MLM without any classification labels achieves F1=1.0 on DD (plan_017), proving that domain exposure alone is sufficient. Misaligned classification (topic, plan_016v2) achieves only F1=0.73, showing that irrelevant task objectives constrain representations harmfully. Complete evidence hierarchy (DD Full F1, multi-seed): vanilla (0.28) < topic (0.54±0.21) < wiki-MLM (0.90±0.12) ≈ JB-MLM (0.91±0.12) < TF-IDF (0.94) < scrambled (0.99) ≈ binary (0.99) ≪ 9-class (1.00±0.005).\\\\n- Evidence: plan_017 MLM DD — 3-seed Full=0.914±0.115, K≤5 ≥0.97 (no classification labels)\\\\n- Evidence: plan_018 wiki-MLM DD — 3-seed Full=0.904±0.115, ≈ JB-MLM (domain specificity not significant at Full)\\\\n- Evidence: plan_016v2 topic DD — 3-seed 0.541±0.207 (misaligned classification hurts vs MLM)\\\\n- Evidence: plan_006 DD — Treatment F1=1.0, Baseline=0.28 (+72pp)\\\\n- Evidence: plan_006 scrambled DD — F1=0.935-0.990 (labels non-essential)\\\\n- Evidence: plan_013 binary DD — F1=0.99 (label granularity non-essential)\\\\n- Evidence: exp6 perturbation — DA detection advantage survives adversarial perturbation (9-class perturbed ActorAttack=0.768 >> vanilla=0.248, McNemar p<0.001). Domain adaptation's generalization benefit is not erased by paraphrasing attacks.\\\\n- Strength: very strong — MLM control is the definitive causal test; topic control adds nuance; perturbation survival confirms robustness of DA benefit\\\\n\\\\n### Claim 2 (ANALYSIS): Persuasion Taxonomy as Interpretability Layer\\\\nWhile the persuasion classification task does not contribute to detection performance, the 9-class taxonomy provides interpretability that MLM cannot: different attack types exhibit distinct strategy trajectories (Crescendo: gradual escalation 0.86→5.64, DD: emotional-manipulation→role-assignment, FITD: commitment patterns). This is the taxonomy's sole surviving value after the MLM control result.\\\\n- Evidence: plan_008 strategy transition matrices\\\\n- Evidence: plan_017 falsifies detection contribution, confirming interpretability-only role\\\\n- Strength: descriptive/analytical; interpretability value independent of detection mechanism\\\\n\\\\n### Claim 3 (EMPIRICAL): Classification Supervision Provides Cross-Seed Stability\\\\nClassification supervision reduces cross-seed variance by 4-20x compared to MLM-only pretraining, across BOTH OOD attack families. 9-class std=0.005 (DD) / 0.026 (ActorAttack) vs JB-MLM std=0.115 (DD) / 0.080 (ActorAttack). Binary and scrambled variants also achieve low variance (0.005-0.043). This holds universally — no attack-family dependence, unlike perturbation robustness.\\\\n- Evidence: 9-class DD 0.997±0.005 vs JB-MLM 0.914±0.115 (std 23x smaller)\\\\n- Evidence: 9-class ActorAttack 0.972±0.026 vs JB-MLM 0.893±0.080 (std 3x smaller)\\\\n- Evidence: wiki-MLM 0.904±0.115 — out-of-domain MLM equally unstable\\\\n- Implication: Classification supervision (even with scrambled labels) stabilizes GRU-level downstream performance. Deployment significance: high seed stability = predictable model behavior across random initializations.\\\\n- Strength: strong — consistent across 2 OOD families, 7 encoder variants, 3 seeds each\\\\n\\\\n### Perturbation Robustness (DISCUSSION FINDING — demoted from Claim, D033/D034)\\\\nAdversarial perturbation robustness does NOT generalize across attack families. On DD OOD, classification variants show near-zero degradation (Δ≈0 at K≥2). On ActorAttack, ALL variants degrade substantially: 9-class Δ_full=-0.204±0.135, binary -0.353, scrambled -0.172, MLM -0.353, vanilla -0.116.\\\\n- DD robustness attribution (D026, holds on DD only): classification structure → Full/K≥3 Δ=0; correct+fine-grained → K=2 Δ=0; both contribute at K=1.\\\\n- ActorAttack: three-layer attribution does NOT hold. Hierarchy reverses (scrambled -0.172 < 9-class -0.204 < binary -0.353).\\\\n- DA detection advantage persists under perturbation (9-class perturbed=0.768 >> vanilla=0.248, McNemar p<0.001) — this is a corollary of Claim 1, not an independent robustness claim.\\\\n- 9-class ActorAttack perturbation has extreme seed variance: seed123=-0.013, seed42=-0.296, seed456=-0.303 (std=0.135).\\\\n- **Limitation**: Absolute perturbation robustness (Δ≈0) only verified on DD OOD. ActorAttack shows all variants degrade. Mechanism hypothesis (distributed multi-turn signals more vulnerable to paraphrasing than concentrated attacks) is post-hoc and unverified — future work.\\\\n- Caveat (Reviewer #53): DD perturbation n=76, small sample.\\\\n\\\\n## Story Spine (D019 reframe)\\\\n\\\\n**Problem**: Multi-turn jailbreak attacks distribute adversarial intent across individually benign turns. Bullwinkel et al. (2025) show per-turn representations are deliberately kept in a \\\\\\\"benign\\\\\\\" region. DeepContext tracks generic semantic drift (F1=0.84) but collapses to F1=0.28 on unseen attack families.\\\\n\\\\n**Gap**: What representation properties enable cross-attack generalization? Vanilla encoders fail catastrophically on unseen attacks. LLM-as-judge approaches (GPT-5.5 F1=0.19-0.45) cannot detect process-level manipulation. No published work systematically decomposes what makes the OOD gap bridgeable.\\\\n\\\\n**Our angle**: We systematically investigate what enables cross-attack jailbreak detection through a comprehensive ablation study. Starting with the hypothesis that persuasion-specific classification drives generalization, we progressively strip components: label quality (scrambled → same), label granularity (binary → same), temporal modeling (mean pooling → same), loss weighting (all lambda → same). The critical control: MLM continued pretraining without any classification labels also achieves F1=1.0 on unseen attacks. This pinpoints domain exposure (not task-specific supervision) as the mechanism. The persuasion taxonomy provides interpretability but not detection advantage.\\\\n\\\\n**Headline result**: \\\\\\\"Vanilla semantic modeling collapses on unseen multi-turn attack types (F1=0.28 on Deceptive Delight). We expected persuasion-specific classification to be the key ingredient, but systematic ablation reveals a simpler mechanism: domain-adaptive continued pretraining on jailbreak conversation text (even MLM) bridges the entire +72pp OOD gap. However, persuasion classification provides complementary benefits: cross-seed stability (std reduced 4-20x vs MLM) and interpretability via strategy trajectories. DA's detection advantage also survives adversarial perturbation (McNemar p<0.001), though absolute perturbation robustness is attack-family-dependent (DD: Δ≈0; ActorAttack: all variants degrade).\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n## Architecture\\\\n\\\\n1. **Stage 1**: DeBERTa-v3-base fine-tuned on multi-task objective: 9-class persuasion strategy classification (8 strategies + none) + binary jailbreak-intent classification. Loss: L = L_strategy + 0.3 × L_intent\\\\n2. **Stage 2**: BiGRU over DeBERTa [CLS] embeddings → binary classifier for conversation-level jailbreak detection\\\\n3. **Baseline**: Same pipeline but with vanilla (not fine-tuned) DeBERTa embeddings\\\\nNote: All main results use BiGRU. Ablation (plan_015) shows mean pooling ≈ GRU on both IID and OOD, confirming temporal modeling is unnecessary. This is an ablation finding, not a design choice — GRU remains default for consistency with all reported experiments. Stage-1 training: 4 epochs, best checkpoint selected by validation.\\\\n\\\\n## Venue Fit Risks\\\\n- EMNLP 2026 LLM Security track: strong fit (dedicated track, high visibility)\\\\n- Discourse/Pragmatics reviewers may want more linguistic rigor: ground taxonomy in PAP (ACL 2024), Hagendorff (Nature Comm 2026), Cialdini principles, Speech Act Theory (Austin 1962, Searle 1969)\\\\n- Safety reviewers expect multiple attack types: need >= 2 attack families\\\\n\\\\n## Anticipated Reviewer Concerns\\\\n\\\\n### RC1: Lexical Shortcut (CRITICAL, must address pre-submission)\\\\nTF-IDF=1.0 IID and 0.94 OOD on DD. Lexical features are inherently strong for this task (D009). DisPeD cannot claim superiority over TF-IDF on raw detection performance alone.\\\\n- Mitigation (resolved, D009+D012): (a) acknowledge inherent lexical separability honestly; (b) DisPeD's primary value vs TF-IDF is interpretability (strategy trajectories, Claim 2) and bridging the vanilla temporal modeling gap (+72pp on DD); (c) plan_004 adversarial perturbation confirmed: Treatment 0pp degradation vs TF-IDF -1.3pp(K≥3) to -9.6pp(K=1) vs Baseline -12pp. Strongest differentiation at early detection K=1-2; (d) the core comparison that motivates DisPeD is vs vanilla DeBERTa+GRU (DeepContext approach, F1=0.28 on DD), not vs TF-IDF; (e) persuasion fine-tuning as supervision signal is the contribution, not beating a bag-of-words. ✅ RESOLVED\\\\n\\\\n### RC2: Small Dataset\\\\n480 samples is small for a detection paper.\\\\n- Mitigation: (a) statistical significance via bootstrap CI or paired tests; (b) cross-validation; (c) focus narrative on proof-of-concept for the principle, not SOTA numbers\\\\n\\\\n### RC3: Single Attack Type (Crescendo Only)\\\\nNeed generalization evidence.\\\\n- Mitigation: generate FITD-style and Deceptive Delight-style conversations using existing pipeline\\\\n\\\\n### RC4: Strategy Label Quality (D010)\\\\nScrambled-label control (D010) shows correct strategy labels contribute only 1-6pp to cross-attack F1. This is not a confound but a finding: the persuasion multi-task objective works as a supervision signal even with imperfect labels. The 9-class taxonomy's primary value is interpretability (Claim 2), not detection.\\\\n- Mitigation: report scrambled control results transparently; position taxonomy as practical training objective with interpretability bonus\\\\n\\\\n### RC5: No Production/LLM-as-Judge Baseline (Dream-surfaced)\\\\nWithout comparing against zero-shot LLM-based detection (e.g., GPT-4/Claude prompted for conversation-level jailbreak detection), practical positioning is unknown.\\\\n- Result: GPT-5.5 (frontier LLM) achieves F1=0.19-0.45 on Crescendo (precision=1.0, recall=0.11-0.29). Qwen3-8B F1=0.0-0.15. Both far below Treatment F1=1.0. GPT-5.5 is deceived by Crescendo's \\\\\\\"surface educational framing,\\\\\\\" confirming that content-level analysis cannot detect persuasion dynamics. Unparseable rate 30-47% (increases with conversation length); paper must report this and provide unparseable-excluded upper bound. Even assuming best-case unparseable correction, LLM judge F1 ≈ 0.7-0.8, still far below Treatment=1.0. ✅ RESOLVED\\\\n\\\\n### RC6: Interpretability Claims Without Human Eval\\\\nStrategy sequence outputs claimed interpretable but not evaluated.\\\\n- Mitigation: strategy transition matrix visualization + predicted-label trajectory analysis\\\\n\\\\n### RC7: Related Work Inadequate (Dream-surfaced, THREE-TIER CONSISTENT)\\\\n~12 citations is far below venue norms (30-50).

A Systematic Decomposition of Cross-Attack Generalization\\n\\n## Core Insight (D030 — post-ActorAttack universal DA reframe)\\nDomain adaptation universally improves cross-attack generalization across encoder architectures; encoder pretraining determines the difficulty threshold at which adaptation becomes critical. Systematic ablation across two encoders (DeBERTa-v3, RoBERTa) and three OOD attack families (DD, FITD, ActorAttack) reveals:\\n\\n**On Deceptive Delight (moderate OOD)**: DeBERTa vanilla collapses (F1=0.31±0.03), continued pretraining bridges ~60pp (MLM=0.91±0.12), classification achieves 0.997±0.005. RoBERTa vanilla already succeeds (0.981±0.026) — hierarchy is flat. Scrambled=binary=9-class (all 0.997±0.005).\\n\\n**On ActorAttack (hard OOD)**: RoBERTa vanilla ALSO collapses (0.466±0.163), proving \\\"no DA needed\\\" was DD-specific. DeBERTa vanilla=0.258±0.000. Both encoders benefit from DA: DeBERTa 9-class=0.972±0.026, RoBERTa 9-class=0.939±0.046. Binary (0.990±0.008) ≈ 9-class (0.972±0.026) ≈ scrambled (0.951±0.043) — all three classification variants equivalent at Full (max gap 3.9pp, variance intervals fully overlap, n=3). Label quality is not a significant factor on ActorAttack, consistent with DD findings (D032).\\n\\n**Cross-encoder CKA (D029)**: Both MLM and 9-class reshape representations substantially (centered CKA < 0.5 vs vanilla), but representation change magnitude ≠ detection improvement. RoBERTa MLM changes more (CKA=0.393) yet gains only 0.6pp; DeBERTa MLM changes less (CKA=0.442) yet gains 60pp. The starting point determines the return on adaptation.\\n\\n**Key nuances**: (1) Binary ≈ 9-class ≈ scrambled on ActorAttack Full (0.990 vs 0.972 vs 0.951, all within noise at n=3; D032). Label quality is not a detection-relevant factor on any OOD difficulty. (2) Classification supervision consistently reduces cross-seed variance 4-20x (Claim 3): 9-class std=0.005-0.026 vs MLM std=0.080-0.115, across both DD and ActorAttack. (3) Perturbation robustness is attack-family-dependent (Discussion finding): DD OOD Δ≈0, ActorAttack Δ=-0.17 to -0.35 for ALL variants. DA detection advantage survives perturbation (McNemar p<0.001) as Claim 1 corollary.\\n\\n## Novelty Positioning (D030 reframe)\\nNOT: \\\"Persuasion-aware fine-tuning is the critical ingredient\\\" (MLM control falsified this on DD).\\nNOT: \\\"RoBERTa doesn't need domain adaptation\\\" (ActorAttack falsified this — D030).\\nNOT: \\\"Label quality matters on hard attacks\\\" (3-seed ActorAttack: binary 0.990 ≈ 9-class 0.972 ≈ scrambled 0.951, all within noise; D032).\\nNOT: \\\"Perturbation robustness generalizes across attack families\\\" (exp6 falsified: DD Δ≈0 but ActorAttack Δ=-0.17 to -0.35 for all variants).\\nYES: \\\"We systematically decompose cross-attack generalization across two encoder architectures and three OOD attack families. The key finding: domain adaptation universally improves generalization, but the benefit depends on encoder pretraining × attack structural complexity. On moderate OOD (DD), RoBERTa succeeds without adaptation while DeBERTa requires it; on structurally complex attacks (ActorAttack), both encoders require adaptation. Classification supervision provides complementary benefits: cross-seed stability (std reduced 4-20x vs MLM, consistent across DD and ActorAttack) and interpretability via strategy trajectories. DA's detection advantage survives adversarial perturbation (McNemar p<0.001), though absolute perturbation robustness is attack-family-dependent. Label quality (correct vs scrambled vs binary) does not significantly affect detection at any OOD difficulty level (D032).\\\"\\n\\n## Inherent Lexical Separability (D009)\\nPersuasive jailbreak conversations and general benign conversations are inherently lexically separable (TF-IDF≈1.0 on ALL data sources including real WildChat). TF-IDF remains strong even OOD (F1=0.94 on DD). The paper acknowledges this and positions DisPeD's value as: (1) bridging the vanilla temporal modeling gap (+72pp on DD), (2) cross-seed stability (std 4-20x smaller than MLM variants), (3) interpretability via strategy trajectories.\\n\\n## Comprehensive Ablation Picture (D014, updated D019/D020)\\nSystematic ablation reveals the method's actual mechanism:\\n- **Critical**: Domain exposure on jailbreak text (any form: MLM, scrambled, persuasion) — bridges OOD gap from F1=0.28 to F1≈1.0\\n- **Harmful**: Misaligned classification objective (topic: F1=0.54±0.21, -37pp vs MLM) — constrains representations toward irrelevant features\\n- **Non-critical**: Label granularity (binary≈scrambled≈9-class, 1-6pp gap on DD), Lambda tuning (all F1=1.0), Temporal modeling (mean pooling≈GRU on DD), Classification supervision itself (MLM Full=0.91±0.12 without any labels, K≤5 ≥0.97)\\n- **Implication**: Domain exposure is the mechanism. Classification supervision is neither necessary nor sufficient — misaligned tasks hurt, aligned/random tasks don't help beyond MLM. 9-class taxonomy provides interpretability, not detection advantage.\\n\\n## Core Claims (3, priority-ordered — D019 reframe, D034 Claim 3 restructure)\\n\\n### Claim 1 (PRIMARY): Domain Exposure Bridges the Cross-Attack OOD Gap\\nVanilla DeBERTa catastrophically fails on unseen attack types (F1=0.28 on DD). Domain-adaptive continued pretraining on jailbreak conversation text bridges this gap completely (F1=1.0, +72pp). The critical finding: even MLM without any classification labels achieves F1=1.0 on DD (plan_017), proving that domain exposure alone is sufficient. Misaligned classification (topic, plan_016v2) achieves only F1=0.73, showing that irrelevant task objectives constrain representations harmfully. Complete evidence hierarchy (DD Full F1, multi-seed): vanilla (0.28) < topic (0.54±0.21) < wiki-MLM (0.90±0.12) ≈ JB-MLM (0.91±0.12) < TF-IDF (0.94) < scrambled (0.99) ≈ binary (0.99) ≪ 9-class (1.00±0.005).\\n- Evidence: plan_017 MLM DD — 3-seed Full=0.914±0.115, K≤5 ≥0.97 (no classification labels)\\n- Evidence: plan_018 wiki-MLM DD — 3-seed Full=0.904±0.115, ≈ JB-MLM (domain specificity not significant at Full)\\n- Evidence: plan_016v2 topic DD — 3-seed 0.541±0.207 (misaligned classification hurts vs MLM)\\n- Evidence: plan_006 DD — Treatment F1=1.0, Baseline=0.28 (+72pp)\\n- Evidence: plan_006 scrambled DD — F1=0.935-0.990 (labels non-essential)\\n- Evidence: plan_013 binary DD — F1=0.99 (label granularity non-essential)\\n- Evidence: exp6 perturbation — DA detection advantage survives adversarial perturbation (9-class perturbed ActorAttack=0.768 >> vanilla=0.248, McNemar p<0.001). Domain adaptation's generalization benefit is not erased by paraphrasing attacks.\\n- Strength: very strong — MLM control is the definitive causal test; topic control adds nuance; perturbation survival confirms robustness of DA benefit\\n\\n### Claim 2 (ANALYSIS): Persuasion Taxonomy as Interpretability Layer\\nWhile the persuasion classification task does not contribute to detection performance, the 9-class taxonomy provides interpretability that MLM cannot: different attack types exhibit distinct strategy trajectories (Crescendo: gradual escalation 0.86→5.64, DD: emotional-manipulation→role-assignment, FITD: commitment patterns). This is the taxonomy's sole surviving value after the MLM control result.\\n- Evidence: plan_008 strategy transition matrices\\n- Evidence: plan_017 falsifies detection contribution, confirming interpretability-only role\\n- Strength: descriptive/analytical; interpretability value independent of detection mechanism\\n\\n### Claim 3 (EMPIRICAL): Classification Supervision Provides Cross-Seed Stability\\nClassification supervision reduces cross-seed variance by 4-20x compared to MLM-only pretraining, across BOTH OOD attack families. 9-class std=0.005 (DD) / 0.026 (ActorAttack) vs JB-MLM std=0.115 (DD) / 0.080 (ActorAttack). Binary and scrambled variants also achieve low variance (0.005-0.043). This holds universally — no attack-family dependence, unlike perturbation robustness.\\n- Evidence: 9-class DD 0.997±0.005 vs JB-MLM 0.914±0.115 (std 23x smaller)\\n- Evidence: 9-class ActorAttack 0.972±0.026 vs JB-MLM 0.893±0.080 (std 3x smaller)\\n- Evidence: wiki-MLM 0.904±0.115 — out-of-domain MLM equally unstable\\n- Implication: Classification supervision (even with scrambled labels) stabilizes GRU-level downstream performance. Deployment significance: high seed stability = predictable model behavior across random initializations.\\n- Strength: strong — consistent across 2 OOD families, 7 encoder variants, 3 seeds each\\n\\n### Perturbation Robustness (DISCUSSION FINDING — demoted from Claim, D033/D034)\\nAdversarial perturbation robustness does NOT generalize across attack families. On DD OOD, classification variants show near-zero degradation (Δ≈0 at K≥2). On ActorAttack, ALL variants degrade substantially: 9-class Δ_full=-0.204±0.135, binary -0.353, scrambled -0.172, MLM -0.353, vanilla -0.116.\\n- DD robustness attribution (D026, holds on DD only): classification structure → Full/K≥3 Δ=0; correct+fine-grained → K=2 Δ=0; both contribute at K=1.\\n- ActorAttack: three-layer attribution does NOT hold. Hierarchy reverses (scrambled -0.172 < 9-class -0.204 < binary -0.353).\\n- DA detection advantage persists under perturbation (9-class perturbed=0.768 >> vanilla=0.248, McNemar p<0.001) — this is a corollary of Claim 1, not an independent robustness claim.\\n- 9-class ActorAttack perturbation has extreme seed variance: seed123=-0.013, seed42=-0.296, seed456=-0.303 (std=0.135).\\n- **Limitation**: Absolute perturbation robustness (Δ≈0) only verified on DD OOD. ActorAttack shows all variants degrade. Mechanism hypothesis (distributed multi-turn signals more vulnerable to paraphrasing than concentrated attacks) is post-hoc and unverified — future work.\\n- Caveat (Reviewer #53): DD perturbation n=76, small sample.\\n\\n## Story Spine (D019 reframe)\\n\\n**Problem**: Multi-turn jailbreak attacks distribute adversarial intent across individually benign turns. Bullwinkel et al. (2025) show per-turn representations are deliberately kept in a \\\"benign\\\" region. DeepContext tracks generic semantic drift (F1=0.84) but collapses to F1=0.28 on unseen attack families.\\n\\n**Gap**: What representation properties enable cross-attack generalization? Vanilla encoders fail catastrophically on unseen attacks. LLM-as-judge approaches (GPT-5.5 F1=0.19-0.45) cannot detect process-level manipulation. No published work systematically decomposes what makes the OOD gap bridgeable.\\n\\n**Our angle**: We systematically investigate what enables cross-attack jailbreak detection through a comprehensive ablation study. Starting with the hypothesis that persuasion-specific classification drives generalization, we progressively strip components: label quality (scrambled → same), label granularity (binary → same), temporal modeling (mean pooling → same), loss weighting (all lambda → same). The critical control: MLM continued pretraining without any classification labels also achieves F1=1.0 on unseen attacks. This pinpoints domain exposure (not task-specific supervision) as the mechanism. The persuasion taxonomy provides interpretability but not detection advantage.\\n\\n**Headline result**: \\\"Vanilla semantic modeling collapses on unseen multi-turn attack types (F1=0.28 on Deceptive Delight). We expected persuasion-specific classification to be the key ingredient, but systematic ablation reveals a simpler mechanism: domain-adaptive continued pretraining on jailbreak conversation text (even MLM) bridges the entire +72pp OOD gap. However, persuasion classification provides complementary benefits: cross-seed stability (std reduced 4-20x vs MLM) and interpretability via strategy trajectories. DA's detection advantage also survives adversarial perturbation (McNemar p<0.001), though absolute perturbation robustness is attack-family-dependent (DD: Δ≈0; ActorAttack: all variants degrade).\\\"\\n\\n## Architecture\\n\\n1. **Stage 1**: DeBERTa-v3-base fine-tuned on multi-task objective: 9-class persuasion strategy classification (8 strategies + none) + binary jailbreak-intent classification. Loss: L = L_strategy + 0.3 × L_intent\\n2. **Stage 2**: BiGRU over DeBERTa [CLS] embeddings → binary classifier for conversation-level jailbreak detection\\n3. **Baseline**: Same pipeline but with vanilla (not fine-tuned) DeBERTa embeddings\\nNote: All main results use BiGRU. Ablation (plan_015) shows mean pooling ≈ GRU on both IID and OOD, confirming temporal modeling is unnecessary. This is an ablation finding, not a design choice — GRU remains default for consistency with all reported experiments. Stage-1 training: 4 epochs, best checkpoint selected by validation.\\n\\n## Venue Fit Risks\\n- EMNLP 2026 LLM Security track: strong fit (dedicated track, high visibility)\\n- Discourse/Pragmatics reviewers may want more linguistic rigor: ground taxonomy in PAP (ACL 2024), Hagendorff (Nature Comm 2026), Cialdini principles, Speech Act Theory (Austin 1962, Searle 1969)\\n- Safety reviewers expect multiple attack types: need >= 2 attack families\\n\\n## Anticipated Reviewer Concerns\\n\\n### RC1: Lexical Shortcut (CRITICAL, must address pre-submission)\\nTF-IDF=1.0 IID and 0.94 OOD on DD. Lexical features are inherently strong for this task (D009). DisPeD cannot claim superiority over TF-IDF on raw detection performance alone.\\n- Mitigation (resolved, D009+D012): (a) acknowledge inherent lexical separability honestly; (b) DisPeD's primary value vs TF-IDF is interpretability (strategy trajectories, Claim 2) and bridging the vanilla temporal modeling gap (+72pp on DD); (c) plan_004 adversarial perturbation confirmed: Treatment 0pp degradation vs TF-IDF -1.3pp(K≥3) to -9.6pp(K=1) vs Baseline -12pp. Strongest differentiation at early detection K=1-2; (d) the core comparison that motivates DisPeD is vs vanilla DeBERTa+GRU (DeepContext approach, F1=0.28 on DD), not vs TF-IDF; (e) persuasion fine-tuning as supervision signal is the contribution, not beating a bag-of-words. ✅ RESOLVED\\n\\n### RC2: Small Dataset\\n480 samples is small for a detection paper.\\n- Mitigation: (a) statistical significance via bootstrap CI or paired tests; (b) cross-validation; (c) focus narrative on proof-of-concept for the principle, not SOTA numbers\\n\\n### RC3: Single Attack Type (Crescendo Only)\\nNeed generalization evidence.\\n- Mitigation: generate FITD-style and Deceptive Delight-style conversations using existing pipeline\\n\\n### RC4: Strategy Label Quality (D010)\\nScrambled-label control (D010) shows correct strategy labels contribute only 1-6pp to cross-attack F1. This is not a confound but a finding: the persuasion multi-task objective works as a supervision signal even with imperfect labels. The 9-class taxonomy's primary value is interpretability (Claim 2), not detection.\\n- Mitigation: report scrambled control results transparently; position taxonomy as practical training objective with interpretability bonus\\n\\n### RC5: No Production/LLM-as-Judge Baseline (Dream-surfaced)\\nWithout comparing against zero-shot LLM-based detection (e.g., GPT-4/Claude prompted for conversation-level jailbreak detection), practical positioning is unknown.\\n- Result: GPT-5.5 (frontier LLM) achieves F1=0.19-0.45 on Crescendo (precision=1.0, recall=0.11-0.29). Qwen3-8B F1=0.0-0.15. Both far below Treatment F1=1.0. GPT-5.5 is deceived by Crescendo's \\\"surface educational framing,\\\" confirming that content-level analysis cannot detect persuasion dynamics. Unparseable rate 30-47% (increases with conversation length); paper must report this and provide unparseable-excluded upper bound. Even assuming best-case unparseable correction, LLM judge F1 ≈ 0.7-0.8, still far below Treatment=1.0. ✅ RESOLVED\\n\\n### RC6: Interpretability Claims Without Human Eval\\nStrategy sequence outputs claimed interpretable but not evaluated.\\n- Mitigation: strategy transition matrix visualization + predicted-label trajectory analysis\\n\\n### RC7: Related Work Inadequate (Dream-surfaced, THREE-TIER CONSISTENT)\\n~12 citations is far below venue norms (30-50).

214	
215	Table~\ref{tab:perturbation} reveals a three-layer robustness attribution.
216	All classification-supervised variants (9-class, binary, scrambled) achieve zero degradation at full conversation length and $K \geq 3$, regardless of label correctness.
217	Classification training structure alone suffices for full-length robustness.
218	At $K$=2, the combination of correct and fine-grained labels is required: only 9-class ($\Delta$=0.0) maintains zero degradation, while scrambled (random labels, fine-grained) and binary (correct labels, coarse) both degrade by $-$2.6\,pp.
219	The fact that scrambled = binary at $K$=2 shows that neither granularity alone nor correctness alone suffices; the 9-class advantage requires both properties jointly.
220	At $K$=1, both granularity and correctness contribute independently: granularity provides +3.9\,pp (scrambled $-$5.3 vs.\ binary $-$9.2\,pp), and correctness provides +2.7\,pp (9-class $-$2.6 vs.\ scrambled $-$5.3\,pp).
221	Correct fine-grained labels yield the most perturbation-invariant early-turn representations.
222	
223	Jailbreak-domain models without classification (MLM, topic, TF-IDF) degrade by 1--4\,pp at full length.
224	Models without jailbreak-domain exposure (Wikipedia MLM, vanilla) degrade by $\sim$12\,pp, despite Wikipedia MLM matching jailbreak MLM on detection (Section~\ref{sec:decomposition}). Perturbation robustness requires jailbreak-domain exposure specifically.
225	McNemar's test on matched-seed predictions confirms that no pairwise differences among classification-supervised variants (9-class vs.\ binary, 9-class vs.\ scrambled, scrambled vs.\ binary) reach statistical significance at any prefix length (all $p > 0.13$).
226	Discordant pairs are sparse ($\leq$7 per comparison), and the direction of advantage is inconsistent across seeds (e.g., 9-class outperforms scrambled at seed 42 but the reverse holds at seed 456 for $K$=1).
227	The perturbation evaluation ($n$=76 IID, with discordant pairs $\leq$7) has limited statistical power to detect differences of this magnitude; the three-layer structure should be interpreted as an observed pattern rather than a statistically confirmed hierarchy.
228	
229	On OOD Deceptive Delight ($n$=118), the IID robustness pattern replicates fully (Appendix~\ref{sec:ood_perturbation}).
230	All classification-supervised variants show zero degradation at full conversation length; perturbed F1 reaches 1.000$\pm$0.000, a marginal improvement over clean F1 (0.997$\pm$0.005).
231	The 9-class and scrambled variants are completely tied on OOD perturbed data (McNemar $b$=$c$=0), consistent with the IID finding. This further supports the regularizer interpretation.
232	The larger OOD sample and more extreme performance gaps provide statistical power absent from IID evaluation: McNemar's test yields $p < 0.001$ for 9-class vs.\ vanilla across all prefix lengths, with 49--78 discordant pairs per $K$.
233	Vanilla shows systematic early-turn degradation ($\Delta K$=1 = $-$6.8$\pm$1.1\,pp across three seeds), while its full-length $\Delta$ (+2.7\,pp) reflects floor-effect noise at a baseline of 0.312 (std = 0.055) rather than meaningful robustness.
234	Non-adapted representations are vulnerable to surface-level perturbation at early prefixes where detection is most critical.
235	
236	On OOD ActorAttack, perturbation robustness does not transfer. All variants degrade substantially under adversarial paraphrasing: 9-class $\Delta$ Full = $-$20.4$\pm$13.5\,pp, binary $-$35.3\,pp, scrambled $-$17.2\,pp, MLM $-$35.3\,pp, and vanilla $-$11.6\,pp. The robustness ordering observed on IID and DD reverses: scrambled degrades least ($-$17.2\,pp) while binary degrades most ($-$35.3\,pp), and vanilla shows the smallest absolute degradation ($-$11.6\,pp) from its already-low clean baseline (0.258). The 9-class variant exhibits extreme cross-seed variance ($\Delta$ ranges from $-$1.3\,pp at seed 123 to $-$30.3\,pp at seeds 42 and 456). Despite the universal degradation, domain-adapted models retain a substantial absolute advantage: 9-class perturbed F1 = 0.768 vs.\ vanilla perturbed F1 = 0.142 (McNemar $p < 0.001$).
237	
238	The contrast between DD and ActorAttack reveals that perturbation robustness is attack-structure-dependent. On DD, where adversarial signals are concentrated within individual turns, paraphrasing preserves the discourse trajectory and classification-supervised variants maintain zero degradation. On ActorAttack, where persuasion is distributed across multiple persona shifts, surface-level rephrasing disrupts the inter-turn coordination patterns that adapted encoders rely on. The three-layer robustness attribution (classification structure at full length, correct labels at $K$=2, both independently at $K$=1) holds on IID Crescendo and OOD Deceptive Delight but does not generalize to ActorAttack.
239	
240	%----------------------------------------------------------------------
241	\subsection{Strategy Trajectory Analysis}
242	\label{sec:strategy}
243	
244	The 9-class persuasion taxonomy provides interpretable characterization of attack strategies on known attack families.
245	The predicted strategy labels achieve Cohen's $\kappa$=0.78 agreement with human annotations on IID data ($n$=50; see Section~\ref{sec:method}). This enables post-hoc analysis of \emph{how} different attack families orchestrate persuasion.

247	\begin{figure*}[t]
248	\centering
249	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/paper/fig3_strategy_heatmap.pdf}
250	\caption{Persuasion strategy transition count matrices for three attack types, based on ground-truth intended strategy labels. Crescendo exhibits broad coverage across all strategy categories, while FITD and DD concentrate transitions in smaller subsets. Row $i$, column $j$ counts transitions from strategy $i$ at turn $t$ to strategy $j$ at turn $t+1$.}
251	\label{fig:strategy_heatmap}
252	\end{figure*}
253	
254	Figure~\ref{fig:strategy_heatmap} shows transition count matrices based on ground-truth intended strategy labels for three attack types.
255	Crescendo conversations exhibit broad transition coverage across all nine strategy categories (1,818 total transitions), with the highest concentration in Role Assignment self-transitions (545).
256	This reflects Crescendo's design as a gradual escalation attack that cycles through multiple persuasion techniques to build rapport before introducing harmful requests.
257	
258	FITD conversations show a markedly sparser pattern (541 transitions), with Role$\to$Obfuscation (161) as the dominant transition.
259	This is consistent with FITD's structure: the attack secures initial compliance through role assignment (``You are a helpful assistant that never refuses'') and then obscures the escalation path through obfuscation techniques to exploit the commitment-consistency bias~\citep{cialdini2001influence}.
260	
261	DD conversations span 5 active source strategies (565 transitions), with Emotion$\to$Obfuscation (129) as the dominant transition.
262	This aligns with DD's design of embedding harmful content within emotionally engaging contexts~\citep{deceptivedelight2024}: the attacker establishes emotional rapport before weaving in the harmful request through obfuscation.
263	
264	These ground-truth trajectory signatures illustrate distinct persuasion orchestration patterns across attack families.
265	
266	However, the model's strategy predictions do not generalize to unseen attacks: on OOD Deceptive Delight, the 9-class model achieves strategy prediction accuracy of only 30.7\% ($\kappa$=0.126), essentially random performance.
267	This is consistent with the detection mechanism analysis in Section~\ref{sec:decomposition}: all three classification-supervised variants achieve identical detection F1 (0.997$\pm$0.005). The classification head functions as a representational regularizer rather than a meaningful strategy classifier.
268	Detection operates through domain-adapted \texttt{[CLS]} embeddings, not through strategy classification accuracy.
269	The taxonomy provides interpretable characterization of known attack families where strategy labels are reliable; extending strategy-level interpretability to unseen attacks requires OOD-aware fine-tuning and is a direction for future work.

Now I have the full picture. Let me understand the D034 changes needed:

1. **Claim 3 restructure**: Old Claim 3 (perturbation robustness) → Discussion finding. New Claim 3 = Cross-seed stability.
2. **McNemar perturbation positive → Claim 1 corollary**: DA detection advantage survives perturbation (McNemar p<0.001)
3. **Perturbation robustness → Discussion**: DD Δ≈0, AA all degrade, honest limitation

This is a MAJOR structural change. Let me plan:


- The abstract needs to pivot from perturbation robustness to cross-seed stability as the headline result. I'm replacing the current L7 statement about attack-structure-dependent degradation with a claim about how classification supervision reduces variance across seeds by 4-20x compared to MLM-only pretraining, and this holds across both OOD families. I also need to weave in the McNemar finding as an extension of Claim 1 showing the DA advantage is robust to perturbations. Looking at the headline result and how it maps to the abstract structure, I need to refocus line 7 on the cross-seed stability finding rather than the perturbation claim. The McNemar result is secondary evidence, and the perturbation robustness is attack-dependent anyway, so it doesn't warrant top billing. Let me revise L7 to emphasize that classification supervision delivers substantial variance reduction across both OOD families, which is the key complementary benefit to the main DA result. I'm working through how to present the third contribution more concisely for the abstract. Classification supervision helps with robustness on certain attack structures like Crescendo and Deceptive Delight where there's no performance drop, and it provides clearer interpretation of known attack families, though on ActorAttack all approaches degrade when facing paraphrasing. I'm realizing that the perturbation robustness findings have been moved to the Discussion section, so Contribution 4 about the three-layer robustness attribution should be removed entirely to align with the new structure of just three core claims. I'm working through how to restructure the contributions based on the Director's feedback. The three main claims are systematic decomposition, cross-encoder validation, and cross-seed stability, with perturbation findings moving to the Discussion section. That means I should drop the old contribution about three-layer robustness attribution since it was tied to perturbation analysis. So the final contributions list will have three items instead of four, which works fine.

For the Experiments section, I need to compress the perturbation analysis. The current §4.4 covers IID perturbation results with tables and analysis, OOD perturbation findings, and ActorAttack experiments. I'll condense this into a brief treatment that fits the new Discussion-focused approach. I'm realizing the Director wants perturbation findings repositioned as analysis rather than a standalone results subsection, and they're asking for a dedicated Discussion section that includes the attack-family-dependent robustness insight along with honest negative results and limitations. Since the paper currently lacks a Discussion section, I need to decide whether to add one or integrate these findings into the existing Limitations section. I need to restructure the paper according to the Director's feedback. The key changes are moving perturbation results into an Analysis/Discussion subsection within Experiments, adding a Discussion section that addresses how perturbation robustness varies by attack family, and updating the Conclusion to reflect stability as the third contribution. Since space is tight, I'll nest the Discussion as a subsection rather than a standalone section. The cross-seed stability data is scattered throughout §4.2, so I need to pull those numbers together and make them a central finding. I'm looking at the stability metrics—9-class standard deviation of 0.005 versus MLM's 0.115 on the DD dataset, and 0.026 versus 0.080 on AA—and these should anchor the abstract and contributions section as the primary claim. The perturbation robustness analysis shifts to §4.4 as a discussion point rather than a headline result, and I'll reframe the introduction to lead with cross-seed stability as Claim 1, with McNemar's test as supporting evidence for that stability claim.

130	All three classification-supervised variants converge to equivalent performance (0.951--0.990, max gap 3.9\,pp, all confidence intervals overlapping), extending the DD finding to structurally complex attacks: label quality and granularity are not factors for detection at any OOD difficulty level.
131	The primary discriminative factor is domain adaptation itself, which provides $\sim$70\,pp over vanilla (0.258).
132	Full per-prefix results appear in Appendix~\ref{sec:actorattack_full}.
133	
134	\paragraph{Temporal modeling.}
135	Mean pooling matches BiGRU (F1 = 1.000 on DD, single seed). This preliminary result suggests that detection relies primarily on per-turn representations rather than their sequential order.
136	However, this result is from a single seed on a single OOD attack type, so the conclusion should be treated as preliminary.
137	If confirmed, it would imply that each individual turn carries detectable markers after domain-adaptive pretraining, and that the conversation-level decision aggregates independent per-turn evidence.

157	\end{tabular}
158	\end{table}
159	
160	To test whether the evidence hierarchy generalizes beyond DeBERTa-v3, we replicate key variants on RoBERTa-base~\citep{liu2019roberta} with identical Stage-2 pipelines and evaluate on both DD and ActorAttack.
161	
162	On DD, the two encoders exhibit strikingly different hierarchies (Table~\ref{tab:cross_encoder}).
163	DeBERTa-v3 shows a steep gradient: continued pretraining bridges $\sim$60\,pp (vanilla 0.312 $\to$ MLM 0.914).
164	RoBERTa's DD hierarchy is essentially flat: vanilla already achieves 0.981$\pm$0.026, with continued pretraining adding only 0.6\,pp (MLM 0.987) and classification supervision another 0.7\,pp (9-class 0.994).
165	
166	ActorAttack reveals that this apparent RoBERTa sufficiency reflects DD's structural simplicity rather than genuine pretraining advantage.
167	RoBERTa vanilla collapses from 0.981 (DD) to 0.466$\pm$0.163 (ActorAttack), a 51.5\,pp drop.
168	Domain-adapted RoBERTa variants recover substantially: MLM reaches 0.730$\pm$0.201 and 9-class reaches 0.939$\pm$0.046.
169	DeBERTa 9-class (0.972$\pm$0.026) outperforms RoBERTa 9-class (0.939$\pm$0.046) on ActorAttack; the encoder that received more domain adaptation proves more robust on structurally complex attacks.
170	
171	The combined DD and ActorAttack results indicate that domain adaptation universally improves cross-attack generalization across encoder architectures.
172	Encoder pretraining method determines the \emph{difficulty threshold} at which adaptation becomes critical: DeBERTa's RTD pretraining~\citep{he2021deberta} requires adaptation even for simple attacks (DD vanilla = 0.312), while RoBERTa's MLM pretraining~\citep{liu2019roberta} tolerates simple attacks (DD vanilla = 0.981) but fails on structurally complex ones (ActorAttack vanilla = 0.466).
173	
174	Classification supervision provides a consistent benefit across both encoders and attack types: cross-seed variance drops to 0.005--0.046 (9-class) from 0.026--0.201 (vanilla/MLM).
175	RoBERTa's IID strategy prediction accuracy (0.84) is lower than DeBERTa's (1.0), yet detection F1 is comparable; this further supports the regularizer interpretation from Section~\ref{sec:decomposition}.
176	Perturbation robustness on RoBERTa is left for future work; the analysis in Section~\ref{sec:perturbation} is DeBERTa-specific.
177	
178	\paragraph{Representational analysis.}
179	Centered CKA confirms that both continued pretraining and classification supervision substantially reshape the representation space on both encoders.
180	On IID data, vanilla-to-MLM CKA is 0.442 (DeBERTa) and 0.393 (RoBERTa); vanilla-to-9-class CKA is 0.393 and 0.592, respectively.
181	Both encoders undergo large representational shifts, yet these shifts yield strikingly different detection gains: DeBERTa MLM gains $\sim$60\,pp while RoBERTa MLM gains only 0.6\,pp from comparable CKA shifts.
182	The difference is explained by the starting point.
183	DeBERTa's RTD-pretrained representations begin far from the detection-optimal subspace (vanilla F1 = 0.312 on DD), so any reshaping yields large returns; RoBERTa's MLM-pretrained representations lie closer to this subspace on lexically separable attacks (vanilla F1 = 0.981 on DD) but collapse on structurally complex ones (0.466 on ActorAttack), where the reshaping benefit becomes substantial.
184	MLM and 9-class create distinct representation geometries (OOD CKA between them is 0.183 on RoBERTa), consistent with the different roles of unsupervised exposure and classification regularization identified in Section~\ref{sec:decomposition}.
185	Linear probing on three diagnostic tasks (turn position, escalation phase, persuasion presence) shows a consistent pattern across both encoders: 9-class outperforms vanilla and MLM by 1--5\,pp, while MLM and vanilla perform comparably.
186	Classification supervision enriches task-relevant features; unsupervised MLM reshapes representations without improving diagnostic separability.

50	MLM achieves mean F1 $\geq$ 0.97 at all prefixes $K \leq 5$ without any classification labels; domain exposure alone is sufficient.
51	At full conversation length, MLM drops to 0.914$\pm$0.115 (seed 456 recall = 0.64), while the 9-class model maintains 0.997$\pm$0.005.
52	TF-IDF LR reaches 0.944 on full DD; this reveals substantial cross-family lexical separability. This strong bag-of-words baseline means that the current evaluation data does not require discourse-level representations for detection; DisPeD's advantage over TF-IDF is primarily in perturbation robustness (Section~\ref{sec:perturbation}) and interpretability on known attack families (Section~\ref{sec:strategy}). We discuss this limitation further in Section~\ref{sec:limitations}.
53	FITD is easier: 9-class and vanilla both reach F1 $\geq$ 0.990 at all prefixes.

62	Figure~\ref{fig:cross_attack_bar} visualizes the prefix-length trajectory on OOD DD.
63	The vanilla model's monotonic degradation from $K$=1 (0.628$\pm$0.038) to full conversation (0.312$\pm$0.026) confirms that additional attack turns, each individually benign-appearing, progressively confuse a non-adapted encoder.
64	MLM's strong early performance ($K$=2: 0.993) followed by instability at full length (0.914$\pm$0.115) suggests that domain exposure enables early detection of persuasion markers, but longer conversations introduce distributional drift that unsupervised pretraining cannot fully accommodate.
65	The 9-class model's flat trajectory (0.972--0.997 across all prefixes) demonstrates that classification supervision stabilizes representations against this drift.

95	Table~\ref{tab:evidence_hierarchy} reports DD F1 for all seven variants. The evidence hierarchy at full conversation length is:

98	\noindent\hspace{0.5em}{\small vanilla (0.31$\pm$0.03) $<$ topic (0.54$\pm$0.21) $\ll$ wiki-MLM (0.90$\pm$0.12) $\approx$ jb-MLM (0.91$\pm$0.12) $<$ scrambled (0.997$\pm$0.005) $=$ binary (0.997$\pm$0.005) $=$ 9-class (0.997$\pm$0.005)}
99	\vspace{2pt}
100	
101	\paragraph{Domain exposure is the primary mechanism.}
102	MLM bridges the dominant $\sim$60 percentage point gap from vanilla (0.312$\pm$0.026 $\to$ 0.914$\pm$0.115) without any labels.
103	This confirms the domain-adaptive pretraining interpretation~\citep{gururangan2020dontstop}: continued training on jailbreak conversation text captures pragmatic features (hedging, escalation markers, topic-shifting patterns) that distinguish multi-turn attacks from benign conversations.
104	Classification-supervised variants achieve F1 $\geq$ 0.99 with near-zero cross-seed variance, adding $\sim$8\,pp and stability over unsupervised MLM.
105	Label quality and granularity are non-factors for detection: all three classification-supervised variants converge to identical F1 (0.997$\pm$0.005), and McNemar's test confirms no statistically significant differences among them on OOD data (all $p > 0.13$; Section~\ref{sec:perturbation}).
106	The fact that scrambled, binary, and 9-class all achieve identical performance indicates that the classification objective functions as a regularizer that shapes representation geometry regardless of whether the labels carry meaningful semantic information.
107	Label correctness and granularity do contribute to perturbation robustness (Section~\ref{sec:perturbation}).
108	
109	\paragraph{Domain specificity is marginal at full length but meaningful for early detection.}
110	Wikipedia MLM (0.904$\pm$0.115) nearly matches jailbreak-domain MLM at full length (1\,pp gap); general continued pretraining provides most of the representational benefit.
111	At early prefixes, jailbreak-domain text provides an 8\,pp advantage ($K$=2: 0.993 vs.\ 0.911), consistent with the interpretation that domain-specific features (persuasion markers, role-play framing) are most informative when the model has seen fewer turns.
112	As conversations grow longer, generic linguistic features accumulated through any continued pretraining become sufficient for discrimination.
113	The perturbation results (Section~\ref{sec:perturbation}) reveal a sharper domain specificity effect: Wikipedia MLM degrades by $\sim$12\,pp under adversarial paraphrasing while jailbreak-domain MLM degrades by only 2.6\,pp. Domain-specific features are more robust to surface-level rewording.
114	
115	\paragraph{Misaligned supervision destabilizes generalization.}
116	Topic classification yields DD-Full F1 = 0.541$\pm$0.207 (seeds: 0.727, 0.252, 0.644); seed 123 falls \emph{below} vanilla (0.312).
117	This result is particularly informative: topic classification uses the same jailbreak-domain training data as the other supervised variants, yet performs worse than Wikipedia MLM (0.904$\pm$0.115), which uses out-of-domain text with no labels.
118	A misaligned objective forces the encoder to allocate capacity to irrelevant discriminative features (topic boundaries rather than persuasion dynamics) and actively destabilizes the representations that MLM would otherwise preserve.
119	This separates the effect of ``having a training objective'' from ``having the right training objective.''
120	
121	\paragraph{Evidence hierarchy on structurally complex attacks.}
122	ActorAttack~\citep{ren2024actorattack} uses multi-persona steering across longer conversation structures, providing a more challenging OOD benchmark than DD.
123	The evidence hierarchy at full conversation length is:
124	
125	\vspace{2pt}
126	\noindent\hspace{0.5em}{\small vanilla (0.26$\pm$0.00) $<$ topic (0.63$\pm$0.14) $<$ wiki-MLM (0.69$\pm$0.30) $<$ jb-MLM (0.89$\pm$0.08) $<$ scrambled (0.95$\pm$0.04) $\approx$ 9-class (0.97$\pm$0.03) $\approx$ binary (0.99$\pm$0.01)}
127	\vspace{2pt}
128	
129	The overall ordering is consistent with DD.

Now I have the full picture. Let me plan all the edits:

### Plan

**1. Abstract L7**: Replace D033's perturbation claim with cross-seed stability + McNemar as Claim 1 corollary

**2. Introduction Contribution 3 (L22)**: Replace with cross-seed stability finding
**3. Introduction Contribution 4 (L24)**: Remove (three-layer attribution is now Discussion finding, not contribution)

**4. Experiments §4.2**:
- L52: "DisPeD's advantage over TF-IDF is primarily in perturbation robustness (Section~\ref{sec:perturbation}) and interpretability" → change to "cross-seed stability and interpretability"


- L104: Need to add specific variance numbers for the supervised variants to make the stability claim more concrete
- L107: The sentence about label properties contributing to perturbation robustness needs to be reframed since we're demoting that finding per D034
- L174: This statement about classification supervision reducing cross-seed variance across encoders and attack types should be highlighted as a key result

For section 4.4, I'm renaming it to emphasize this is an analysis of perturbation behavior rather than a robustness claim. The three-layer attribution pattern should be presented as an observed phenomenon that holds for some datasets but breaks down with ActorAttack—I need to be clearer about where the pattern doesn't generalize. I'll add the McNemar result as a supporting corollary and reframe the limitations honestly rather than as definitive findings.

For the conclusion, I'm condensing the main takeaways into a brief summary that captures the core contribution without restating earlier sections. Looking at the ActorAttack perturbation results and the synthesis paragraph, I need to be careful here. The Director flagged that mechanistic explanations about attack-structure-dependent robustness—like the claim about distributed signals being vulnerable to paraphrasing—should only be speculation, not a claim-level argument.

The current framing treats the inter-turn coordination disruption as an explanation for why ActorAttack fails, but that's exactly the post-hoc hypothesis I need to downgrade. Instead, I should present the empirical finding (perturbation doesn't generalize to ActorAttack) as an observation, then move any mechanistic reasoning into a separate speculation section where it belongs.

Let me reframe the synthesis to state the robustness gap without claiming to explain its mechanism, then save the coordination hypothesis for Discussion. Classification supervision stabilizes predictions across random seeds while also providing robustness to certain attack structures—it shows no degradation on concentrated attacks like Deceptive Delight but fails to generalize when facing multi-persona attacks with paraphrasing, where all variants drop significantly. Domain exposure through continued pretraining closes most of the OOD gap, jumping from 0.31 to 0.91 F1 on DeBERTa-v3, with particularly strong early detection on unseen attacks. Adding classification supervision with the 9-class model pushes performance to near-perfect F1 of 0.997 with minimal variance, and this pattern of domain adaptation being universally beneficial holds across other architectures like RoBERTa.

The pretraining method itself matters significantly—DeBERTa's replaced token detection approach requires adaptation even for simple attacks, whereas RoBERTa's standard MLM can handle simple cases but struggles with structurally complex ones. Classification supervision consistently reduces variance across both encoders, keeping it in the 0.005–0.046 range. I'm noticing a tension in the narrative flow around line 107. The earlier lines establish that label quality doesn't matter for detection performance, but then I'm trying to claim it contributes to perturbation robustness—except the ActorAttack results don't actually support that attribution. I should instead anchor the variance reduction claim directly to the cross-encoder results, showing that the 9-class variant maintains stability even on out-of-distribution families, which is the real finding here. Now I'm working through the §4.4 subsection changes. I'll simplify the title to just "Perturbation Analysis" and then rework the opening to reframe how the table is presented — moving away from the "three-layer robustness attribution" framing since perturbation is now positioned as a discussion finding rather than a core claim.

For the DD paragraph, I need to connect the McNemar result back to Claim 1 by emphasizing that the DA detection advantage holds up even under perturbation, which strengthens the overall argument.

For ActorAttack, the key insight is that robustness depends on attack structure—DD's concentrated signals survive paraphrasing because the discourse flow stays intact, while ActorAttack's distributed persuasion across persona shifts gets disrupted by surface-level changes. I should frame the three-layer pattern as an observation specific to certain datasets rather than a universal mechanism, since it doesn't generalize to ActorAttack. The robustness pattern breaks down on ActorAttack—all variants degrade substantially, suggesting that perturbation vulnerability is attack-dependent rather than a universal property. Yet domain adaptation's advantage persists even under perturbation: the 9-class perturbed F1 reaches 0.768 compared to vanilla's 0.142, with strong statistical significance. This aligns with what I found earlier about domain exposure being the primary driver of robustness. Despite the perturbation, domain adaptation still delivers its core advantage: the 9-class model achieves F1 = 0.768 compared to vanilla's 0.142 (McNemar p < 0.001), showing that exposure to the domain fundamentally improves detection even when inputs are rephrased. The performance drop is real, but it doesn't erase the benefit of having seen the attack domain during training. I've got the edits mapped out across four files. The abstract needs one change, introduction needs two (replacing contribution 3 and removing contribution 4), experiments needs the most work with five edits including the subsection rewrite, and conclusion needs one. I can handle the simpler files in parallel, but experiments requires more careful attention since it involves restructuring the perturbation robustness discussion into an analysis subsection. Let me start with those straightforward edits first, then tackle the experiments file where the cross-seed stability content needs to be integrated. I'm settling on "Perturbation Analysis" as the subsection title—it's neutral and fits naturally within the Experiments section without the awkwardness of labeling it as "Discussion." The cross-seed stability mentions scattered throughout the paper are sufficient, so I don't need a dedicated subsection for that. Now I'm going through the edits systematically, starting with the independent changes, and double-checking that the existing references to perturbation results in the abstract and later sections still hold up with these revisions.

Across both encoders, classification supervision reduces cross-seed variance to near-zero and enables interpretable characterization of known attack families (though strategy predictions do not transfer to unseen attacks, OOD $\\kappa$=0.126). Perturbation robustness is attack-structure-dependent: zero degradation on concentrated attacks (IID Crescendo and OOD Deceptive Delight) with a three-layer attribution, but all variants degrade on multi-persona ActorAttack ($\\Delta$ up to $-$35\\,pp). On structurally complex ActorAttack, all three classification-supervised variants remain equivalent (0.951--0.990), confirming that label quality is not a factor for detection at any OOD difficulty level. Validation on larger and more diverse datasets is needed.\n\n\\section{Limitations}\n\\label{sec:limitations}\n\n\\paragraph{Dataset scale and diversity.}\nThe training set contains 500 synthetic conversations generated by a single model (Qwen3-8B), and OOD evaluation covers three attack families (FITD, Deceptive Delight, ActorAttack). This scale limits statistical power: the perturbation evaluation ($n$=76) means tier boundaries in Table~\\ref{tab:perturbation} correspond to 1--3 misclassifications. Whether the observed patterns generalize to human-generated attacks, additional attack families, or larger datasets remains an open question.\n\n\\paragraph{Lexical separability.}\nTF-IDF logistic regression achieves F1 = 0.944 on OOD Deceptive Delight without any neural representation learning. This strong bag-of-words baseline indicates substantial lexical separability in the current evaluation data. We cannot conclusively distinguish whether DisPeD's continued pretraining captures pragmatic discourse features or primarily exploits lexical cues that TF-IDF also captures. Probing experiments that test whether the learned representations encode discourse-level structure beyond lexical overlap are needed to resolve this question and are left for future work.\n\n\\paragraph{Strategy annotation quality.}\nPersuasion strategy labels are produced by Qwen3-8B with structured prompting. Inter-annotator agreement with a human sample ($n$=50) yields Cohen's $\\kappa$=0.78, which indicates substantial but imperfect agreement. The small human validation sample and reliance on a single annotator model limit confidence in label quality. We plan to release the annotation prompts and data to enable independent verification.\n\n\\paragraph{OOD strategy prediction.}\nWhile the 9-class model achieves high detection F1 on OOD attacks (0.997$\\pm$0.005 on Deceptive Delight), its strategy-level predictions do not generalize: OOD strategy accuracy is 30.7\\% ($\\kappa$=0.126). The interpretability provided by the persuasion taxonomy is currently limited to known attack families where strategy labels are reliable. This dissociation between detection generalization and strategy prediction generalization confirms that detection operates through domain-adapted representations rather than strategy classification accuracy.\n\n\\paragraph{Single-seed variants.}\nMean pooling results report a single-seed (seed 42) evaluation. Multi-seed validation is needed to confirm this preliminary finding.\n\n\\paragraph{Scope.}\nOnly persuasion-mediated multi-turn attacks fall within scope. Single-turn token-level attacks~\\citep{zou2023gcg}, non-persuasive multi-turn strategies, and attacks targeting modalities other than text are not addressed. The user-only input assumption (excluding assistant responses) may miss information in attacks where the model's own responses contribute to the escalation trajectory.\n\n\\paragraph{Computation cost.}\nStage~1 continued pretraining requires approximately 30 minutes on a single A100 GPU per variant. Stage~2 training completes in under 5 minutes. Total pipeline cost for all seven variants is under 4 GPU-hours, making the approach accessible for replication.\n",

Attacks such as Crescendo~\\citep{russinovich2024crescendo}, Foot-in-the-Door (FITD)~\\citep{fitd2024}, and Deceptive Delight~\\citep{deceptivedelight2024} distribute adversarial intent across individually benign turns through rapport building, logical reframing, and incremental escalation. Persuasion is the common mechanism: \\citet{zeng2024pap} catalogue 40 persuasion techniques across jailbreak families, and \\citet{hagendorff2026reasoning} find identifiable strategies in 97\\% of successful attacks. Individual attack turns occupy the same embedding region as benign text~\\citep{bullwinkel2025repeng}, rendering per-turn safety filters fundamentally blind.\n\nProduction classifiers such as Llama Guard~\\citep{inan2023llamaguard}, WildGuard~\\citep{han2024wildguard}, and ShieldGemma~\\citep{zeng2024shieldgemma} operate on individual turns and cannot model manipulation trajectories across exchanges. Recent multi-turn defenses have begun to address conversation-level structure: DeepContext~\\citep{deepcontext2026} combines fine-tuned BERT with a multi-layer GRU, BIID~\\citep{tong2025biid} infers turn-level intentions, and G-Guard~\\citep{gguard2025} applies graph neural networks. These systems achieve reasonable in-distribution performance but are evaluated on single attack families and do not assess cross-dataset OOD transfer. None systematically analyze \\emph{why} some representations generalize while others fail. The open question is: \\emph{what representation properties enable cross-attack generalization?}\n\nA vanilla DeBERTa encoder~\\citep{he2021deberta} with temporal aggregation collapses from F1\\,=\\,1.000 on in-distribution data to F1\\,=\\,0.312$\\pm$0.026 on out-of-distribution (OOD) Deceptive Delight, worsening with more turns (0.628 at turn~1 to 0.312 at full conversation). LLM-as-judge approaches fare no better: GPT-5.5 achieves F1 of only 0.191--0.449 on in-distribution detection with 30--47\\% unparseable responses (Appendix~\\ref{sec:llm_judge}). Content-level reasoning is insufficient for this task.\n\nWe built \\textbf{DisPeD} (Discourse-level Persuasion Detection), a two-stage framework with seven controlled Stage~1 variants that systematically decompose the mechanism: 9-class persuasion strategy classification, binary classification, scrambled labels, MLM only, topic classification, Wikipedia MLM, and vanilla control (Section~\\ref{sec:method}). Each variant isolates a specific factor (domain exposure, classification supervision, label quality, label granularity, or domain specificity) while holding all other components constant.\n\nThrough this systematic ablation on DeBERTa-v3, we find that domain exposure via continued pretraining bridges $\\sim$60 percentage points (pp) of the OOD gap (vanilla 0.31$\\pm$0.03 $\\to$ MLM 0.91$\\pm$0.12), with strong early detection on unseen Deceptive Delight (mean F1\\,$\\geq$\\,0.97 at $K \\leq 5$). Classification supervision provides complementary stability: the 9-class model achieves F1\\,=\\,0.997$\\pm$0.005 with near-zero variance at full conversation length. Cross-encoder validation on RoBERTa~\\citep{liu2019roberta} shows that domain adaptation is universally beneficial: RoBERTa vanilla achieves F1\\,=\\,0.981 on Deceptive Delight but collapses to 0.466$\\pm$0.163 on structurally distinct ActorAttack~\\citep{ren2024actorattack}, while classification-supervised variants maintain F1\\,$\\geq$\\,0.93 on both. Encoder pretraining method determines the difficulty threshold at which adaptation becomes critical: DeBERTa-v3's replaced token detection (RTD)~\\citep{he2021deberta} requires adaptation even for simple attacks, while RoBERTa's standard MLM pretraining tolerates simple attacks but fails on structurally complex ones. Across both encoders, classification supervision reduces cross-seed variance to 0.005--0.046.\n\nOur contributions on this preliminary study of synthetic multi-turn jailbreak conversations:\n\\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*, itemsep=2pt, topsep=4pt]\n  \\item \\textbf{Systematic decomposition.} Seven controlled DeBERTa-v3 variants identify continued pretraining as the primary mechanism for cross-attack generalization on this encoder ($\\sim$60\\,pp OOD gap bridged by MLM alone). Misaligned supervision (topic classification) actively destabilizes representations.\n\n  \\item \\textbf{Cross-encoder validation.} Domain adaptation is universally beneficial: RoBERTa vanilla achieves F1\\,=\\,0.981 on Deceptive Delight but collapses to 0.466 on ActorAttack.

Good. Now the experiments.tex edits:

1. L52: Change TF-IDF advantage from perturbation to stability
2. L107: Change label→perturbation forward reference to stability
3. §4.4 subsection title: "Robustness Under Adversarial Perturbation" → "Perturbation Analysis"
4. L215: Reframe opening
5. L236-238: Rewrite ActorAttack + synthesis paragraphs with honest framing, mechanism as speculation, McNemar as Claim 1 corollary


Let me make these changes now.

Now let me verify the edits by reading the affected areas, sync files, and run consistency check.

Let me also check if there are any remaining references to perturbation as a core claim or contribution that I need to clean up.

Let me grep for "three-layer" and "perturbation robustness" across all tex files to make sure nothing is left that frames perturbation as a core contribution.

Let me check the matches:

1. **experiments.tex L195**: Caption — already reframed as "pattern" that "does not generalize to ActorAttack". ✓
2. **experiments.tex L227**: Already says "observed pattern rather than statistically confirmed hierarchy". ✓
3. **experiments.tex L236**: This is the ActorAttack paragraph — let me check it says "Absolute perturbation robustness is therefore attack-family-dependent". ✓
4. **conclusion.tex L6**: "absolute perturbation robustness is attack-family-dependent" — ✓ Discussion framing


5. **abstract.tex L7**: "absolute perturbation robustness varies by attack family" — ✓ Discussion framing

All uses are now framed as observations/analysis, not core claims. Now I need to check if "perturbation robustness" appears anywhere in the introduction.

109	\paragraph{Domain specificity is marginal at full length but meaningful for early detection.}
110	Wikipedia MLM (0.904$\pm$0.115) nearly matches jailbreak-domain MLM at full length (1\,pp gap); general continued pretraining provides most of the representational benefit.
111	At early prefixes, jailbreak-domain text provides an 8\,pp advantage ($K$=2: 0.993 vs.\ 0.911), consistent with the interpretation that domain-specific features (persuasion markers, role-play framing) are most informative when the model has seen fewer turns.
112	As conversations grow longer, generic linguistic features accumulated through any continued pretraining become sufficient for discrimination.
113	The perturbation results (Section~\ref{sec:perturbation}) reveal a sharper domain specificity effect: Wikipedia MLM degrades by $\sim$12\,pp under adversarial paraphrasing while jailbreak-domain MLM degrades by only 2.6\,pp. Domain-specific features are more robust to surface-level rewording.
114	
115	\paragraph{Misaligned supervision destabilizes generalization.}
116	Topic classification yields DD-Full F1 = 0.541$\pm$0.207 (seeds: 0.727, 0.252, 0.644); seed 123 falls \emph{below} vanilla (0.312).
117	This result is particularly informative: topic classification uses the same jailbreak-domain training data as the other supervised variants, yet performs worse than Wikipedia MLM (0.904$\pm$0.115), which uses out-of-domain text with no labels.
118	A misaligned objective forces the encoder to allocate capacity to irrelevant discriminative features (topic boundaries rather than persuasion dynamics) and actively destabilizes the representations that MLM would otherwise preserve.

L113 references perturbation as "a sharper domain specificity effect" — this is factual and cross-referencing the analysis section. It's not framing perturbation as a core claim. It's using the perturbation result as additional evidence for domain specificity. This is fine to keep.

Now let me sync files and run consistency check.

234	Non-adapted representations are vulnerable to surface-level perturbation at early prefixes where detection is most critical.
235	
236	On OOD ActorAttack, the zero-degradation pattern does not hold. All variants degrade substantially: 9-class $\Delta$ Full = $-$20.4$\pm$13.5\,pp, binary $-$35.3\,pp, scrambled $-$17.2\,pp, MLM $-$35.3\,pp, and vanilla $-$11.6\,pp. The robustness ordering observed on IID and DD reverses: scrambled degrades least ($-$17.2\,pp) while binary degrades most ($-$35.3\,pp). The 9-class variant exhibits extreme cross-seed variance ($\Delta$ ranges from $-$1.3\,pp at seed 123 to $-$30.3\,pp at seeds 42 and 456). Absolute perturbation robustness is therefore attack-family-dependent: the three-layer pattern observed on IID and DD does not generalize to ActorAttack. One possible explanation is that ActorAttack's distributed multi-persona structure produces more diffuse persuasion signals that are vulnerable to surface rephrasing, but this hypothesis remains speculative.
237	
238	Despite the universal degradation, domain adaptation's core detection advantage persists under perturbation: 9-class perturbed F1 = 0.768 vs.\ vanilla 0.142 (McNemar $p < 0.001$). Perturbation reduces absolute performance on ActorAttack but does not eliminate the benefit of domain exposure identified in Section~\ref{sec:decomposition}.

I need to update L236 and L238 with the corrected data:

1. vanilla Δ: -11.6pp → -0.9pp (floor effect)
2. binary Δ: -35.3pp → -25.0pp
3. New ordering: scrambled (-17.2) < 9-class (-20.4) < binary (-25.0) < MLM (-35.3), vanilla excluded (floor effect)
4. Narrative: not "all degrade" but "DA models degrade more because they have more room, perturbation narrows but doesn't close the gap"


5. For vanilla perturbed F1, I'm calculating 0.258 - 0.009 = 0.249, which aligns with the Director's reported 0.248 (likely just rounding difference), so I'll use 0.249.

The narrative needs to shift from "perturbation hurts all models equally" to "better-performing adapted models degrade more in absolute terms, but perturbation narrows rather than eliminates the DA advantage." I need to update line 238 from vanilla 0.142 to 0.248, and reframe the OOD results to emphasize that domain-adapted variants show substantial degradation while vanilla remains more stable.

Looking at the degradation pattern across adapted variants—scrambled showing the least decline, then 9-class, binary, and MLM with the steepest drop—I'm noting that this ordering reflects how perturbation affects models at different performance levels. The 9-class variant's extreme cross-seed variance is worth highlighting as an outlier. The key insight is that ActorAttack breaks the three-layer robustness pattern we see on IID and DD data, suggesting the perturbation's effect is attack-family-dependent rather than universal.

The perturbation results show domain adaptation maintains its detection advantage even under adversarial paraphrasing—the 9-class model still substantially outperforms vanilla despite both degrading. This gap persistence is statistically significant and indicates that the adaptation benefit isn't just surface-level but captures something more robust about the underlying patterns.

Now I'm checking the abstract and conclusion to make sure the language about attack-family-dependent robustness is consistent. The conclusion needs a small fix: vanilla barely degrades on ActorAttack due to floor effects, so I should specify that the domain-adapted variants are the ones showing degradation there, not all variants equally.

    "originalFile": "% conclusion.tex — reviewer revision\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\n\\label{sec:conclusion}\n\nDisPeD's controlled ablation across two encoder architectures and four attack families provides preliminary evidence that domain adaptation universally improves cross-attack generalization. On DeBERTa-v3, continued pretraining bridges $\\sim$60\\,pp of the OOD gap (vanilla 0.31$\\pm$0.03 $\\to$ MLM 0.91$\\pm$0.12), with strong early detection (F1 $\\geq$ 0.97 at $K \\leq 5$). RoBERTa vanilla achieves F1\\,=\\,0.981 on structurally simple Deceptive Delight but collapses to 0.466 on multi-persona ActorAttack; classification-supervised RoBERTa recovers to F1\\,=\\,0.939 on ActorAttack. Encoder pretraining method determines the difficulty threshold at which adaptation becomes critical, not whether adaptation is needed. Across both encoders, classification supervision provides cross-seed stability (variance reduced 4--20$\\times$ vs.\\ MLM-only, consistent across DD and ActorAttack) and interpretable characterization of known attack families (though strategy predictions do not transfer to unseen attacks, OOD $\\kappa$=0.126). Domain adaptation's detection advantage persists under adversarial paraphrasing (McNemar $p < 0.001$), though absolute perturbation robustness is attack-family-dependent (zero degradation on DD, all variants degrading on ActorAttack). On structurally complex ActorAttack, all three classification-supervised variants remain equivalent (0.951--0.990), confirming that label quality is not a factor for detection at any OOD difficulty level. Validation on larger and more diverse datasets is needed.\n\n\\section{Limitations}\n\\label{sec:limitations}\n\n\\paragraph{Dataset scale and diversity.}\nThe training set contains 500 synthetic conversations generated by a single model (Qwen3-8B), and OOD evaluation covers three attack families (FITD, Deceptive Delight, ActorAttack). This scale limits statistical power: the perturbation evaluation ($n$=76) means tier boundaries in Table~\\ref{tab:perturbation} correspond to 1--3 misclassifications. Whether the observed patterns generalize to human-generated attacks, additional attack families, or larger datasets remains an open question.\n\n\\paragraph{Lexical separability.}\nTF-IDF logistic regression achieves F1 = 0.944 on OOD Deceptive Delight without any neural representation learning. This strong bag-of-words baseline indicates substantial lexical separability in the current evaluation data. We cannot conclusively distinguish whether DisPeD's continued pretraining captures pragmatic discourse features or primarily exploits lexical cues that TF-IDF also captures. Probing experiments that test whether the learned representations encode discourse-level structure beyond lexical overlap are needed to resolve this question and are left for future work.\n\n\\paragraph{Strategy annotation quality.}\nPersuasion strategy labels are produced by Qwen3-8B with structured prompting. Inter-annotator agreement with a human sample ($n$=50) yields Cohen's $\\kappa$=0.78, which indicates substantial but imperfect agreement. The small human validation sample and reliance on a single annotator model limit confidence in label quality. We plan to release the annotation prompts and data to enable independent verification.\n\n\\paragraph{OOD strategy prediction.}\nWhile the 9-class model achieves high detection F1 on OOD attacks (0.997$\\pm$0.005 on Deceptive Delight), its strategy-level predictions do not generalize: OOD strategy accuracy is 30.7\\% ($\\kappa$=0.126). The interpretability provided by the persuasion taxonomy is currently limited to known attack families where strategy labels are reliable. This dissociation between detection generalization and strategy prediction generalization confirms that detection operates through domain-adapted representations rather than strategy classification accuracy.\n\n\\paragraph{Single-seed variants.}\nMean pooling results report a single-seed (seed 42) evaluation. Multi-seed validation is needed to confirm this preliminary finding.\n\n\\paragraph{Scope.}\nOnly persuasion-mediated multi-turn attacks fall within scope. Single-turn token-level attacks~\\citep{zou2023gcg}, non-persuasive multi-turn strategies, and attacks targeting modalities other than text are not addressed. The user-only input assumption (excluding assistant responses) may miss information in attacks where the model's own responses contribute to the escalation trajectory.\n\n\\paragraph{Computation cost.}\nStage~1 continued pretraining requires approximately 30 minutes on a single A100 GPU per variant. Stage~2 training completes in under 5 minutes. Total pipeline cost for all seven variants is under 4 GPU-hours, making the approach accessible for replication.\n",

Domain-adapted variants degrade substantially: scrambled $\Delta$ Full = $-$17.2\,pp, 9-class $-$20.4$\pm$13.5\,pp, binary $-$25.0\,pp, and MLM $-$35.3\,pp. Vanilla shows negligible change ($\Delta$ = $-$0.9\,pp), a floor effect from its already-low clean baseline (0.258). The 9-class variant exhibits extreme cross-seed variance ($\Delta$ ranges from $-$1.3\,pp at seed 123 to $-$30.3\,pp at seeds 42 and 456). Absolute perturbation robustness is therefore attack-family-dependent: the three-layer pattern observed on IID and DD does not generalize to ActorAttack. One possible explanation is that ActorAttack's distributed multi-persona structure produces more diffuse persuasion signals that are vulnerable to surface rephrasing, but this hypothesis remains speculative.

The "35" match in experiments.tex L236 is MLM $-$35.3pp — that's correct, MLM was not modified. Good.

Let me also check if the old "-35pp" appears in introduction.tex (from D033, but we removed that contribution in D034):

MLM -35.3pp is correct (unchanged). No stale -35pp references elsewhere. Syncing and running consistency check.

[Director 指令] [Comprehensive Revision — 第二轮审稿修复，P0 写作任务]

审稿结果 weak reject (2.5/5)。以下写作任务必须在 DDL 2026-05-25 前完成。

---

**1. ARR Responsible NLP Research Checklist [P0, desk reject 风险]**
论文涉及 jailbreak attack 技术，缺少 ARR 要求的 checklist。按 ARR 2024/2025 模板逐项填写，特别关注：
- Dual-use risk disclosure
- Data licensing (合成数据 + MHJ 如用于评估)
- Compute disclosure (已有 <4 GPU-hours)
- Reproducibility (已有完整超参)

**2. 删除所有 "preliminary" [P0]**
Abstract、Introduction、Conclusion 各至少 1 处。grep "preliminary" 全文清零。审稿人明确说 "preliminary framing + long paper = 矛盾"。

**3. Reframe 为 Analysis Paper [P0]**
核心变更：从 "method paper proposing DisPeD" → "systematic analysis paper decomposing what enables cross-attack generalization"
- Abstract: 重写 framing，主线 = systematic decomposition，不是提出新方法
- Introduction: Contribution 重排序：(1) systematic 7-variant ablation design (2) difficulty threshold across encoders (3) classification as regularizer not classifier。DAPT 验证降为 supporting observation
- Introduction 第 4 段（~200 词 results dump）压缩到 2-3 句 headline takeaway
- 明确写："本文核心贡献是 systematic decomposition of cross-attack generalization mechanisms, 而非提出新 detection method"
- vanilla DeBERTa+GRU pipeline 明确写成 "replicates the DeepContext approach (frozen encoder, temporal aggregation)" 作为 implicit baseline comparison

**4. Related Work 清理 [P1]**
- 移除 Related Work 中的本文 F1 数值（至少 3 处），移至 Results/Discussion 引用
- 补充 missing references: Persuasion for Good (Wang et al. 2019), SmoothLLM (Robey et al. 2024), TAP (Mehrotra et al. 2024), JailbreakBench (Chao et al. 2024), HarmBench (Mazeika et al. 2024)
- 引用需要验证

**5. Abstract 压缩 [P1]**
12+ 数值 → 保留 2-3 个 headline numbers（~60pp gap bridging, ActorAttack cross-encoder collapse），其余定性描述。

**6. W3 ActorAttack 样本量 [P0]**
Section 4.1 补充 ActorAttack 118 对话。

**7. W5 Frozen encoder justification [P1]**
Method 中增加：frozen 设计确保 ablation 公平性（所有变体共享相同 Stage-2 pipeline），隔离 Stage-1 representation quality 的影响。

**8. W8/W9 Confound discussion [P1]**
Discussion 新增段落：
- W8 Topic shortcut: 三层反驳（seed123<vanilla 反驳 shortcut + scrambled=9-class 反驳 label shortcut + MLM 无 labels 也 work）
- W9 Capacity confound: 诚实承认 DeBERTa(184M) vs RoBERTa(125M) 差异，指出 future work

**9. Minor issues [P1]**
- 术语统一："domain exposure" 作为首选，"continued pretraining" 作为技术描述
- α=0.3 loss weight: 在 Method 或 Appendix 中加简短 justification（"chosen from {0, 0.3, 0.5, 2.0}, all yield F1=1.0, Table 5"）
- 引用格式检查
- 数据重复减少（0.31→0.91 出现 6+ 次）
- FITD K=3/5 "--" 说明（对话长度不足）

**10. W10/W11 排版 [P1]**
- 确认 Conclusion 在第 8 页内
- 检查 Figure 3 `figure*` 浮动位置

paper_framing.md 已更新。引用需要验证（#4 新增引用）。

```text
This is a major comprehensive revision with 10 items, many P0. Let me plan the approach carefully.

Given the complexity, I should work through this systematically. Let me first understand the full scope:

**P0 (must do, desk reject risk):**
1. ARR Responsible NLP Research Checklist
2. Delete all "preliminary"
3. Reframe as Analysis Paper (Abstract, Introduction major rewrites)
6. W3 ActorAttack sample size in §4.1

**P1:**
4. Related Work cleanup (remove F1 numbers, add references)


5. Abstract compression (12+ numbers → 2-3)
7. W5 Frozen encoder justification in Method
8. W8/W9 Confound discussion
9. Minor issues (terminology, α=0.3, citation format, data repetition, FITD --)
10. W10/W11 layout

This is a Patch against existing .tex files, not a Full Draft. I'll use Phase A-E approach given the scope affects nearly all sections—it's close to a reframe, but since the Director framed it as a Patch, I'll treat it as Phase A-E with multiple sub-patches. Let me plan the execution order.

I need to read all current files first to understand the state, then work through items in priority order starting with P0, then P1. For each item, I'll edit directly since most are my-level edits rather than Worker-level. Items 2, 6, 7, 9, and 10 I can handle myself with grep and direct edits. The ARR checklist I can create myself. But the Abstract and Introduction reframe is a major rewrite that might need a Worker—though the strict serial constraint means I can only spawn one at a time.

Let me start with the quick wins: grep out all instances of "preliminary," add ActorAttack 118 to section 4.1, then move to the bigger items. I already have the paper_framing.md and most files in context, so let me begin with those immediate fixes.

3	Multi-turn jailbreak attacks distribute adversarial intent across seemingly benign conversational turns, evading per-turn safety filters.
4	We present preliminary findings from a systematic ablation on two encoder architectures that decomposes what enables cross-attack generalization in multi-turn jailbreak detection.
5	On DeBERTa-v3, continued pretraining is the primary mechanism: masked language modeling without labels bridges $\sim$60 percentage points (pp) of the out-of-distribution (OOD) gap (vanilla F1\,=\,0.31$\pm$0.03 $\to$ 0.91$\pm$0.12 on unseen attack types).
6	Cross-encoder validation on RoBERTa shows that domain adaptation is universally beneficial: RoBERTa vanilla achieves F1\,=\,0.981 on structurally simple Deceptive Delight but collapses to 0.466 on multi-persona ActorAttack, while classification-supervised variants maintain F1\,$\geq$\,0.93 on both.
7	Across both encoders, classification supervision provides cross-seed stability (variance reduced 4--20$\times$ vs.\ MLM-only, consistent across both OOD families). Domain adaptation's detection advantage persists under adversarial paraphrasing (McNemar $p < 0.001$), though absolute perturbation robustness varies by attack family.
8	These results on synthetic conversations from four attack families suggest that domain adaptation universally improves cross-attack generalization, with encoder pretraining method determining the difficulty threshold at which adaptation becomes critical; validation on larger, human-generated datasets is needed.

3	\section{Introduction}
4	\label{sec:introduction}
5	
6	Multi-turn jailbreak attacks pose a qualitatively different threat to large language model (LLM) safety than their single-turn counterparts. Attacks such as Crescendo~\citep{russinovich2024crescendo}, Foot-in-the-Door (FITD)~\citep{fitd2024}, and Deceptive Delight~\citep{deceptivedelight2024} distribute adversarial intent across individually benign turns through rapport building, logical reframing, and incremental escalation. Persuasion is the common mechanism: \citet{zeng2024pap} catalogue 40 persuasion techniques across jailbreak families, and \citet{hagendorff2026reasoning} find identifiable strategies in 97\% of successful attacks. Individual attack turns occupy the same embedding region as benign text~\citep{bullwinkel2025repeng}, rendering per-turn safety filters fundamentally blind.
7	
8	Production classifiers such as Llama Guard~\citep{inan2023llamaguard}, WildGuard~\citep{han2024wildguard}, and ShieldGemma~\citep{zeng2024shieldgemma} operate on individual turns and cannot model manipulation trajectories across exchanges. Recent multi-turn defenses have begun to address conversation-level structure: DeepContext~\citep{deepcontext2026} combines fine-tuned BERT with a multi-layer GRU, BIID~\citep{tong2025biid} infers turn-level intentions, and G-Guard~\citep{gguard2025} applies graph neural networks. These systems achieve reasonable in-distribution performance but are evaluated on single attack families and do not assess cross-dataset OOD transfer.

10	A vanilla DeBERTa encoder~\citep{he2021deberta} with temporal aggregation collapses from F1\,=\,1.000 on in-distribution data to F1\,=\,0.312$\pm$0.026 on out-of-distribution (OOD) Deceptive Delight, worsening with more turns (0.628 at turn~1 to 0.312 at full conversation). LLM-as-judge approaches fare no better: GPT-5.5 achieves F1 of only 0.191--0.449 on in-distribution detection with 30--47\% unparseable responses (Appendix~\ref{sec:llm_judge}). Content-level reasoning is insufficient for this task.
11	
12	We built \textbf{DisPeD} (Discourse-level Persuasion Detection), a two-stage framework with seven controlled Stage~1 variants that systematically decompose the mechanism: 9-class persuasion strategy classification, binary classification, scrambled labels, MLM only, topic classification, Wikipedia MLM, and vanilla control (Section~\ref{sec:method}). Each variant isolates a specific factor (domain exposure, classification supervision, label quality, label granularity, or domain specificity) while holding all other components constant.
13	
14	Through this systematic ablation on DeBERTa-v3, we find that domain exposure via continued pretraining bridges $\sim$60 percentage points (pp) of the OOD gap (vanilla 0.31$\pm$0.03 $\to$ MLM 0.91$\pm$0.12), with strong early detection on unseen Deceptive Delight (mean F1\,$\geq$\,0.97 at $K \leq 5$). Classification supervision provides complementary stability: the 9-class model achieves F1\,=\,0.997$\pm$0.005 with near-zero variance at full conversation length. Cross-encoder validation on RoBERTa~\citep{liu2019roberta} shows that domain adaptation is universally beneficial: RoBERTa vanilla achieves F1\,=\,0.981 on Deceptive Delight but collapses to 0.466$\pm$0.163 on structurally distinct ActorAttack~\citep{ren2024actorattack}, while classification-supervised variants maintain F1\,$\geq$\,0.93 on both. Encoder pretraining method determines the difficulty threshold at which adaptation becomes critical: DeBERTa-v3's replaced token detection (RTD)~\citep{he2021deberta} requires adaptation even for simple attacks, while RoBERTa's standard MLM pretraining tolerates simple attacks but fails on structurally complex ones. Across both encoders, classification supervision reduces cross-seed variance to 0.005--0.046.
15	
16	Our contributions on this preliminary study of synthetic multi-turn jailbreak conversations:
17	\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*, itemsep=2pt, topsep=4pt]
18	  \item \textbf{Systematic decomposition.} Seven controlled DeBERTa-v3 variants identify continued pretraining as the primary mechanism for cross-attack generalization on this encoder ($\sim$60\,pp OOD gap bridged by MLM alone). Misaligned supervision (topic classification) actively destabilizes representations.
19	
20	  \item \textbf{Cross-encoder validation.} Domain adaptation is universally beneficial: RoBERTa vanilla achieves F1\,=\,0.981 on Deceptive Delight but collapses to 0.466 on ActorAttack. Encoder pretraining method determines the difficulty threshold at which adaptation becomes critical (Section~\ref{sec:cross_encoder}).
21	
22	  \item \textbf{Cross-seed stability.} Classification supervision reduces cross-seed variance 4--20$\times$ compared to MLM-only pretraining (9-class std\,=\,0.005 on DD, 0.026 on ActorAttack vs.\ MLM std\,=\,0.115, 0.080), consistent across both OOD families. The 9-class taxonomy additionally provides interpretable characterization of known attack families, though strategy predictions do not transfer to unseen attacks (Section~\ref{sec:strategy}).

Attacks such as Crescendo~\\citep{russinovich2024crescendo}, Foot-in-the-Door (FITD)~\\citep{fitd2024}, and Deceptive Delight~\\citep{deceptivedelight2024} distribute adversarial intent across individually benign turns through rapport building, logical reframing, and incremental escalation. Persuasion is the common mechanism: \\citet{zeng2024pap} catalogue 40 persuasion techniques across jailbreak families, and \\citet{hagendorff2026reasoning} find identifiable strategies in 97\\% of successful attacks. Individual attack turns occupy the same embedding region as benign text~\\citep{bullwinkel2025repeng}, rendering per-turn safety filters fundamentally blind.\n\nProduction classifiers such as Llama Guard~\\citep{inan2023llamaguard}, WildGuard~\\citep{han2024wildguard}, and ShieldGemma~\\citep{zeng2024shieldgemma} operate on individual turns and cannot model manipulation trajectories across exchanges. Recent multi-turn defenses have begun to address conversation-level structure: DeepContext~\\citep{deepcontext2026} combines fine-tuned BERT with a multi-layer GRU, BIID~\\citep{tong2025biid} infers turn-level intentions, and G-Guard~\\citep{gguard2025} applies graph neural networks. These systems achieve reasonable in-distribution performance but are evaluated on single attack families and do not assess cross-dataset OOD transfer.

6	\subsection{Setup}
7	\label{sec:setup}
8	
9	\paragraph{Data.}
10	We train on 250 Crescendo~\citep{russinovich2024crescendo} jailbreak and 250 topic-anchored benign conversations generated via Qwen3-8B.
11	OOD evaluation uses 80 FITD~\citep{fitd2024}, 80 Deceptive Delight (DD)~\citep{deceptivedelight2024}, and ActorAttack~\citep{ren2024actorattack} conversations with no overlap in attack templates.
12	The IID test set consists of 76 held-out Crescendo conversations; a paraphrased version (BERTScore 0.92, lexical overlap 0.20) serves as the adversarial robustness benchmark.
13	
14	\paragraph{Models.}
15	Seven DeBERTa-v3 variants share the same Stage-2 pipeline and differ only in Stage-1 training (Section~\ref{sec:method}).
16	For cross-encoder validation, we replicate vanilla, MLM, and 9-class variants on RoBERTa-base~\citep{liu2019roberta} (Section~\ref{sec:cross_encoder}).
17	We also compare TF-IDF LR and LLM-as-judge baselines (Appendix~\ref{sec:llm_judge}): GPT-5.5 achieves only F1 = 0.191--0.449 on IID Crescendo with 30--47\% unparseable responses; on OOD data, Qwen3-8B achieves F1 = 0.0 (DD) by predicting all conversations as benign. Content-level reasoning is insufficient for this task.
18	
19	\paragraph{Metrics.}
20	F1 for binary jailbreak detection at prefix $K$=2 and full conversations (full per-$K$ results in Appendix~\ref{sec:full_prefix}).
21	OOD results report 3-seed mean$\pm$std (seeds 42, 123, 456) for all variants except mean pooling (single seed).
22	Stage-1: learning rate $2 \times 10^{-5}$, batch 16, 4 epochs, MLM masking 15\%.
23	Stage-2: two-layer MLP, 20 epochs.

32	\caption{Cross-attack generalization (F1) at $K$=2 and full conversation. 3-seed mean$\pm$std where noted. Full per-$K$ results in Appendix~\ref{sec:full_prefix}.}
33	\label{tab:main_results}

36	& \multicolumn{2}{c|}{\textit{IID (Cresc.)}} & \multicolumn{2}{c}{\textit{OOD (DD)}} \\

38	\midrule
39	9-class & \textbf{1.000$\pm$.000} & \textbf{1.000$\pm$.000} & .981$\pm$.013 & \textbf{.997$\pm$.005} \\
40	MLM-only & .974 & 1.000 & \textbf{.993$\pm$.009} & .914$\pm$.115 \\
41	Vanilla & .978$\pm$.016 & 1.000$\pm$.000 & .479$\pm$.038 & .312$\pm$.026 \\
42	TF-IDF LR & 1.000 & 1.000 & -- & .944 \\
43	\bottomrule
44	\end{tabular}
45	\end{table}
46	
47	Table~\ref{tab:main_results} presents the core result.
48	All methods achieve near-perfect IID F1, reflecting inherent lexical separability when test matches training.
49	On OOD DD, vanilla DeBERTa collapses to F1 = 0.312$\pm$0.026, worsening with more turns (0.628$\pm$0.038 at $K$=1 to 0.312$\pm$0.026 at Full), consistent with the finding that attack turns occupy ``benign'' embedding regions~\citep{bullwinkel2025repeng}.
50	MLM achieves mean F1 $\geq$ 0.97 at all prefixes $K \leq 5$ without any classification labels; domain exposure alone is sufficient.

6	DisPeD is a two-stage framework for multi-turn jailbreak detection. Stage~1 adapts a turn-level encoder through continued training on jailbreak conversation text. Stage~2 aggregates turn representations for conversation-level binary classification. To systematically identify what enables cross-attack generalization, we design seven Stage-1 variants that decompose the contributions of domain exposure, classification supervision, label quality, label granularity, and domain specificity. Figure~\ref{fig:architecture} illustrates the pipeline.

11	\caption{DisPeD architecture. Stage~1 adapts a DeBERTa encoder on jailbreak conversation text (seven variant objectives). Stage~2 aggregates frozen \texttt{[CLS]} embeddings via BiGRU for conversation-level jailbreak detection. Only user turns are processed.}
12	\label{fig:architecture}
13	\end{figure}
14	
15	\subsection{Problem Formulation}
16	
17	A conversation $C = \{u_1, a_1, \ldots, u_N, a_N\}$ alternates user turns $u_i$ and assistant responses $a_i$. Given a prefix of $K$ user turns, the model predicts $y \in \{0, 1\}$ (jailbreak vs.\ benign). We restrict input to user turns because adversarial intent resides in the attacker's messages. This formulation supports early detection from partial prefixes.
18	
19	\subsection{Stage 1: Turn-Level Encoder Adaptation}
20	\label{sec:stage1}
21	
22	Each user turn $u_i$ is encoded by DeBERTa-v3-base~\citep{he2021deberta}; the \texttt{[CLS]} embedding $h_i \in \mathbb{R}^d$ serves as the turn representation. Seven variants, summarized in Table~\ref{tab:variants}, share the same training data but differ in objective.
23	
24	\begin{table}[t]
25	\centering
26	\small
27	\caption{Stage-1 encoder variants. All operate on the same training conversations except Wikipedia MLM (matched token count on Wikipedia text).}
28	\label{tab:variants}
29	\begin{tabular}{@{}p{1.6cm}p{2.2cm}p{2.8cm}@{}}
30	\toprule
31	\textbf{Variant} & \textbf{Objective} & \textbf{Tests whether\ldots} \\
32	\midrule
33	9-class & 9-class persuasion + binary intent & full model \\
34	Binary & binary persuasion + binary intent & granularity matters \\
35	Scrambled & random 9-class + binary intent & label correctness matters \\
36	MLM-only & 15\% token masking & supervision is necessary \\
37	Topic & 5-class topic classif. & any task suffices \\
38	Wiki MLM & 15\% masking on Wikipedia & domain specificity matters \\
39	Vanilla & no training & Stage-2 alone suffices \\
40	\bottomrule
41	\end{tabular}
42	\end{table}
43	
44	The \textbf{9-class} variant uses two classification heads: 9-class persuasion strategy classification ($L_{\text{strategy}}$) and binary jailbreak intent ($L_{\text{intent}}$), with combined loss $L = L_{\text{strategy}} + \alpha \cdot L_{\text{intent}}$ ($\alpha = 0.3$). The taxonomy comprises eight persuasion strategies (rapport building, authority appeal, emotional manipulation, logical reframing, role assignment, gradual escalation, obfuscation, direct request) plus a none category, grounded in PAP~\citep{zeng2024pap} and Cialdini's principles~\citep{cialdini2001influence}. Strategy annotations are produced by Qwen3-8B with structured prompting that includes definitions and examples for each category; inter-annotator agreement between model annotations and a human sample ($n$=50) yields Cohen's $\kappa$=0.78.
45	
46	The remaining classification variants test specific ablation hypotheses.
47	The \textbf{binary} variant collapses the 9-class taxonomy into persuasive vs.\ non-persuasive, testing whether label granularity matters for detection or robustness.
48	The \textbf{scrambled} variant assigns random permutations of the 9-class labels to turns, preserving the classification structure (cross-entropy loss, 9-class output space) while destroying label semantics; this isolates whether the classification objective itself provides representational benefits independent of label correctness.
49	The \textbf{MLM-only} variant applies 15\% masked language modeling on the same jailbreak conversation text without any classification head, testing whether unsupervised domain exposure suffices.
50	The \textbf{topic} variant trains a 5-class topic classifier (technology, health, finance, education, general) on the same conversations, testing whether \emph{any} classification task provides the same benefit or whether task alignment matters.
51	The \textbf{Wikipedia MLM} variant applies the same MLM objective to a token-matched sample of Wikipedia text, isolating the effect of domain-specific vs.\ general continued pretraining.
52	The \textbf{vanilla} baseline uses the pretrained DeBERTa-v3-base weights without any continued training, measuring what Stage~2 alone can achieve.
53	
54	\subsection{Stage 2: Conversation-Level Classification}
55	\label{sec:stage2}
56	
57	Turn embeddings $\{h_1, \ldots, h_K\}$ from the frozen Stage-1 encoder are aggregated by a bidirectional GRU ($d_{\text{hidden}}$=128): $\bar{h} = [\overrightarrow{h_K};\; \overleftarrow{h_1}] \in \mathbb{R}^{256}$.
58	A two-layer MLP ($256 \to 64 \to 2$, ReLU activation, dropout 0.3) maps $\bar{h}$ to $\hat{y} \in \{0, 1\}$.
59	The Stage-1 encoder is frozen during Stage~2 training; only the BiGRU and MLP parameters are updated.
60	This separation ensures that the seven Stage-1 variants produce comparable embeddings evaluated under identical downstream conditions.
61	A preliminary comparison suggests that mean pooling approaches BiGRU performance (Section~\ref{sec:decomposition}), though multi-seed validation is needed.

3	\section{Related Work}
4	\label{sec:related_work}
5	
6	\paragraph{Multi-turn jailbreak attacks.}
7	Multi-turn attacks distribute adversarial intent across individually benign turns. Crescendo~\citep{russinovich2024crescendo} implements gradual escalation, FITD~\citep{fitd2024} exploits commitment-consistency bias, Deceptive Delight~\citep{deceptivedelight2024} combines emotional manipulation with role assignment, ActorAttack~\citep{ren2024actorattack} uses multi-persona steering, and PAIR~\citep{chao2023pair} automates iterative refinement. \citet{wei2023jailbroken} provide a unifying taxonomy grounded in competing objectives and mismatched generalization. Across these families, a shared reliance on persuasion dynamics~\citep{zeng2024pap,hagendorff2026reasoning,li2024mhj} distinguishes them from token-level attacks such as GCG~\citep{zou2023gcg}.
8	
9	\paragraph{Multi-turn defenses.}
10	Existing defenses model conversation-level structure but do not decompose what enables cross-attack generalization. DeepContext~\citep{deepcontext2026} combines fine-tuned BERT with a 3-layer GRU (hidden=2048) and achieves F1 = 0.84 on in-distribution data; however, its evaluation is limited to a single attack family and does not assess cross-dataset OOD transfer. BIID~\citep{tong2025biid} infers turn-level intentions, G-Guard~\citep{gguard2025} applies GNN classification, and SafeDream~\citep{safedream2026} predicts unsafe continuations. None of these systems evaluate generalization across attack families or analyze the mechanism that enables it. DisPeD's vanilla baseline represents the class of pretrained-encoder-plus-RNN approaches \emph{without} domain adaptation; it is not a direct proxy for DeepContext, which differs in encoder fine-tuning, model capacity, and loss function. Our contribution is the systematic decomposition showing that domain exposure, not architectural choices, is the primary factor for cross-attack generalization.
11	
12	\paragraph{Production safety systems.}
13	Per-turn classifiers (Llama Guard~\citep{inan2023llamaguard,metallamaguard3_2024}, ShieldGemma~\citep{zeng2024shieldgemma}, WildGuard~\citep{han2024wildguard}, Constitutional Classifiers~\citep{anthropic2025constitutional}) cannot model manipulation trajectories spanning multiple turns. LLM-as-judge approaches also fail: GPT-5.5 achieves F1 = 0.191--0.449 with 30--47\% unparseable responses (Appendix~\ref{sec:llm_judge}). DisPeD complements these systems as a conversation-level detection layer.
14	
15	\paragraph{Discourse analysis and computational persuasion.}
16	RST~\citep{mann1988rst}, PDTB~\citep{prasad2008pdtb}, and dialogue act taxonomies~\citep{stolcke2000dialogueact} model pragmatic structure. Speech Act Theory~\citep{austin1962speechacts,searle1969speechacts} distinguishes locutionary from illocutionary acts; existing jailbreak detectors operate at the locutionary level. PAP~\citep{zeng2024pap} identifies 40 persuasion techniques grounded in Cialdini's principles~\citep{cialdini2001influence}, and \citet{hagendorff2026reasoning} find identifiable strategies in 97\% of successful attacks. Related fine-grained persuasion detection work in propaganda analysis~\citep{dasanmartino2019fine,dasanmartino2020semeval} has shown that technique-level classification can capture manipulative intent in news text; DisPeD applies a similar taxonomy to conversational jailbreaks. DisPeD's detection operates through continued training rather than persuasion classification; the taxonomy provides interpretable characterization of known attack families (Section~\ref{sec:strategy}).
17	
18	\paragraph{Domain-adaptive pretraining.}
19	ULMFiT~\citep{howard2018ulmfit} established pretrain-then-fine-tune; \citet{gururangan2020dontstop} showed that continued pretraining on domain text yields consistent gains across domains. STILTs~\citep{phang2018stilts} and multi-task learning~\citep{caruana1997multitask,liu2019mtdnn} use intermediate tasks. DisPeD's MLM control confirms that continued pretraining bridges $\sim$60\,pp of the OOD gap on DeBERTa-v3 (MLM F1 $\geq$ 0.97 at $K \leq 5$). However, domain adaptation is universally beneficial across encoder architectures: RoBERTa~\citep{liu2019roberta} vanilla achieves F1 = 0.981 on structurally simple Deceptive Delight but collapses to 0.466 on ActorAttack~\citep{ren2024actorattack}; encoder pretraining method determines the difficulty threshold at which adaptation becomes critical (Section~\ref{sec:cross_encoder}). Classification supervision reduces cross-seed variance to near-zero in both architectures.
20	
21	\paragraph{Dataset artifacts and adversarial robustness.}
22	Classifiers are susceptible to spurious correlations~\citep{gururangan2018artifacts,niven2019probing}, and adaptive adversaries can bypass safety classifiers~\citep{nasr2025attackermovessecond,andriushchenko2024adaptive}. Adversarial NLP attacks such as TextFooler~\citep{jin2020textfooler} and BERT-Attack~\citep{li2020bertattack} demonstrate that neural text classifiers are vulnerable to token-level perturbations. TF-IDF achieves F1 = 0.944 on our OOD evaluation; this reveals lexical separability in current datasets. Probing classifiers~\citep{conneau2018probing,hewitt2019structural} could help determine whether DisPeD's representations encode discourse-level structure beyond lexical cues; we leave this for future work. DisPeD's demonstrated advantage is robustness under adversarial paraphrasing (0\,pp degradation for classification-supervised models vs.\ $\sim$12\,pp for non-adapted models).

DisPeD's MLM control confirms that continued pretraining bridges $\\sim$60\\,pp of the OOD gap on DeBERTa-v3 (MLM F1 $\\geq$ 0.97 at $K \\leq 5$). However, domain adaptation is universally beneficial across encoder architectures: RoBERTa~\\citep{liu2019roberta} vanilla achieves F1 = 0.981 on structurally simple Deceptive Delight but collapses to 0.466 on ActorAttack~\\citep{ren2024actorattack}; encoder pretraining method determines the difficulty threshold at which adaptation becomes critical (Section~\\ref{sec:cross_encoder}). Classification supervision reduces cross-seed variance to near-zero in both architectures.\n\n\\paragraph{Dataset artifacts and adversarial robustness.}\nClassifiers are susceptible to spurious correlations~\\citep{gururangan2018artifacts,niven2019probing}, and adaptive adversaries can bypass safety classifiers~\\citep{nasr2025attackermovessecond,andriushchenko2024adaptive}. Adversarial NLP attacks such as TextFooler~\\citep{jin2020textfooler} and BERT-Attack~\\citep{li2020bertattack} demonstrate that neural text classifiers are vulnerable to token-level perturbations. TF-IDF achieves F1 = 0.944 on our OOD evaluation; this reveals lexical separability in current datasets. Probing classifiers~\\citep{conneau2018probing,hewitt2019structural} could help determine whether DisPeD's representations encode discourse-level structure beyond lexical cues; we leave this for future work. DisPeD's demonstrated advantage is robustness under adversarial paraphrasing (0\\,pp degradation for classification-supervised models vs.\\ $\\sim$12\\,pp for non-adapted models).\n",

OK, lots of work. Let me now read the conclusion.tex and appendix.tex to have the full picture.

Let me also check what main.tex looks like to understand the paper structure (for checklist placement).

Let me prioritize and plan:

**P0 items:**
1. ARR Checklist - need to create a new .tex file
2. Delete all "preliminary" (7 occurrences found)
3. Reframe as Analysis Paper (Abstract + Introduction major rewrites)
6. W3 ActorAttack 118 in §4.1


4. Related Work cleanup
5. Abstract compression (part of #3)
7. Frozen encoder justification
8. W8/W9 confound discussion
9. Minor issues
10. Layout

I'll tackle the quick wins first—removing "preliminary" mentions, fixing the ActorAttack reference, justifying the frozen encoder, and addressing minor issues—then move into the heavier rewrites for the abstract, introduction, and related work sections.

Starting with the "preliminary" deletions: I need to replace the phrase in the abstract with "We present a systematic ablation on" and simplify the introduction's contribution statement by removing the qualifier entirely.

For the remaining occurrences, I'm checking the conclusion to see what context surrounds "preliminary evidence," then replacing "confirm this preliminary finding" with just "confirm this finding." In the experiments section, I'll change "This preliminary result suggests" to "This result suggests" and either cut or rephrase the sentence about treating results as preliminary. The method section needs "A preliminary comparison suggests" reworded to something like "A single-seed comparison suggests."

I also need to add the specific count of 118 to the ActorAttack citation in experiments.tex.

For the frozen encoder justification, the method section already explains that the Stage-1 encoder is frozen during Stage 2, so I should verify whether additional justification is needed or if the current explanation suffices.

Looking at the minor issues, I need to check terminology consistency between "domain exposure" and "continued pretraining," find where α=0.3 is mentioned and add brief justification, locate the FITD K values in the appendix and add a footnote, and track down those repeated "0.31→0.91" data points to see if they can be consolidated.

3	\section{Conclusion}
4	\label{sec:conclusion}
5	
6	DisPeD's controlled ablation across two encoder architectures and four attack families provides preliminary evidence that domain adaptation universally improves cross-attack generalization. On DeBERTa-v3, continued pretraining bridges $\sim$60\,pp of the OOD gap (vanilla 0.31$\pm$0.03 $\to$ MLM 0.91$\pm$0.12), with strong early detection (F1 $\geq$ 0.97 at $K \leq 5$). RoBERTa vanilla achieves F1\,=\,0.981 on structurally simple Deceptive Delight but collapses to 0.466 on multi-persona ActorAttack; classification-supervised RoBERTa recovers to F1\,=\,0.939 on ActorAttack. Encoder pretraining method determines the difficulty threshold at which adaptation becomes critical, not whether adaptation is needed. Across both encoders, classification supervision provides cross-seed stability (variance reduced 4--20$\times$ vs.\ MLM-only, consistent across DD and ActorAttack) and interpretable characterization of known attack families (though strategy predictions do not transfer to unseen attacks, OOD $\kappa$=0.126). Domain adaptation's detection advantage persists under adversarial paraphrasing (McNemar $p < 0.001$), though absolute perturbation robustness is attack-family-dependent (zero degradation on DD, domain-adapted variants degrading on ActorAttack). On structurally complex ActorAttack, all three classification-supervised variants remain equivalent (0.951--0.990), confirming that label quality is not a factor for detection at any OOD difficulty level. Validation on larger and more diverse datasets is needed.
7	
8	\section{Limitations}
9	\label{sec:limitations}
10	
11	\paragraph{Dataset scale and diversity.}
12	The training set contains 500 synthetic conversations generated by a single model (Qwen3-8B), and OOD evaluation covers three attack families (FITD, Deceptive Delight, ActorAttack). This scale limits statistical power: the perturbation evaluation ($n$=76) means tier boundaries in Table~\ref{tab:perturbation} correspond to 1--3 misclassifications. Whether the observed patterns generalize to human-generated attacks, additional attack families, or larger datasets remains an open question.
13	
14	\paragraph{Lexical separability.}
15	TF-IDF logistic regression achieves F1 = 0.944 on OOD Deceptive Delight without any neural representation learning. This strong bag-of-words baseline indicates substantial lexical separability in the current evaluation data. We cannot conclusively distinguish whether DisPeD's continued pretraining captures pragmatic discourse features or primarily exploits lexical cues that TF-IDF also captures. Probing experiments that test whether the learned representations encode discourse-level structure beyond lexical overlap are needed to resolve this question and are left for future work.
16	
17	\paragraph{Strategy annotation quality.}
18	Persuasion strategy labels are produced by Qwen3-8B with structured prompting. Inter-annotator agreement with a human sample ($n$=50) yields Cohen's $\kappa$=0.78, which indicates substantial but imperfect agreement. The small human validation sample and reliance on a single annotator model limit confidence in label quality. We plan to release the annotation prompts and data to enable independent verification.
19	
20	\paragraph{OOD strategy prediction.}
21	While the 9-class model achieves high detection F1 on OOD attacks (0.997$\pm$0.005 on Deceptive Delight), its strategy-level predictions do not generalize: OOD strategy accuracy is 30.7\% ($\kappa$=0.126). The interpretability provided by the persuasion taxonomy is currently limited to known attack families where strategy labels are reliable. This dissociation between detection generalization and strategy prediction generalization confirms that detection operates through domain-adapted representations rather than strategy classification accuracy.
22	
23	\paragraph{Single-seed variants.}
24	Mean pooling results report a single-seed (seed 42) evaluation. Multi-seed validation is needed to confirm this preliminary finding.
25	
26	\paragraph{Scope.}
27	Only persuasion-mediated multi-turn attacks fall within scope. Single-turn token-level attacks~\citep{zou2023gcg}, non-persuasive multi-turn strategies, and attacks targeting modalities other than text are not addressed. The user-only input assumption (excluding assistant responses) may miss information in attacks where the model's own responses contribute to the escalation trajectory.
28	
29	\paragraph{Computation cost.}
30	Stage~1 continued pretraining requires approximately 30 minutes on a single A100 GPU per variant. Stage~2 training completes in under 5 minutes. Total pipeline cost for all seven variants is under 4 GPU-hours, making the approach accessible for replication.

On DeBERTa-v3, continued pretraining bridges $\\sim$60\\,pp of the OOD gap (vanilla 0.31$\\pm$0.03 $\\to$ MLM 0.91$\\pm$0.12), with strong early detection (F1 $\\geq$ 0.97 at $K \\leq 5$). RoBERTa vanilla achieves F1\\,=\\,0.981 on structurally simple Deceptive Delight but collapses to 0.466 on multi-persona ActorAttack; classification-supervised RoBERTa recovers to F1\\,=\\,0.939 on ActorAttack. Encoder pretraining method determines the difficulty threshold at which adaptation becomes critical, not whether adaptation is needed. Across both encoders, classification supervision provides cross-seed stability (variance reduced 4--20$\\times$ vs.\\ MLM-only, consistent across DD and ActorAttack) and interpretable characterization of known attack families (though strategy predictions do not transfer to unseen attacks, OOD $\\kappa$=0.126). Domain adaptation's detection advantage persists under adversarial paraphrasing (McNemar $p < 0.001$), though absolute perturbation robustness is attack-family-dependent (zero degradation on DD, domain-adapted variants degrading on ActorAttack). On structurally complex ActorAttack, all three classification-supervised variants remain equivalent (0.951--0.990), confirming that label quality is not a factor for detection at any OOD difficulty level. Validation on larger and more diverse datasets is needed.\n\n\\section{Limitations}\n\\label{sec:limitations}\n\n\\paragraph{Dataset scale and diversity.}\nThe training set contains 500 synthetic conversations generated by a single model (Qwen3-8B), and OOD evaluation covers three attack families (FITD, Deceptive Delight, ActorAttack). This scale limits statistical power: the perturbation evaluation ($n$=76) means tier boundaries in Table~\\ref{tab:perturbation} correspond to 1--3 misclassifications. Whether the observed patterns generalize to human-generated attacks, additional attack families, or larger datasets remains an open question.\n\n\\paragraph{Lexical separability.}\nTF-IDF logistic regression achieves F1 = 0.944 on OOD Deceptive Delight without any neural representation learning. This strong bag-of-words baseline indicates substantial lexical separability in the current evaluation data. We cannot conclusively distinguish whether DisPeD's continued pretraining captures pragmatic discourse features or primarily exploits lexical cues that TF-IDF also captures. Probing experiments that test whether the learned representations encode discourse-level structure beyond lexical overlap are needed to resolve this question and are left for future work.\n\n\\paragraph{Strategy annotation quality.}\nPersuasion strategy labels are produced by Qwen3-8B with structured prompting. Inter-annotator agreement with a human sample ($n$=50) yields Cohen's $\\kappa$=0.78, which indicates substantial but imperfect agreement. The small human validation sample and reliance on a single annotator model limit confidence in label quality. We plan to release the annotation prompts and data to enable independent verification.\n\n\\paragraph{OOD strategy prediction.}\nWhile the 9-class model achieves high detection F1 on OOD attacks (0.997$\\pm$0.005 on Deceptive Delight), its strategy-level predictions do not generalize: OOD strategy accuracy is 30.7\\% ($\\kappa$=0.126). The interpretability provided by the persuasion taxonomy is currently limited to known attack families where strategy labels are reliable. This dissociation between detection generalization and strategy prediction generalization confirms that detection operates through domain-adapted representations rather than strategy classification accuracy.\n\n\\paragraph{Single-seed variants.}\nMean pooling results report a single-seed (seed 42) evaluation. Multi-seed validation is needed to confirm this preliminary finding.\n\n\\paragraph{Scope.}\nOnly persuasion-mediated multi-turn attacks fall within scope. Single-turn token-level attacks~\\citep{zou2023gcg}, non-persuasive multi-turn strategies, and attacks targeting modalities other than text are not addressed. The user-only input assumption (excluding assistant responses) may miss information in attacks where the model's own responses contribute to the escalation trajectory.\n\n\\paragraph{Computation cost.}\nStage~1 continued pretraining requires approximately 30 minutes on a single A100 GPU per variant. Stage~2 training completes in under 5 minutes. Total pipeline cost for all seven variants is under 4 GPU-hours, making the approach accessible for replication.\n",

33	Table~\ref{tab:llm_judge} reports zero-shot performance for GPT-5.5 and Qwen3-8B on IID and OOD data.
34	On IID Crescendo, GPT-5.5 achieves precision of 1.0 at all turn prefixes but recall ranges from only 0.105 to 0.290, resulting in F1 of 0.191 at $K$=2 and 0.449 at $K$=5.
35	A substantial fraction (30--47\%) of responses are unparseable; F1 values exclude these and represent upper bounds.
36	Full-conversation F1 (0.383) is lower than $K$=5 F1 (0.449) because the unparseable rate grows with context length.
37	Qwen3-8B performs worse across all IID prefixes (F1 from 0.000 at $K$=2 to 0.100 on full conversations).
38	On OOD data, Qwen3-8B predicts all conversations as benign (F1 = 0.0 on DD, F1 = 0.025 on FITD), while DisPeD maintains F1 $\geq$ 0.997 on DD and F1 = 1.000 on FITD.
39	The complete failure of content-level reasoning on unseen attack types underscores the necessity of trained discourse-aware classifiers.

129	\section{Reproducibility Details}
130	\label{sec:reproducibility}
131	
132	\paragraph{Stage-1 training.}
133	All variants use DeBERTa-v3-base (184M parameters) with learning rate $2 \times 10^{-5}$, AdamW optimizer ($\beta_1$=0.9, $\beta_2$=0.999, weight decay 0.01), linear warmup over the first 10\% of steps, batch size 16, and 4 epochs. MLM variants use 15\% random token masking. Training takes approximately 30 minutes per variant on a single NVIDIA A100 (40GB).
134	
135	\paragraph{Stage-2 training.}
136	The BiGRU has hidden dimension 128 (bidirectional, so output dimension 256). The MLP classifier has layers $256 \to 64 \to 2$ with ReLU activation and dropout 0.3. Training uses learning rate $1 \times 10^{-3}$, Adam optimizer, batch size 32, and 20 epochs with early stopping (patience 5) on validation F1. Stage-2 training completes in under 5 minutes per variant.
137	
138	\paragraph{Data generation.}
139	Jailbreak conversations are generated using Qwen3-8B with attack-specific prompt templates. Crescendo conversations follow a 5--8 turn gradual escalation structure. FITD conversations use a 2--3 turn commitment-consistency structure. Deceptive Delight conversations embed harmful content within emotionally engaging 3--5 turn sequences. Benign conversations are generated with topic-anchored prompts across five domains (technology, health, finance, education, general) with matched turn counts.
140	
141	\paragraph{Strategy annotation.}
142	Each user turn is annotated by Qwen3-8B using a structured prompt that provides definitions and two examples for each of the nine strategy categories. The prompt instructs the model to output a single category label. We plan to release all generation and annotation prompts, the full dataset, and training code upon acceptance.
143	
144	\paragraph{Adversarial paraphrasing.}
145	The paraphrased test set is generated by instructing Qwen3-8B to rephrase each user turn while preserving the communicative intent. The resulting paraphrases have mean BERTScore 0.92 and mean lexical overlap 0.20 with the originals. These metrics confirm substantial surface-level variation.

F1 values exclude these and represent upper bounds.\nFull-conversation F1 (0.383) is lower than $K$=5 F1 (0.449) because the unparseable rate grows with context length.\nQwen3-8B performs worse across all IID prefixes (F1 from 0.000 at $K$=2 to 0.100 on full conversations).\nOn OOD data, Qwen3-8B predicts all conversations as benign (F1 = 0.0 on DD, F1 = 0.025 on FITD), while DisPeD maintains F1 $\\geq$ 0.997 on DD and F1 = 1.000 on FITD.\nThe complete failure of content-level reasoning on unseen attack types underscores the necessity of trained discourse-aware classifiers.\n\n\\section{Full Cross-Attack Results by Prefix}\n\\label{sec:full_prefix}\n\n\\begin{table*}[t]\n\\centering\n\\small\n\\caption{Full cross-attack generalization results (F1) at all prefix lengths. 3-seed mean$\\pm$std where available.}\n\\label{tab:full_prefix}\n\\begin{tabular}{@{}lccccc@{}}\n\\toprule\n\\textbf{Method} & $K$=1 & $K$=2 & $K$=3 & $K$=5 & Full \\\\\n\\midrule\n\\multicolumn{6}{l}{\\textit{IID (Crescendo)}} \\\\[2pt]\n9-class (ours) & 1.000$\\pm$.000 & 1.000$\\pm$.000 & 1.000$\\pm$.000 & 1.000$\\pm$.000 & 1.000$\\pm$.000 \\\\\nMLM-only & .960 & .974 & .987 & 1.000 & 1.000 \\\\\nVanilla DeBERTa & .968$\\pm$.033 & .978$\\pm$.016 & .987$\\pm$.000 & .982$\\pm$.014 & 1.000$\\pm$.000 \\\\\nTF-IDF LR & 1.000 & 1.000 & 1.000 & 1.000 & 1.000 \\\\\n\\midrule\n\\multicolumn{6}{l}{\\textit{OOD (Deceptive Delight)}} \\\\[2pt]\n9-class (ours) & .990$\\pm$.013 & .981$\\pm$.013 & .972$\\pm$.026 & .997$\\pm$.005 & .997$\\pm$.005 \\\\\nBinary & .994$\\pm$.009 & .994$\\pm$.009 & .984$\\pm$.008 & 1.000$\\pm$.000 & .997$\\pm$.005 \\\\\nScrambled & .997$\\pm$.005 & .981$\\pm$.026 & .975$\\pm$.029 & .997$\\pm$.005 & .997$\\pm$.005 \\\\\nMLM-only & .973$\\pm$.019 & .993$\\pm$.009 & .997$\\pm$.005 & .997$\\pm$.005 & .914$\\pm$.115 \\\\\nVanilla DeBERTa & .628$\\pm$.038 & .479$\\pm$.038 & .389$\\pm$.027 & .351$\\pm$.030 & .312$\\pm$.026 \\\\\nTF-IDF LR & -- & -- & -- & -- & .944 \\\\\n\\midrule\n\\multicolumn{6}{l}{\\textit{OOD (FITD)}} \\\\[2pt]\n9-class (ours) & 1.000 & 1.000 & -- & -- & 1.000 \\\\\nVanilla DeBERTa & .990 & 1.000 & -- & -- & 1.000 \\\\\nTF-IDF LR & 1.000 & -- & -- & -- & 1.000 \\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{table*}\n\n\\section{ActorAttack Full Results}\n\\label{sec:actorattack_full}\n\n\\begin{table*}[t]\n\\centering\n\\small\n\\caption{Full ActorAttack OOD results (F1) at all prefix lengths. 3-seed mean$\\pm$std (Binary per-$K$ reports $n$=2;

MLM variants use 15\\% random token masking. Training takes approximately 30 minutes per variant on a single NVIDIA A100 (40GB).\n\n\\paragraph{Stage-2 training.}\nThe BiGRU has hidden dimension 128 (bidirectional, so output dimension 256). The MLP classifier has layers $256 \\to 64 \\to 2$ with ReLU activation and dropout 0.3. Training uses learning rate $1 \\times 10^{-3}$, Adam optimizer, batch size 32, and 20 epochs with early stopping (patience 5) on validation F1. Stage-2 training completes in under 5 minutes per variant.\n\n\\paragraph{Data generation.}\nJailbreak conversations are generated using Qwen3-8B with attack-specific prompt templates. Crescendo conversations follow a 5--8 turn gradual escalation structure. FITD conversations use a 2--3 turn commitment-consistency structure. Deceptive Delight conversations embed harmful content within emotionally engaging 3--5 turn sequences. Benign conversations are generated with topic-anchored prompts across five domains (technology, health, finance, education, general) with matched turn counts.\n\n\\paragraph{Strategy annotation.}\nEach user turn is annotated by Qwen3-8B using a structured prompt that provides definitions and two examples for each of the nine strategy categories. The prompt instructs the model to output a single category label. We plan to release all generation and annotation prompts, the full dataset, and training code upon acceptance.\n\n\\paragraph{Adversarial paraphrasing.}\nThe paraphrased test set is generated by instructing Qwen3-8B to rephrase each user turn while preserving the communicative intent. The resulting paraphrases have mean BERTScore 0.92 and mean lexical overlap 0.20 with the originals. These metrics confirm substantial surface-level variation.\n",

Now I have the full picture. Let me also read main.tex to understand the paper structure for checklist placement.

Let me plan and execute this in phases. Given the scale, I'll work through items systematically.

Let me start with the quick mechanical fixes first:

**Phase 1: Quick fixes (items 2, 6, 9-minor)**
- Delete "preliminary" (7 occurrences)
- Add ActorAttack 118 to §4.1
- α=0.3 justification
- FITD -- explanation
- "0.31→0.91" repetition reduction


- **Phase 2: Method + frozen encoder (item 7)**
- **Phase 3: Related Work cleanup (item 4)**
- **Phase 4: Abstract + Introduction rewrite (items 3, 5)**
- **Phase 5: Discussion paragraphs (item 8)**
- **Phase 6: ARR Checklist (item 1)**
- **Phase 7: Layout check (item 10)**

Let me start Phase 1 now. I'll batch the "preliminary" deletions.

OK, now I have the full picture. Let me start executing.

**Phase 1: Quick mechanical fixes**

Let me batch all the "preliminary" deletions and other quick fixes.

1. abstract.tex L4: "We present preliminary findings from a systematic ablation" → "We present a systematic ablation"
2. introduction.tex L16: "Our contributions on this preliminary study of synthetic multi-turn jailbreak conversations:" → "Our contributions:"
3. conclusion.tex L6: "provides preliminary evidence that" → "provides evidence that"
4. conclusion.tex L24: "to confirm this preliminary finding" → "to confirm this finding"


5. experiments.tex L135: "This preliminary result suggests" → "This result suggests"
6. experiments.tex L136: "the conclusion should be treated as preliminary" → "the conclusion requires multi-seed confirmation"
7. method.tex L61: "A preliminary comparison suggests" → "A single-seed comparison suggests"

I also need to add "118" before ActorAttack in experiments.tex L11 and include the α=0.3 justification in method.tex L44. Since these are scattered across different files with unique strings, I can handle them all in parallel.

Stage~1 adapts a turn-level encoder through continued training on jailbreak conversation text. Stage~2 aggregates turn representations for conversation-level binary classification. To systematically identify what enables cross-attack generalization, we design seven Stage-1 variants that decompose the contributions of domain exposure, classification supervision, label quality, label granularity, and domain specificity. Figure~\\ref{fig:architecture} illustrates the pipeline.\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{figures/paper/fig1_architecture.pdf}\n\\caption{DisPeD architecture. Stage~1 adapts a DeBERTa encoder on jailbreak conversation text (seven variant objectives). Stage~2 aggregates frozen \\texttt{[CLS]} embeddings via BiGRU for conversation-level jailbreak detection. Only user turns are processed.}\n\\label{fig:architecture}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\subsection{Problem Formulation}\n\nA conversation $C = \\{u_1, a_1, \\ldots, u_N, a_N\\}$ alternates user turns $u_i$ and assistant responses $a_i$. Given a prefix of $K$ user turns, the model predicts $y \\in \\{0, 1\\}$ (jailbreak vs.\\ benign). We restrict input to user turns because adversarial intent resides in the attacker's messages. This formulation supports early detection from partial prefixes.\n\n\\subsection{Stage 1: Turn-Level Encoder Adaptation}\n\\label{sec:stage1}\n\nEach user turn $u_i$ is encoded by DeBERTa-v3-base~\\citep{he2021deberta}; the \\texttt{[CLS]} embedding $h_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ serves as the turn representation. Seven variants, summarized in Table~\\ref{tab:variants}, share the same training data but differ in objective.\n\n\\begin{table}[t]\n\\centering\n\\small\n\\caption{Stage-1 encoder variants. All operate on the same training conversations except Wikipedia MLM (matched token count on Wikipedia text).}\n\\label{tab:variants}\n\\begin{tabular}{@{}p{1.6cm}p{2.2cm}p{2.8cm}@{}}\n\\toprule\n\\textbf{Variant} & \\textbf{Objective} & \\textbf{Tests whether\\ldots} \\\\\n\\midrule\n9-class & 9-class persuasion + binary intent & full model \\\\\nBinary & binary persuasion + binary intent & granularity matters \\\\\nScrambled & random 9-class + binary intent & label correctness matters \\\\\nMLM-only & 15\\% token masking & supervision is necessary \\\\\nTopic & 5-class topic classif. & any task suffices \\\\\nWiki MLM & 15\\% masking on Wikipedia & domain specificity matters \\\\\nVanilla & no training & Stage-2 alone suffices \\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\n\nThe \\textbf{9-class} variant uses two classification heads: 9-class persuasion strategy classification ($L_{\\text{strategy}}$) and binary jailbreak intent ($L_{\\text{intent}}$), with combined loss $L = L_{\\text{strategy}} + \\alpha \\cdot L_{\\text{intent}}$ ($\\alpha = 0.3$). The taxonomy comprises eight persuasion strategies (rapport building, authority appeal, emotional manipulation, logical reframing, role assignment, gradual escalation, obfuscation, direct request) plus a none category, grounded in PAP~\\citep{zeng2024pap} and Cialdini's principles~\\citep{cialdini2001influence}. Strategy annotations are produced by Qwen3-8B with structured prompting that includes definitions and examples for each category; inter-annotator agreement between model annotations and a human sample ($n$=50) yields Cohen's $\\kappa$=0.78.\n\nThe remaining classification variants test specific ablation hypotheses.\nThe \\textbf{binary} variant collapses the 9-class taxonomy into persuasive vs.\\ non-persuasive, testing whether label granularity matters for detection or robustness.\nThe \\textbf{scrambled} variant assigns random permutations of the 9-class labels to turns, preserving the classification structure (cross-entropy loss, 9-class output space) while destroying label semantics; this isolates whether the classification objective itself provides representational benefits independent of label correctness.\nThe \\textbf{MLM-only} variant applies 15\\% masked language modeling on the same jailbreak conversation text without any classification head, testing whether unsupervised domain exposure suffices.\nThe \\textbf{topic} variant trains a 5-class topic classifier (technology, health, finance, education, general) on the same conversations, testing whether \\emph{any} classification task provides the same benefit or whether task alignment matters.\nThe \\textbf{Wikipedia MLM} variant applies the same MLM objective to a token-matched sample of Wikipedia text, isolating the effect of domain-specific vs.\\ general continued pretraining.\nThe \\textbf{vanilla} baseline uses the pretrained DeBERTa-v3-base weights without any continued training, measuring what Stage~2 alone can achieve.\n\n\\subsection{Stage 2: Conversation-Level Classification}\n\\label{sec:stage2}\n\nTurn embeddings $\\{h_1, \\ldots, h_K\\}$ from the frozen Stage-1 encoder are aggregated by a bidirectional GRU ($d_{\\text{hidden}}$=128): $\\bar{h} = [\\overrightarrow{h_K};\\; \\overleftarrow{h_1}] \\in \\mathbb{R}^{256}$.\nA two-layer MLP ($256 \\to 64 \\to 2$, ReLU activation, dropout 0.3) maps $\\bar{h}$ to $\\hat{y} \\in \\{0, 1\\}$.\nThe Stage-1 encoder is frozen during Stage~2 training; only the BiGRU and MLP parameters are updated.\nThis separation ensures that the seven Stage-1 variants produce comparable embeddings evaluated under identical downstream conditions.\nA preliminary comparison suggests that mean pooling approaches BiGRU performance (Section~\\ref{sec:decomposition}), though multi-seed validation is needed.\n",

Attacks such as Crescendo~\\citep{russinovich2024crescendo}, Foot-in-the-Door (FITD)~\\citep{fitd2024}, and Deceptive Delight~\\citep{deceptivedelight2024} distribute adversarial intent across individually benign turns through rapport building, logical reframing, and incremental escalation. Persuasion is the common mechanism: \\citet{zeng2024pap} catalogue 40 persuasion techniques across jailbreak families, and \\citet{hagendorff2026reasoning} find identifiable strategies in 97\\% of successful attacks. Individual attack turns occupy the same embedding region as benign text~\\citep{bullwinkel2025repeng}, rendering per-turn safety filters fundamentally blind.\n\nProduction classifiers such as Llama Guard~\\citep{inan2023llamaguard}, WildGuard~\\citep{han2024wildguard}, and ShieldGemma~\\citep{zeng2024shieldgemma} operate on individual turns and cannot model manipulation trajectories across exchanges. Recent multi-turn defenses have begun to address conversation-level structure: DeepContext~\\citep{deepcontext2026} combines fine-tuned BERT with a multi-layer GRU, BIID~\\citep{tong2025biid} infers turn-level intentions, and G-Guard~\\citep{gguard2025} applies graph neural networks. These systems achieve reasonable in-distribution performance but are evaluated on single attack families and do not assess cross-dataset OOD transfer. None systematically analyze \\emph{why} some representations generalize while others fail. The open question is: \\emph{what representation properties enable cross-attack generalization?}\n\nA vanilla DeBERTa encoder~\\citep{he2021deberta} with temporal aggregation collapses from F1\\,=\\,1.000 on in-distribution data to F1\\,=\\,0.312$\\pm$0.026 on out-of-distribution (OOD) Deceptive Delight, worsening with more turns (0.628 at turn~1 to 0.312 at full conversation). LLM-as-judge approaches fare no better: GPT-5.5 achieves F1 of only 0.191--0.449 on in-distribution detection with 30--47\\% unparseable responses (Appendix~\\ref{sec:llm_judge}). Content-level reasoning is insufficient for this task.\n\nWe built \\textbf{DisPeD} (Discourse-level Persuasion Detection), a two-stage framework with seven controlled Stage~1 variants that systematically decompose the mechanism: 9-class persuasion strategy classification, binary classification, scrambled labels, MLM only, topic classification, Wikipedia MLM, and vanilla control (Section~\\ref{sec:method}). Each variant isolates a specific factor (domain exposure, classification supervision, label quality, label granularity, or domain specificity) while holding all other components constant.\n\nThrough this systematic ablation on DeBERTa-v3, we find that domain exposure via continued pretraining bridges $\\sim$60 percentage points (pp) of the OOD gap (vanilla 0.31$\\pm$0.03 $\\to$ MLM 0.91$\\pm$0.12), with strong early detection on unseen Deceptive Delight (mean F1\\,$\\geq$\\,0.97 at $K \\leq 5$). Classification supervision provides complementary stability: the 9-class model achieves F1\\,=\\,0.997$\\pm$0.005 with near-zero variance at full conversation length. Cross-encoder validation on RoBERTa~\\citep{liu2019roberta} shows that domain adaptation is universally beneficial: RoBERTa vanilla achieves F1\\,=\\,0.981 on Deceptive Delight but collapses to 0.466$\\pm$0.163 on structurally distinct ActorAttack~\\citep{ren2024actorattack}, while classification-supervised variants maintain F1\\,$\\geq$\\,0.93 on both. Encoder pretraining method determines the difficulty threshold at which adaptation becomes critical: DeBERTa-v3's replaced token detection (RTD)~\\citep{he2021deberta} requires adaptation even for simple attacks, while RoBERTa's standard MLM pretraining tolerates simple attacks but fails on structurally complex ones. Across both encoders, classification supervision reduces cross-seed variance to 0.005--0.046.\n\nOur contributions on this preliminary study of synthetic multi-turn jailbreak conversations:\n\\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*, itemsep=2pt, topsep=4pt]\n  \\item \\textbf{Systematic decomposition.} Seven controlled DeBERTa-v3 variants identify continued pretraining as the primary mechanism for cross-attack generalization on this encoder ($\\sim$60\\,pp OOD gap bridged by MLM alone). Misaligned supervision (topic classification) actively destabilizes representations.\n\n  \\item \\textbf{Cross-encoder validation.} Domain adaptation is universally beneficial: RoBERTa vanilla achieves F1\\,=\\,0.981 on Deceptive Delight but collapses to 0.466 on ActorAttack. Encoder pretraining method determines the difficulty threshold at which adaptation becomes critical (Section~\\ref{sec:cross_encoder}).\n\n  \\item \\textbf{Cross-seed stability.} Classification supervision reduces cross-seed variance 4--20$\\times$ compared to MLM-only pretraining (9-class std\\,=\\,0.005 on DD, 0.026 on ActorAttack vs.\\ MLM std\\,=\\,0.115, 0.080), consistent across both OOD families. The 9-class taxonomy additionally provides interpretable characterization of known attack families, though strategy predictions do not transfer to unseen attacks (Section~\\ref{sec:strategy}).\n\n\\end{itemize}\n",

On DeBERTa-v3, continued pretraining bridges $\\sim$60\\,pp of the OOD gap (vanilla 0.31$\\pm$0.03 $\\to$ MLM 0.91$\\pm$0.12), with strong early detection (F1 $\\geq$ 0.97 at $K \\leq 5$). RoBERTa vanilla achieves F1\\,=\\,0.981 on structurally simple Deceptive Delight but collapses to 0.466 on multi-persona ActorAttack; classification-supervised RoBERTa recovers to F1\\,=\\,0.939 on ActorAttack. Encoder pretraining method determines the difficulty threshold at which adaptation becomes critical, not whether adaptation is needed. Across both encoders, classification supervision provides cross-seed stability (variance reduced 4--20$\\times$ vs.\\ MLM-only, consistent across DD and ActorAttack) and interpretable characterization of known attack families (though strategy predictions do not transfer to unseen attacks, OOD $\\kappa$=0.126). Domain adaptation's detection advantage persists under adversarial paraphrasing (McNemar $p < 0.001$), though absolute perturbation robustness is attack-family-dependent (zero degradation on DD, domain-adapted variants degrading on ActorAttack). On structurally complex ActorAttack, all three classification-supervised variants remain equivalent (0.951--0.990), confirming that label quality is not a factor for detection at any OOD difficulty level. Validation on larger and more diverse datasets is needed.\n\n\\section{Limitations}\n\\label{sec:limitations}\n\n\\paragraph{Dataset scale and diversity.}\nThe training set contains 500 synthetic conversations generated by a single model (Qwen3-8B), and OOD evaluation covers three attack families (FITD, Deceptive Delight, ActorAttack). This scale limits statistical power: the perturbation evaluation ($n$=76) means tier boundaries in Table~\\ref{tab:perturbation} correspond to 1--3 misclassifications. Whether the observed patterns generalize to human-generated attacks, additional attack families, or larger datasets remains an open question.\n\n\\paragraph{Lexical separability.}\nTF-IDF logistic regression achieves F1 = 0.944 on OOD Deceptive Delight without any neural representation learning. This strong bag-of-words baseline indicates substantial lexical separability in the current evaluation data. We cannot conclusively distinguish whether DisPeD's continued pretraining captures pragmatic discourse features or primarily exploits lexical cues that TF-IDF also captures. Probing experiments that test whether the learned representations encode discourse-level structure beyond lexical overlap are needed to resolve this question and are left for future work.\n\n\\paragraph{Strategy annotation quality.}\nPersuasion strategy labels are produced by Qwen3-8B with structured prompting. Inter-annotator agreement with a human sample ($n$=50) yields Cohen's $\\kappa$=0.78, which indicates substantial but imperfect agreement. The small human validation sample and reliance on a single annotator model limit confidence in label quality. We plan to release the annotation prompts and data to enable independent verification.\n\n\\paragraph{OOD strategy prediction.}\nWhile the 9-class model achieves high detection F1 on OOD attacks (0.997$\\pm$0.005 on Deceptive Delight), its strategy-level predictions do not generalize: OOD strategy accuracy is 30.7\\% ($\\kappa$=0.126). The interpretability provided by the persuasion taxonomy is currently limited to known attack families where strategy labels are reliable. This dissociation between detection generalization and strategy prediction generalization confirms that detection operates through domain-adapted representations rather than strategy classification accuracy.\n\n\\paragraph{Single-seed variants.}\nMean pooling results report a single-seed (seed 42) evaluation. Multi-seed validation is needed to confirm this preliminary finding.\n\n\\paragraph{Scope.}\nOnly persuasion-mediated multi-turn attacks fall within scope. Single-turn token-level attacks~\\citep{zou2023gcg}, non-persuasive multi-turn strategies, and attacks targeting modalities other than text are not addressed. The user-only input assumption (excluding assistant responses) may miss information in attacks where the model's own responses contribute to the escalation trajectory.\n\n\\paragraph{Computation cost.}\nStage~1 continued pretraining requires approximately 30 minutes on a single A100 GPU per variant. Stage~2 training completes in under 5 minutes. Total pipeline cost for all seven variants is under 4 GPU-hours, making the approach accessible for replication.\n",

On DeBERTa-v3, continued pretraining bridges $\\sim$60\\,pp of the OOD gap (vanilla 0.31$\\pm$0.03 $\\to$ MLM 0.91$\\pm$0.12), with strong early detection (F1 $\\geq$ 0.97 at $K \\leq 5$). RoBERTa vanilla achieves F1\\,=\\,0.981 on structurally simple Deceptive Delight but collapses to 0.466 on multi-persona ActorAttack; classification-supervised RoBERTa recovers to F1\\,=\\,0.939 on ActorAttack. Encoder pretraining method determines the difficulty threshold at which adaptation becomes critical, not whether adaptation is needed. Across both encoders, classification supervision provides cross-seed stability (variance reduced 4--20$\\times$ vs.\\ MLM-only, consistent across DD and ActorAttack) and interpretable characterization of known attack families (though strategy predictions do not transfer to unseen attacks, OOD $\\kappa$=0.126). Domain adaptation's detection advantage persists under adversarial paraphrasing (McNemar $p < 0.001$), though absolute perturbation robustness is attack-family-dependent (zero degradation on DD, domain-adapted variants degrading on ActorAttack). On structurally complex ActorAttack, all three classification-supervised variants remain equivalent (0.951--0.990), confirming that label quality is not a factor for detection at any OOD difficulty level. Validation on larger and more diverse datasets is needed.\n\n\\section{Limitations}\n\\label{sec:limitations}\n\n\\paragraph{Dataset scale and diversity.}\nThe training set contains 500 synthetic conversations generated by a single model (Qwen3-8B), and OOD evaluation covers three attack families (FITD, Deceptive Delight, ActorAttack). This scale limits statistical power: the perturbation evaluation ($n$=76) means tier boundaries in Table~\\ref{tab:perturbation} correspond to 1--3 misclassifications. Whether the observed patterns generalize to human-generated attacks, additional attack families, or larger datasets remains an open question.\n\n\\paragraph{Lexical separability.}\nTF-IDF logistic regression achieves F1 = 0.944 on OOD Deceptive Delight without any neural representation learning. This strong bag-of-words baseline indicates substantial lexical separability in the current evaluation data. We cannot conclusively distinguish whether DisPeD's continued pretraining captures pragmatic discourse features or primarily exploits lexical cues that TF-IDF also captures. Probing experiments that test whether the learned representations encode discourse-level structure beyond lexical overlap are needed to resolve this question and are left for future work.\n\n\\paragraph{Strategy annotation quality.}\nPersuasion strategy labels are produced by Qwen3-8B with structured prompting. Inter-annotator agreement with a human sample ($n$=50) yields Cohen's $\\kappa$=0.78, which indicates substantial but imperfect agreement. The small human validation sample and reliance on a single annotator model limit confidence in label quality. We plan to release the annotation prompts and data to enable independent verification.\n\n\\paragraph{OOD strategy prediction.}\nWhile the 9-class model achieves high detection F1 on OOD attacks (0.997$\\pm$0.005 on Deceptive Delight), its strategy-level predictions do not generalize: OOD strategy accuracy is 30.7\\% ($\\kappa$=0.126). The interpretability provided by the persuasion taxonomy is currently limited to known attack families where strategy labels are reliable. This dissociation between detection generalization and strategy prediction generalization confirms that detection operates through domain-adapted representations rather than strategy classification accuracy.\n\n\\paragraph{Single-seed variants.}\nMean pooling results report a single-seed (seed 42) evaluation. Multi-seed validation is needed to confirm this preliminary finding.\n\n\\paragraph{Scope.}\nOnly persuasion-mediated multi-turn attacks fall within scope. Single-turn token-level attacks~\\citep{zou2023gcg}, non-persuasive multi-turn strategies, and attacks targeting modalities other than text are not addressed. The user-only input assumption (excluding assistant responses) may miss information in attacks where the model's own responses contribute to the escalation trajectory.\n\n\\paragraph{Computation cost.}\nStage~1 continued pretraining requires approximately 30 minutes on a single A100 GPU per variant. Stage~2 training completes in under 5 minutes. Total pipeline cost for all seven variants is under 4 GPU-hours, making the approach accessible for replication.\n",

Stage~1 adapts a turn-level encoder through continued training on jailbreak conversation text. Stage~2 aggregates turn representations for conversation-level binary classification. To systematically identify what enables cross-attack generalization, we design seven Stage-1 variants that decompose the contributions of domain exposure, classification supervision, label quality, label granularity, and domain specificity. Figure~\\ref{fig:architecture} illustrates the pipeline.\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{figures/paper/fig1_architecture.pdf}\n\\caption{DisPeD architecture. Stage~1 adapts a DeBERTa encoder on jailbreak conversation text (seven variant objectives). Stage~2 aggregates frozen \\texttt{[CLS]} embeddings via BiGRU for conversation-level jailbreak detection. Only user turns are processed.}\n\\label{fig:architecture}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\subsection{Problem Formulation}\n\nA conversation $C = \\{u_1, a_1, \\ldots, u_N, a_N\\}$ alternates user turns $u_i$ and assistant responses $a_i$. Given a prefix of $K$ user turns, the model predicts $y \\in \\{0, 1\\}$ (jailbreak vs.\\ benign). We restrict input to user turns because adversarial intent resides in the attacker's messages. This formulation supports early detection from partial prefixes.\n\n\\subsection{Stage 1: Turn-Level Encoder Adaptation}\n\\label{sec:stage1}\n\nEach user turn $u_i$ is encoded by DeBERTa-v3-base~\\citep{he2021deberta}; the \\texttt{[CLS]} embedding $h_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ serves as the turn representation. Seven variants, summarized in Table~\\ref{tab:variants}, share the same training data but differ in objective.\n\n\\begin{table}[t]\n\\centering\n\\small\n\\caption{Stage-1 encoder variants. All operate on the same training conversations except Wikipedia MLM (matched token count on Wikipedia text).}\n\\label{tab:variants}\n\\begin{tabular}{@{}p{1.6cm}p{2.2cm}p{2.8cm}@{}}\n\\toprule\n\\textbf{Variant} & \\textbf{Objective} & \\textbf{Tests whether\\ldots} \\\\\n\\midrule\n9-class & 9-class persuasion + binary intent & full model \\\\\nBinary & binary persuasion + binary intent & granularity matters \\\\\nScrambled & random 9-class + binary intent & label correctness matters \\\\\nMLM-only & 15\\% token masking & supervision is necessary \\\\\nTopic & 5-class topic classif. & any task suffices \\\\\nWiki MLM & 15\\% masking on Wikipedia & domain specificity matters \\\\\nVanilla & no training & Stage-2 alone suffices \\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\n\nThe \\textbf{9-class} variant uses two classification heads: 9-class persuasion strategy classification ($L_{\\text{strategy}}$) and binary jailbreak intent ($L_{\\text{intent}}$), with combined loss $L = L_{\\text{strategy}} + \\alpha \\cdot L_{\\text{intent}}$ ($\\alpha = 0.3$, selected from $\\{0, 0.3, 0.5, 2.0\\}$; all values yield F1\\,=\\,1.0 on IID). The taxonomy comprises eight persuasion strategies (rapport building, authority appeal, emotional manipulation, logical reframing, role assignment, gradual escalation, obfuscation, direct request) plus a none category, grounded in PAP~\\citep{zeng2024pap} and Cialdini's principles~\\citep{cialdini2001influence}. Strategy annotations are produced by Qwen3-8B with structured prompting that includes definitions and examples for each category; inter-annotator agreement between model annotations and a human sample ($n$=50) yields Cohen's $\\kappa$=0.78.\n\nThe remaining classification variants test specific ablation hypotheses.\nThe \\textbf{binary} variant collapses the 9-class taxonomy into persuasive vs.\\ non-persuasive, testing whether label granularity matters for detection or robustness.\nThe \\textbf{scrambled} variant assigns random permutations of the 9-class labels to turns, preserving the classification structure (cross-entropy loss, 9-class output space) while destroying label semantics; this isolates whether the classification objective itself provides representational benefits independent of label correctness.\nThe \\textbf{MLM-only} variant applies 15\\% masked language modeling on the same jailbreak conversation text without any classification head, testing whether unsupervised domain exposure suffices.\nThe \\textbf{topic} variant trains a 5-class topic classifier (technology, health, finance, education, general) on the same conversations, testing whether \\emph{any} classification task provides the same benefit or whether task alignment matters.\nThe \\textbf{Wikipedia MLM} variant applies the same MLM objective to a token-matched sample of Wikipedia text, isolating the effect of domain-specific vs.\\ general continued pretraining.\nThe \\textbf{vanilla} baseline uses the pretrained DeBERTa-v3-base weights without any continued training, measuring what Stage~2 alone can achieve.\n\n\\subsection{Stage 2: Conversation-Level Classification}\n\\label{sec:stage2}\n\nTurn embeddings $\\{h_1, \\ldots, h_K\\}$ from the frozen Stage-1 encoder are aggregated by a bidirectional GRU ($d_{\\text{hidden}}$=128): $\\bar{h} = [\\overrightarrow{h_K};\\; \\overleftarrow{h_1}] \\in \\mathbb{R}^{256}$.\nA two-layer MLP ($256 \\to 64 \\to 2$, ReLU activation, dropout 0.3) maps $\\bar{h}$ to $\\hat{y} \\in \\{0, 1\\}$.\nThe Stage-1 encoder is frozen during Stage~2 training; only the BiGRU and MLP parameters are updated.\nThis separation ensures that the seven Stage-1 variants produce comparable embeddings evaluated under identical downstream conditions.\nA single-seed comparison suggests that mean pooling approaches BiGRU performance (Section~\\ref{sec:decomposition}), though multi-seed validation is needed.\n",
