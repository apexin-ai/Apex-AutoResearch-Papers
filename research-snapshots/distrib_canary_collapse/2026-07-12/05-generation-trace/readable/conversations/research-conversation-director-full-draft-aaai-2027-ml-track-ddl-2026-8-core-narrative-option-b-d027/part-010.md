    "originalFile": "\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{sec:introduction}\n\nTraining language models on their own output across successive generations leads to progressive distribution degradation, a phenomenon variously termed model collapse~\\cite{shumailov2024curse} or Model Autophagy Disorder~\\cite{alemohammad2024mad}.\nTail modes vanish, lexical diversity narrows, and calibration deteriorates as each generation's output becomes the next generation's training data.\nAs large language models become ubiquitous content generators, the fraction of machine-generated text on the web grows steadily, making iterative training collapse---where models are unwittingly trained on the output of earlier model generations---a practical concern for the long-term stability of language model ecosystems.\n\nA natural follow-up question is whether cheap-to-compute statistics---\\emph{canary metrics}---can provide early warning of impending collapse, analogous to early-warning signals for critical transitions in ecological and climate systems~\\cite{scheffer2009early,scheffer2012anticipating}.\nSeveral recent studies have pursued this direction: \\citet{du2026geometric} informally observe that expected calibration error rises before accuracy degrades; SIGMA~\\cite{sigma2026spectral} proposes spectral indicators of distributional shift; and DCES~\\cite{dces2026counter} uses center-edge sampling dynamics as a collapse signal.\nYet the statistical methodology underlying these lead-lag claims---whether a canary metric genuinely \\emph{precedes} downstream degradation, or merely correlates with it under shared non-stationary trends---has received little scrutiny.\n\nWe identify several methodological deficiencies that pervade existing lead-lag analyses of iterative training collapse:\n(1)~no differencing tests to rule out spurious regression arising from shared non-stationary trends---a well-known hazard when correlating co-trending time series;\n(2)~no multi-method cross-validation---conclusions rest on a single statistical method whose implicit assumptions about stationarity and directionality are rarely examined;\n(3)~no multiple comparison correction (e.g., Benjamini--Hochberg FDR control), increasing the risk of false discoveries when testing many metric pairs simultaneously; and\n(4)~no regime-dependent analysis, despite the possibility that the same statistical test yields opposite conclusions at different contamination levels.\nThe closest predecessor is \\citet{du2026geometric}, who observe that calibration error rises before accuracy degrades in iteratively trained language models.\nTheir analysis, however, is limited to a single metric pair, spans only 1--3 generations, and reports informal visual comparisons without statistical tests---leaving open the question of whether the observed lead is genuine or an artifact of shared trends.\nThe early-warning framework of \\citet{scheffer2009early,scheffer2012anticipating}---widely adopted in ecology for anticipating tipping points---provides the theoretical motivation for canary-based prediction, but has not been systematically applied to iterative training collapse with the methodological rigor that short, noisy time series demand~\\cite{boettiger2012limits}.\n\nWe address these gaps through a systematic case study of canary prediction of diversity collapse---the progressive loss of lexical diversity in model-generated text across training generations.\nUsing Pythia-410M across five contamination levels ($\\alpha \\in \\{0.00, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1.00\\}$) and up to four random seeds, we expose three methodological pitfalls that undermine naive lead-lag analysis:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item \\textbf{Method sensitivity.} Applied to the same data (16 candidate canary$\\to$downstream pairs, including candidates later excluded; \\S\\ref{sec:case_study}), five lead-lag detection methods yield FDR significance rates ranging from 100\\% (naive cross-correlation) to 25\\% (Toda--Yamamoto Granger causality), with inter-method agreement of Cohen's $\\kappa{=}0.185$ (poor agreement).\n    \\item \\textbf{Spurious regression.} Canary$\\to$perplexity associations appear near-universal in undifferenced analysis but vanish entirely after first-differencing ($F{\\approx}0$, $p{=}0.99$), revealing them as artifacts of co-trending rather than genuine temporal precedence.\n    \\item \\textbf{Regime dependence.} Permutation Granger tests find 24/24 canary$\\to$diversity pairs FDR-significant at full synthetic replacement ($\\alpha{=}1.0$) but 0/8 at $\\alpha{\\leq}0.50$, demonstrating that detectability depends sharply on the contamination level.\n\\end{enumerate}\nTo move beyond single-method analysis, we propose a multi-method consensus framework with empirically calibrated thresholds, requiring agreement across multiple independent statistical methods and random seeds before classifying a lead-lag relationship as robust.\n\nThe framework's utility is demonstrated by its calibration on built-in experimental controls.\nNaive cross-correlation identifies 100\\% of canary--collapse metric pairs as FDR-significant; the consensus pipeline (requiring ${\\geq}4/5$ methods and ${\\geq}3/4$ seeds) retains only those pairs meeting effect-size criteria calibrated against the null control.\nOn reference extremes, the framework achieves a false positive rate of 0\\% at the $\\alpha{=}0.0$ null control (single seed) (where individual methods reach up to 100\\% FPR) and a false negative rate of 0\\% against six effect-size reference pairs at $\\alpha{=}1.0$.\nApplying the framework, we identify token entropy as a one-generation-ahead canary for diversity collapse at $\\alpha{=}1.0$, validated by the full consensus pipeline, with cross-correlation $|r|{>}0.99$ and directional asymmetry confirmed by 0/24 reverse-direction FDR-significant pairs; preliminary single-seed evidence at $\\alpha{=}0.75$ awaits multi-seed confirmation.\nWe note that Granger precedence establishes temporal predictive improvement, not true causality~\\cite{shojaie2022granger}.\n\nOur contributions are:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item \\textbf{Systematic exposure of three methodological pitfalls} (method sensitivity, spurious regression, regime dependence) in lead-lag analysis of iterative training collapse.\n    Method choice alone inflates spurious-signal rates to at least 62.5\\%; first-differencing eliminates canary$\\to$perplexity associations entirely; and the same Granger test shifts from 24/24 FDR-significant pairs to 0/8 across contamination levels.\n    These results demonstrate that single-method, single-regime analyses---the current norm in this literature---are unreliable.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{A multi-method consensus framework} that instantiates known statistical methods in a novel sequential pipeline with empirical calibration, achieving FNR${=}$0\\% on effect-size reference pairs (4-method panel, permutation Granger power${=}1.0$) with four-tier practical guidance.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Identification of token entropy as a robust one-generation-ahead canary} for diversity collapse at $\\alpha{\\geq}0.75$, confirmed by 4 independent methods, 4 seeds, and cross-architecture replication on GPT-2-medium, with complete directional asymmetry (24/24 forward, 0/24 reverse). The claim is scoped to diversity metrics (distinct-$n$), not model collapse broadly.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows.\n\\S\\ref{sec:related_work} surveys related work on model collapse, early-warning signals, and lead-lag methodology.\n\\S\\ref{sec:background} establishes the formal setup, notation, and the five detection methods used throughout.\n\\S\\ref{sec:method} distills the three methodological pitfalls into a unified diagnostic framework, presents the multi-method consensus pipeline, and reports its empirical calibration.\n\\S\\ref{sec:experiments} provides full experimental results: method sensitivity analysis (\\S\\ref{sec:method_sensitivity}), regime-dependent detectability (\\S\\ref{sec:regime}), a case study of canary prediction of diversity collapse (\\S\\ref{sec:case_study}), and consensus framework validation (\\S\\ref{sec:consensus_validation}).\n\\S\\ref{sec:discussion} discusses implications---including the practical utility paradox, the token entropy--perplexity distinction, and NLP-specific constraints on lead-lag analysis---and outlines directions for future work.\n\\S\\ref{sec:conclusion} concludes, followed by a dedicated Limitations section (\\S\\ref{sec:limitations}).",

62	The spurious-signal rate---the fraction of pairs detected by the most liberal method but not confirmed by the most conservative---is \textbf{75\%} across all five methods and \textbf{62.5\%} when excluding Toda--Yamamoto, whose low statistical power at $T{=}10$ inflates this rate (\S\ref{sec:consensus_validation}).
63	Table~\ref{tab:method_comparison} reports significance rates restricted to 8 validated canary$\to$downstream pairs (excluding failed candidates); the 16-pair rates above include effective rank and Self-BLEU to capture the full method-sensitivity landscape.
64	
65	\paragraph{First-differencing diagnostic.}
66	A single preprocessing decision can eliminate an entire analysis channel.
67	For canary$\to$diversity pairs at $\alpha{=}1.0$, all pairs retain unanimous FDR significance after first-differencing (24/24$\to$24/24), confirming genuine temporal precedence rather than shared-trend confounding.
68	For canary$\to$perplexity, however, undifferenced tests find near-universal significance ($F{=}16$--$36$) while differenced tests find \textbf{zero} significant pairs ($F{\approx}0$, $p{=}0.99$; Figure~\ref{fig:differencing_dmax}a).
69	The apparent canary$\to$perplexity relationship is entirely an artifact of co-trending.

```text
The remaining "preliminary/single-seed" mentions in the context of α=0.75:
1. discussion.tex L18: "Preliminary cross-architecture validation on GPT-2-medium (single seed, α=1.0)" — this is about GPT-2m, not α=0.75. "Preliminary" here is appropriate because GPT-2m validation IS single-seed.
2. discussion.tex L83: "beyond our preliminary single-seed GPT-2-medium result" — same, about GPT-2m. Keep.


3. limitations.tex L7: "preliminary cross-architecture validation uses GPT-2-medium" — about GPT-2m. Keep.

Other "single seed" mentions are either about α=0.0 FPR or GPT-2m, both appropriate. I've already updated the key locations where α=0.75 was incorrectly labeled as preliminary or single-seed: introduction L33, experiments L124, experiments L172-176, limitations L29, and conclusion. Now I need to update the appendix table.

The caption currently says "other levels: single seed" but α=0.75 is now 3-seed, so that needs fixing. I should also check experiments.tex L14 to see what it says about seed counts in the setup section.

mean = (-38.4 + -40.0 + -37.5)/3 = -115.9/3 = -38.6
std: deviations: 0.2, -1.4, 1.1
variance = (0.04 + 1.96 + 1.21)/2 = 3.21/2 = 1.605

42	\paragraph{Effective rank direction is model-dependent.}
43	Effective rank evolves in opposite directions across architectures during iterative training.
44	In Pythia-410M, effective rank decreases (representational contraction), consistent with mode collapse concentrating the output distribution into fewer dimensions.

46	The likely explanation is starting-point dependence: GPT-2-medium begins near rank-2 (a highly concentrated initial representation), and iterative training disperses activation mass across more dimensions rather than concentrating it further.
47	This finding demonstrates that effective rank cannot serve as a direction-agnostic canary and that its trajectory must be interpreted relative to architecture-specific baselines.
48	We note this as a caveat on the generality of representational metrics as collapse indicators, even when the regime map (Table~\ref{tab:cross_arch_regime}) and lead-lag detectability are consistent across architectures.

[Director 指令] [Patch — Table 2 补全 + FDR 透明性注释]

两项修改：

**1. Table 2 α=0.75 列补全**（Agent 已提供 per-method breakdown）：
- Naive XCorr: — (不适用，无 FDR 框架)
- Diff XCorr (FDR): 24/24 (100%)
- Threshold Onset: 12/24 (50%) — token_entropy leads +1 gen, ECE 同代 onset
- Perm Granger (FDR): 19/24 (79.2%)
- TY Granger: 3/24 (12.5%) — underpowered per C003

删除之前的 "---†" 占位符和 "pending" caption 注释。

**2. §4.2 添加 Bonferroni 敏感性注释**（Reviewer 建议，增加透明性）
在报告 "19/24 forward pairs FDR-significant" 之后加一句：
"Under Bonferroni correction, approximately 3/8 pairs per seed survive—consistent with the transitional nature of the α=0.75 boundary where marginal signals are sensitivity to correction stringency."

这展示了审稿人可能提出的替代分析，并预先回应。

**3. 确认旧的 "3/8 pairs reach FDR significance" (单 seed 旧分析) 已不存在于正文中**。如果还有残留，删除。

做完后跑 check_paper_consistency。

124	Permutation Granger tests (first-differenced, BH-corrected) find 0/8 pairs FDR-significant at $\alpha{=}0.00$, 0/8 at $\alpha{=}0.25$, 0/8 at $\alpha{=}0.50$, and \textbf{6/8} at $\alpha{=}1.0$ in the cross-$\alpha$ pooled analysis.
125	At $\alpha{=}0.75$ (3~seeds), permutation Granger finds 19/24 forward-direction pairs FDR-significant with 0/24 reverse, confirming directional asymmetry; however, method-level consensus varies by seed (Tier~3 pairs: 4, 3, and 1 across seeds), placing this regime in a transitional detection state.
126	Within-$\alpha$ multi-seed analysis at $\alpha{=}1.0$ yields \textbf{24/24} canary$\to$diversity pairs FDR-significant across all four seeds, with 0/24 in the reverse direction, confirming temporal asymmetry.
127	The detectability boundary---the regime below which canary metrics no longer develop sufficient temporal lead for causal inference---lies at $\alpha \approx 0.50$--$0.75$, consistent with theoretical expectations about signal-to-noise limits in short time series \cite{boettiger2012limits}.
128	A detectability transition exists between $\alpha{=}0.50$ and $\alpha{=}0.75$: below this range, no method achieves FDR-corrected significance (0/24+ tests); within it, directional asymmetry emerges robustly (19/24 forward, 0/24 reverse) but method consensus remains transitional (Tier~2--3); above it ($\alpha{=}1.0$), full Confirmatory consensus is achieved (24/24 forward, Tier~3 across 4~seeds).
129	This seed-dependent variability at $\alpha{=}0.75$ is a feature, not a limitation: it maps the boundary region where individual-seed stochasticity determines whether the consensus threshold is crossed.
130	Cross-architecture validation on GPT-2-medium confirms this boundary: at $\alpha{=}0.25$, at most 1/8 pairs reach Confirmatory consensus ($K{\geq}4/5$)---consistent with the null regime---despite substantially stronger canary drift (entropy $-32.8\%$ vs.\ Pythia $-4.7{\pm}0.5\%$), while at $\alpha{=}1.0$ all 6 canary$\to$diversity pairs reach $K{\geq}4/5$ (\S\ref{sec:discussion}).
131	Table~\ref{tab:cross_arch_regime} summarizes the regime map across both architectures.

[Director 指令] [Patch — Figures] 创建论文 Figure 环境

Paper Agent 之前标记 figure environments 尚未创建（仅有 \ref{fig:...} 占位）。现在创建所有 figure 的 LaTeX 环境。

**需要创建的 5 个 Figures：**

1. **fig:differencing_dmax** — 展示 first-differencing + d_max sensitivity 的效果。内容：3 panel subplot (d_max=0, 1, adaptive)，每 panel 展示某 metric pair 的 ACF/XCorr 变化。暂用 placeholder `\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/differencing_dmax.pdf}` + 详细 caption。

2. **fig:consensus_heatmap** — Method × α heatmap（K-of-M consensus tier by method and contamination level）。caption 说明色彩编码（Tier 1/2/3）和关键发现（对角线模式表明 method-regime interaction）。

3. **fig:regime_map** — α=0.0 到 α=1.0 的 detectability regime map。X轴=α，Y轴=significance rate or consensus tier。展示 boundary at 0.50-0.75 的 sharp transition。

4. **fig:metric_trajectory** — 典型 α=1.0 run 的 metric trajectories（10 gen）。展示 entropy 在 gen 1 骤降而 diversity 在 gen 2-3 才开始下降 → visual 证明 canary lead。

5. **fig:consensus_workflow** — Sequential filtering pipeline workflow diagram。展示 Raw Data → Differencing → 5-Method Panel → K-of-M Vote → Tier Classification 的流程。

**每个 Figure 要求：**
- `\begin{figure}[t]` 环境 + `\label{fig:xxx}`
- `\includegraphics` 指向 `figures/xxx.pdf`（文件尚未存在，后续由 Agent 生成）
- 自含 caption（reader 不看正文也能理解）
- Caption 包含实验条件 + key takeaway

如果 figures/ 目录在 docs/paper/ 下不存在，在 tex 中直接引用路径即可（编译时会报 warning 但不阻塞文字审稿）。

做完后跑 check_paper_consistency。

<details><summary>Logged reasoning block</summary>

```text
I need to create 5 figure environments in the paper. Let me figure out where each should go based on where they're referenced.

From the grep earlier:
1. `fig:differencing_dmax` — referenced in experiments.tex L65, L69 and method.tex L22
2. `fig:consensus_heatmap` — referenced in experiments.tex L80, L86, L133 and method.tex L30
3. `fig:regime_map` — referenced in experiments.tex L119
4. `fig:metric_trajectory` — referenced in experiments.tex L145 (now maybe shifted)


5. `fig:consensus_workflow` — referenced in experiments.tex L168 (now shifted) and method.tex L51

Now I'm mapping out the optimal placement for each figure near their first references. The differencing and consensus heatmap figures should go in section 4.1 where the method sensitivity is discussed, the regime map belongs in section 4.2, the metric trajectory in section 4.3 for the case study, and the workflow figure around where it's first cited in the experiments section.
```

65	\paragraph{First-differencing diagnostic.}
66	A single preprocessing decision can eliminate an entire analysis channel.
67	For canary$\to$diversity pairs at $\alpha{=}1.0$, all pairs retain unanimous FDR significance after first-differencing (24/24$\to$24/24), confirming genuine temporal precedence rather than shared-trend confounding.
68	For canary$\to$perplexity, however, undifferenced tests find near-universal significance ($F{=}16$--$36$) while differenced tests find \textbf{zero} significant pairs ($F{\approx}0$, $p{=}0.99$; Figure~\ref{fig:differencing_dmax}a).
69	The apparent canary$\to$perplexity relationship is entirely an artifact of co-trending.
70	Notably, at $\alpha{=}0.75$, differenced cross-correlation finds 8/8 pairs significant in \emph{both} forward and reverse directions per seed, demonstrating that this method alone cannot distinguish genuine directional precedence from shared dynamics even after detrending.
71	
72	\paragraph{Augmentation order sensitivity.}
73	Toda--Yamamoto Granger tests show extreme sensitivity to the augmentation order $d_{\max}$ (Figure~\ref{fig:differencing_dmax}b).
74	At $d_{\max}{=}0$ (most permissive), approximately 6\% of pairs are rejected; at adaptive $d_{\max}$ determined by ADF unit-root tests, 75\%; at $d_{\max}{=}1$ (most conservative), \textbf{94\%}.
75	This single hyperparameter swings conclusions from near-universal significance to near-universal non-significance.
76	
77	\paragraph{Inter-method agreement.}
78	Cohen's $\kappa$, averaged over all method pairs, is \textbf{0.185} (near chance; poor agreement); this value is consistent across contamination levels ($\alpha{=}0.0$ through $\alpha{=}1.0$), indicating that method disagreement is a structural property of the analysis rather than a regime-specific artifact.
79	Cross-architecture validation on GPT-2-medium (12 canary$\to$downstream pairs) yields Fleiss' $\kappa{=}0.091$, also in the ``slight agreement'' range, confirming that low inter-method agreement is not architecture-specific.
80	Restricting to three informative methods (excluding naive cross-correlation and Toda--Yamamoto, which anchor the permissive and conservative extremes respectively) raises $\kappa$ to 0.667 (substantial agreement), indicating that the low full-panel $\kappa$ is driven by the deliberate inclusion of methods spanning the entire permissive-to-conservative spectrum rather than by fundamental incoherence among methods.
81	Table~\ref{tab:method_comparison} extends the analysis across contamination levels.
82	At $\alpha{=}0.0$ (no synthetic data, serving as null control), naive cross-correlation finds \textbf{100\%} of pairs significant---a textbook spurious-regression outcome in trending time series.
83	Permutation Granger and Toda--Yamamoto correctly find 0\%.
84	At $\alpha{=}0.50$, correlation-based methods (naive, differenced, threshold) unanimously find significance while causal methods unanimously find non-significance (Figure~\ref{fig:consensus_heatmap}), the most extreme method$\times$regime divergence in our experiments.
85	
86	\paragraph{Method$\times$regime interaction.}
87	Table~\ref{tab:method_comparison} reveals that the correlation-versus-causal divergence is not uniform across contamination levels.
88	At $\alpha{=}0.25$, differenced cross-correlation drops to 25\% and threshold onset to 37.5\%, while naive cross-correlation remains at 100\%---demonstrating that even partial detrending removes marginal associations at low contamination.
89	In low-contamination regimes ($\alpha{\leq}0.50$), the false confirmation rate for the most liberal method approaches 100\%, while all Granger-type tests correctly find 0\%---a regime where single-method analysis is maximally dangerous.
90	The graded response across methods, combined with the block structure visible in Figure~\ref{fig:consensus_heatmap}, motivates the regime-dependent analysis in \S\ref{sec:regime}.

50	\paragraph{Sequential filtering pipeline.}
51	In practice, the $K$-of-$M$ voting operates over all five methods applied independently to each pair; the sequential pipeline below describes the order in which results are examined, enabling early termination and interpretable diagnostics at each stage (Figure~\ref{fig:consensus_workflow}):
52	\begin{enumerate}
53	    \item \textbf{Naive correlation scan.} Cross-correlation at maximum lag~5 with BH correction serves as a permissive baseline; all pairs with any temporal association pass.
54	    \item \textbf{First-differencing diagnostic.} Cross-correlation is recomputed on first-differenced series, testing whether temporal associations survive removal of shared linear trends. Pairs that lose significance are flagged as potential spurious regressions.
55	    \item \textbf{Permutation Granger causality.} Permutation-based Granger causality tests \cite{shojaie2022granger} on first-differenced series (5{,}000 permutations, BH correction at $q{=}0.05$) assess directional predictive improvement: whether past values of $X$ improve prediction of $Y$ beyond $Y$'s own history.
56	    \item \textbf{Multi-seed replication.} The conclusion must hold across $S$ of $N$ independent training seeds, filtering seed-specific artifacts.
57	\end{enumerate}
58	At $\alpha{=}1.0$, this pipeline progressively filters: 16 pairs pass Stage~1, 14 survive Stage~2 (differencing removes 2 marginal canary$\to$perplexity pairs), 6 survive Stage~3 (Granger testing eliminates remaining canary$\to$perplexity pairs and failed canary candidates), and all~6 survive Stage~4 (multi-seed replication confirms all Granger-significant pairs).
59	
60	\paragraph{Practical guidance.}
61	The consensus thresholds $(K, S)$ should be chosen to match the analyst's tolerance for false positives versus false negatives.
62	Table~\ref{tab:practical_guidance} provides four recommended tiers, calibrated against our experimental controls (\S\ref{sec:calibration}).
63	Tier~3 ($K{\geq}4/5$, $S{\geq}3/4$) achieves the best trade-off in our setting: zero false positives while recovering all six reference pairs.

165	We scope this claim precisely: canary metrics predict \emph{diversity collapse} (declining distinct-$n$), not model collapse broadly.

Good. Now I'll create all 5 figure environments. Optimal placements:
1. `fig:differencing_dmax` → after L75 (end of augmentation order paragraph)
2. `fig:consensus_heatmap` → after L90 (end of method×regime interaction, before Table 2)
3. `fig:regime_map` → after L121 (end of raw drift, before Granger-precedence detectability)
4. `fig:metric_trajectory` → after L172 (end of full synthetic replacement paragraph)
5. `fig:consensus_workflow` → in method.tex after L58 (end of pipeline description)

This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The summary below covers the earlier portion of the conversation.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The Paper Agent is coordinating Step 5 (Iterative Refinement) and executing sequential Director-issued Patches for a major Round 1 revision (Weak Reject) of an EMNLP 2026 paper titled "Method Matters: Pitfalls and a Multi-Method Consensus Framework for Lead-Lag Analysis in Iterative Training Collapse" (project: distrib_canary_collapse). The Director issues Patch instructions requiring precise surgical edits across multiple LaTeX files with cross-section consistency verification. The Paper Agent uses `paper_agent_post_to_director` (NOT `main_agent_post_to_director`) to report results, and must ignore false-positive system reminders about `main_agent_post_to_director`.

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - **Granger precedence** (NOT causation): temporal predictive improvement, scoped claim
   - **Effect-size reference pairs**: drift ratio ≥3× α=0.0 baseline + canary onset ≥1 gen ahead
   - **FNR calibration**: 4-method panel excluding differenced XCorr; K≥3/4 → FNR=0%
   - **PermG bootstrap power**: power=1.0 genuine, 0.0 spurious; TY 0.05-0.20
   - **Spurious-signal rate**: "at least 62.5%" (4 non-TY methods), 75% including TY
   - **Regime boundary**: α≈0.50–0.75, detectability transition (not sharp boundary)
   - **α=0.75 3-seed results**: 19/24 forward FDR-sig, 0/24 reverse; Tier 3 pairs: 4,3,1 per seed; transitional regime (Tier 2-3)
   - **Bonferroni sensitivity**: ~3/8 pairs per seed survive at α=0.75
   - **diff_xcorr at α=0.75**: 8/8 both directions per seed (cannot distinguish directionality)
   - **Cross-architecture validation**: GPT-2m α=1.0 Tier 3 (6/6 pairs), α=0.25 ≤1/8 Confirmatory
   - **Diversity-calibration dissociation**: Diversity worst at α=0.25, ECE monotonically increasing
   - **Token entropy vs perplexity**: H(p|context) on held-out real data vs exp(H_cross) on generated text
   - **Practical utility paradox**: Canary works at high α (least needed), fails at low α (most needed)
   - **T-notation**: T = generation cycles; data points = T+1
   - **3-seed α=0.25**: seeds 42/43/44; 3-seed α=0.75: seeds 42/43/44; 4-seed α=1.0: seeds 42/43/44/45
   - **κ range**: Cohen's κ=0.185 (Pythia pairwise), Fleiss' κ=0.091 (GPT-2m full panel)
   - **50-57% flip rate**: pairs classified significant under one method flip to non-significant under another
   - **Low-α false confirmation**: approaches 100% for correlation-based methods at α≤0.50

3. Files and Code Sections:

   - **`abstract.tex`** (~120 words, heavily revised)
     - Added κ=0.091-0.185, FPR=0%, "at least 62.5%", low-α approaching 100%, α=0.75 transitional regime
     - Current content:
     ```latex
     \begin{abstract}
     We show that lead-lag conclusions in iterative model collapse are fragile: method choice alone inflates spurious-signal rates to at least 62.5\% (inter-method $\kappa{=}0.091$--$0.185$), approaching 100\% in low-contamination regimes ($\alpha{\leq}0.50$).
     We identify three pitfalls---method sensitivity, spurious regression under shared trends, and regime dependence---and propose a multi-method consensus framework requiring ${\geq}4/5$ methods with FDR correction, achieving FPR${=}$0\% and FNR${=}$0\% on effect-size reference pairs.
     First-differencing cleanly separates genuine from spurious channels: all canary$\to$diversity leads survive while all canary$\to$perplexity leads vanish.
     Applied to Pythia-410M and replicated on GPT-2-medium, the framework identifies token entropy as a one-generation-ahead canary for diversity collapse at full synthetic replacement (24/24 forward, 0/24 reverse, four methods, four seeds), with directional asymmetry extending to $\alpha{=}0.75$ (19/24 forward, 0/24 reverse, three seeds) in a transitional consensus regime.

   - **`references.bib`**: No changes in this session (4 entries added in previous session: granger1974spurious, toda1995statistical, hataya2023will, seddik2024bad)

4. Errors and Fixes:
   - **discussion.tex "File has not been read yet" error**: When trying to edit discussion.tex to add Appendix B cross-reference, got this error. Fixed by reading the file first (offset 32, limit 6), then re-attempting the edit.
   - **False-positive system reminders (~10+ occurrences)**: System repeatedly urged calling `main_agent_post_to_director`. Paper Agent correctly uses `paper_agent_post_to_director` per CLAUDE.md instructions. All were properly ignored with "No response requested."
   - **Table 2 α=0.75 partial data**: Initially filled with ---† placeholders for Threshold and TY. Later resolved when Director provided per-method breakdown (Threshold=50, TY=12.5).

5. Problem Solving:
   - **α=0.75 3-seed mean±std computation**: Computed from registry data for all metrics (entropy, ECE, d1, d2, d3, ppl) across seeds 42/43/44, propagated to Table 1, running text, and appendix
   - **Internal contradiction (0/8 vs 1/8)**: experiments.tex L129 said "0/8" while L131 said "1/8" for GPT-2m α=0.25 Tier 3. Fixed L129 to "at most 1/8—consistent with null regime"
   - **Registry ID cleanup**: 5 \texttt{} markers across experiments.tex and discussion.tex converted to LaTeX comments for provenance tracking without PDF visibility
   - **Cross-section consistency**: Every patch followed by check_paper_consistency (always 0 critical, 0 warning) and key number grep verification (e.g., "19/24" across 7 locations, "at least 62.5%" across 3 locations)
   - **Figure environments**: Created all 5 missing figure environments with placeholder \includegraphics and self-contained captions

6. All User Messages:
   - "Continue from where you left off." (multiple times, resuming after patches)
   - "[系统提醒] 你刚才完成了 [Director 指令] 但没有调用 main_agent_post_to_director..." (10+ false positive reminders, all ignored)
   - "[Director 指令] [Patch — 小修] experiments.tex TY power 范围不一致修复" — L188 0.09-0.21 → 0.05-0.20 (already fixed)
   - "[Director 指令] [Patch — 非数据依赖优化] Abstract + Claim 措辞打磨" — Abstract refinement, cross-arch consistency, conclusion check
   - "[Director 指令] [Patch 补充 — Claim 措辞升级]" — "at least 62.5%", low-α false confirmation 100%, κ near chance, 50-57% flip rate
   - "[Director 指令] [Patch — 等待窗口打磨] Related work + Figure captions + Methodology 描述" — Expand new citations, check table captions, method readability
   - "[Director 指令] [Patch — Appendix 补充] Window sensitivity table" — Create Appendix B with T_min sensitivity table
   - "[Director 指令] [Patch — 必须修复] experiments.tex 内部矛盾 + registry ID 清理" — Fix 0/8 vs 1/8 + remove \texttt markers
   - "[Director 指令] [Patch — PENDING DATA 解锁] α=0.75 multi-seed 结果写入（D051）" — Massive 9-file patch with 3-seed data
   - "[Director 指令] [Patch — Table 2 补全 + FDR 透明性注释]" — Fill Threshold=50, TY=12.5, add Bonferroni note
   - "[Director 指令] [Patch — Figures] 创建论文 Figure 环境" — Create 5 figure LaTeX environments with captions

7. Pending Tasks:
   - **check_paper_consistency for Figure environments**: Most recent patch (Figures) has NOT yet been verified
   - **Report Figure environments to Director**: paper_agent_post_to_director not yet called for the Figures patch
   - **Figure PDF generation**: All 5 figures use placeholder \includegraphics paths (figures/xxx.pdf) — actual PDFs to be generated by Agent
   - **I2 Cao et al. venue verification**: Director previously said "Agent 处理" — still pending
   - **α=0.0 multi-seed**: PENDING DATA — FPR "(N seeds)" update when available
   - **Step 5 Reviewer Round 2**: After all patches complete, should submit for another review round
   - **Step 5e three-piece suite**: After convergence: paper-visual-review → verify_references(skip_online=False) → check_provenance_completeness

8. Current Work:
   Most recently completed creating 5 figure LaTeX environments per Director instruction "[Patch — Figures] 创建论文 Figure 环境". Created:
   - `fig:differencing_dmax` in experiments.tex (after augmentation order paragraph, ~L76)
   - `fig:consensus_heatmap` in experiments.tex (before Table 2, ~L92)
   - `fig:regime_map` in experiments.tex (after raw drift paragraph, ~L122)
   - `fig:metric_trajectory` in experiments.tex (after full synthetic replacement paragraph, ~L173)
   - `fig:consensus_workflow` in method.tex (after pipeline enumeration, ~L59)
   
   Each has `\begin{figure}[t]`, `\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/xxx.pdf}`, a self-contained caption with experimental conditions and key takeaway, and `\label{fig:xxx}`.
   
   Had NOT yet run check_paper_consistency or reported to Director via paper_agent_post_to_director.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Complete the Figures patch:
   1. Run `check_paper_consistency` for the paper
   2. Report to Director via `paper_agent_post_to_director` with summary of 5 figure environments created
   
   This directly continues the most recent Director instruction: "[Patch — Figures] 创建论文 Figure 环境" which ends with "做完后跑 check_paper_consistency。"

full results appear in \\S\\ref{sec:experiments}.\n\n\\paragraph{Pitfall 1: Method sensitivity.}\nApplied to the same data ($\\alpha{=}1.0$, 4~seeds, 16 canary$\\to$downstream pairs---4 candidate canaries $\\times$ 4 downstream metrics, including candidates later excluded per \\S\\ref{sec:case_study}), five lead-lag detection methods yield FDR significance rates ranging from 100\\% (naive cross-correlation) to 25\\% (Toda--Yamamoto Granger causality), with inter-method agreement of Cohen's $\\kappa{=}0.185$---poor agreement (\\S\\ref{sec:method_sensitivity}).\nThe spurious-signal rate---the fraction of pairs flagged by the most liberal method but not confirmed by the most conservative---is 75\\% across all five methods and 62.5\\% when excluding Toda--Yamamoto, whose low statistical power at $T{=}10$ inflates this rate.\nThis pitfall is dangerous because method choice alone can determine whether a lead-lag relationship is deemed present or absent.\nIn a literature where single-method analyses are the norm, the implicit assumption that method choice does not matter is demonstrably false.\n\n\\paragraph{Pitfall 2: Spurious regression under shared trends.}\nA single preprocessing decision---first-differencing to remove shared non-stationary trends~\\cite{granger1974spurious}---can eliminate an entire analysis channel.\nAt $\\alpha{=}1.0$, canary$\\to$perplexity pairs appear near-universally significant in undifferenced analysis ($F{=}16$--$36$) but yield $F{\\approx}0$, $p{=}0.99$ after differencing (Figure~\\ref{fig:differencing_dmax}a; \\S\\ref{sec:method_sensitivity}).\nIn contrast, canary$\\to$diversity pairs retain unanimous FDR significance after differencing (24/24$\\to$24/24).\nWithout the differencing diagnostic, an analyst would conclude that canaries predict perplexity---a conclusion entirely driven by co-trending rather than temporal precedence.\nThe danger lies in the selective nature of this confound: only by applying the diagnostic can one determine which channels are genuine and which are artifacts of shared non-stationarity.\n\n\\paragraph{Pitfall 3: Regime dependence.}\nEven after fixing the statistical method, the contamination level~$\\alpha$ determines whether a lead-lag relationship is detectable.\nPermutation Granger tests (first-differenced, BH FDR-corrected at $q{=}0.05$) find 6/8 pairs FDR-significant at $\\alpha{=}1.0$ but 0/8 at all $\\alpha{\\leq}0.50$ (\\S\\ref{sec:regime}).\nThe $\\alpha{=}0.50$ regime is particularly dangerous: correlation-based methods unanimously find significance while causal methods unanimously find non-significance (Figure~\\ref{fig:consensus_heatmap}), creating the maximum risk of spurious conclusions---high correlation coexists with zero causal precedence.\nThis regime dependence is consistent with theoretical expectations about signal-to-noise limits in short ecological time series \\cite{boettiger2012limits}, and suggests that detectability boundaries should be explicitly mapped rather than assumed.\n\n\n\\subsection{Multi-Method Consensus Framework}\n\\label{sec:consensus}\n\nThe pitfalls above motivate a consensus approach inspired by multi-method validation practices in early-warning signal detection \\cite{scheffer2009early}: rather than relying on any single method, we require agreement across multiple independent methods and random seeds before classifying a lead-lag relationship as robust.\n\n\\paragraph{Formal definition.}\nGiven $M$ lead-lag detection methods $\\{m_1, \\ldots, m_M\\}$ and $N$ independent random seeds, a canary$\\to$downstream pair $(X, Y)$ is classified as \\textsc{robust} if and only if:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item At least $K$ of $M$ methods judge the pair FDR-significant, where each method independently applies Benjamini--Hochberg correction at $q{=}0.05$; and\n    \\item At least $S$ of $N$ seeds replicate this conclusion.\n\\end{enumerate}\nThe thresholds $(K, S)$ control the trade-off between false positive and false negative rates.\nMethods with different inductive biases---correlation-based methods that detect any temporal association versus Granger-type methods that test directional predictive improvement \\cite{granger1969investigating}---provide complementary evidence.\nTheir convergence on a given pair constitutes stronger evidence than agreement among methods sharing the same statistical assumptions.\nWe note that Granger precedence establishes temporal predictive improvement, not true causality \\cite{shojaie2022granger}; our framework inherits this limitation.\n\n\\paragraph{Sequential filtering pipeline.}\nIn practice, the $K$-of-$M$ voting operates over all five methods applied independently to each pair; the sequential pipeline below describes the order in which results are examined, enabling early termination and interpretable diagnostics at each stage (Figure~\\ref{fig:consensus_workflow}):\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item \\textbf{Naive correlation scan.} Cross-correlation at maximum lag~5 with BH correction serves as a permissive baseline; all pairs with any temporal association pass.\n    \\item \\textbf{First-differencing diagnostic.} Cross-correlation is recomputed on first-differenced series, testing whether temporal associations survive removal of shared linear trends. Pairs that lose significance are flagged as potential spurious regressions.\n    \\item \\textbf{Permutation Granger causality.} Permutation-based Granger causality tests \\cite{shojaie2022granger} on first-differenced series (5{,}000 permutations, BH correction at $q{=}0.05$) assess directional predictive improvement: whether past values of $X$ improve prediction of $Y$ beyond $Y$'s own history.\n    \\item \\textbf{Multi-seed replication.} The conclusion must hold across $S$ of $N$ independent training seeds, filtering seed-specific artifacts.\n\\end{enumerate}\nAt $\\alpha{=}1.0$, this pipeline progressively filters: 16 pairs pass Stage~1, 14 survive Stage~2 (differencing removes 2 marginal canary$\\to$perplexity pairs), 6 survive Stage~3 (Granger testing eliminates remaining canary$\\to$perplexity pairs and failed canary candidates), and all~6 survive Stage~4 (multi-seed replication confirms all Granger-significant pairs).\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{figures/consensus_workflow.pdf}\n\\caption{Sequential filtering pipeline of the multi-method consensus framework. Starting from all candidate canary$\\to$downstream pairs, the pipeline applies four stages: (1)~naive cross-correlation scan (permissive baseline), (2)~first-differencing diagnostic (removes shared-trend artifacts), (3)~permutation Granger causality (tests directional predictive improvement), and (4)~multi-seed replication (filters seed-specific artifacts). At $\\alpha{=}1.0$ (Pythia-410M), the pipeline reduces 16 candidate pairs to 6 robust pairs: 16$\\to$14$\\to$6$\\to$6.

Automated behaviors (\"from now on when X\", \"each time X\", \"whenever X\", \"before/after X\") require hooks configured in settings.json - the harness executes these, not Claude, so memory/preferences cannot fulfill them. Also use for: permissions (\"allow X\", \"add permission\", \"move permission to\"), env vars (\"set X=Y\"), hook troubleshooting, or any changes to settings.json/settings.local.json files. Examples: \"allow npm commands\", \"add bq permission to global settings\", \"move permission to user settings\", \"set DEBUG=true\", \"when claude stops show X\". For simple settings like theme/model, suggest the /config command.\n- keybindings-help: Use when the user wants to customize keyboard shortcuts, rebind keys, add chord bindings, or modify ~/.claude/keybindings.json. Examples: \"rebind ctrl+s\", \"add a chord shortcut\", \"change the submit key\", \"customize keybindings\".\n- simplify: Review changed code for reuse, quality, and efficiency, then fix any issues found.\n- fewer-permission-prompts: Scan your transcripts for common read-only Bash and MCP tool calls, then add a prioritized allowlist to project .claude/settings.json to reduce permission prompts.\n- loop: Run a prompt or slash command on a recurring interval (e.g. /loop 5m /foo). Omit the interval to let the model self-pace. - When the user wants to set up a recurring task, poll for status, or run something repeatedly on an interval (e.g. \"check the deploy every 5 minutes\", \"keep running /babysit-prs\"). Do NOT invoke for one-off tasks.\n- schedule: Create, update, list, or run scheduled remote agents (routines) that execute on a cron schedule. - When the user wants to schedule a recurring remote agent, set up automated tasks, create a cron job for Claude Code, or manage their scheduled agents/routines. Also use when the user wants a one-time scheduled run (\"run this once at 3pm\", \"remind me to check X tomorrow\").\n- claude-api: Build, debug, and optimize Claude API / Anthropic SDK apps. Apps built with this skill should include prompt caching. Also handles migrating existing Claude API code between Claude model versions (4.5 → 4.6, 4.6 → 4.7, retired-model replacements).\nTRIGGER when: code imports `anthropic`/`@anthropic-ai/sdk`; user asks for the Claude API, Anthropic SDK, or Managed Agents; user adds/modifies/tunes a Claude feature (caching, thinking, compaction, tool use, batch, files, citations, memory) or model (Opus/Sonnet/Haiku) in a file; questions about prompt caching / cache hit rate in an Anthropic SDK project.\nSKIP: file imports `openai`/other-provider SDK, filename like `*-openai.py`/`*-generic.py`, provider-neutral code, general programming/ML.\n- init: Initialize a new CLAUDE.md file with codebase documentation\n- review: Review a pull request\n- security-review: Complete a security review of the pending changes on the current branch",

[Director 指令] [Patch] Reviewer proofread 发现 2 个 must-fix + 3 个 nice-to-fix，请一次性修复：

**Must-fix 1: introduction.tex ~L44**
Contribution #3 混淆了 α=1.0 和 α=0.75 两个 regime 的数据。当前写的是 "4 seeds" + "24/24 forward" + "complete directional asymmetry"，但这些只对 α=1.0 成立。α=0.75 是 3 seeds, 19/24 forward。

修正方向：拆分为两层，仿照 abstract 格式：
- α=1.0: 24/24 forward, 0/24 reverse, 4 methods, 4 seeds, complete directional asymmetry
- α=0.75: 19/24 forward, 0/24 reverse, 3 seeds, transitional regime

**Must-fix 2: experiments.tex ~L159**
`% provenance: gen_wiki_gpt2m_a025_s42` 注释和 caption 最后一句在同一行，导致 "The regime boundary..." 被 LaTeX % 吞掉，PDF 中不可见。修正：将 provenance 注释移到独立行或删除。

**Nice-to-fix 3-5:**
- 清除所有 `% provenance:` 残留注释（experiments.tex:154, :215, discussion.tex:20, :45）
- 清除 experiments.tex 和 discussion.tex 顶部的 changelog 注释（% 2026-05-16: Added...）
- Table 1 ECE α=0.75 的 ±18 如果有把握是正确的就保留，不确定就标注待核实

完成后跑 check_paper_consistency 确认。

4	\section{Discussion}\label{sec:discussion}
5	
6	\paragraph{Granger precedence is not causation.}
7	Granger causality tests whether past values of one series improve prediction of another beyond its own history; it does not establish true causation~\cite{granger1969investigating,shojaie2022granger}.
8	Bivariate Granger tests cannot exclude confounders: an unobserved process---such as a latent distributional shift in the training data---could independently drive both token entropy and diversity metrics, producing spurious lead-lag associations even when no direct relationship exists.
9	Our multi-method consensus framework inherits this limitation in full.
10	Throughout this paper, ``Granger precedence'' denotes predictive improvement in a time-series forecasting sense, not a causal mechanism.
11	This distinction is why we scope our central claim to ``token entropy Granger-precedes diversity collapse'' rather than asserting that token entropy \emph{causes} diversity collapse.
12	
13	\paragraph{Calibration scope and generalization.}
14	All FPR and FNR calibration results reported in this work are specific to our experimental setup: Pythia-410M~\cite{biderman2023pythia}, a WikiText-103 subset, $T{=}10$ generation cycles, and five contamination levels ($\alpha \in \{0.0, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1.0\}$).
15	Generalization to other model architectures, datasets, or training protocols requires independent validation.
16	The consensus framework's structure---multi-method agreement combined with multi-seed replication---is intended to be applicable beyond this specific setting, but the operating thresholds ($K{\geq}4/5$ methods, $S{\geq}3/4$ seeds) are empirically calibrated and may require re-tuning under different conditions.
17	For instance, architectures with different tokenizer granularity or training dynamics could shift the balance between false positive and false negative rates at these thresholds.
18	Preliminary cross-architecture validation on GPT-2-medium (single seed, $\alpha{=}1.0$) replicates the entropy-leads-diversity pattern at Tier~3 consensus: all 6 canary$\to$diversity pairs reach $K{\geq}4/5$ method agreement (permutation Granger $p_{\text{FDR}}{=}0.003$), with 0/6 reverse-direction pairs significant.
19	Full-panel inter-method agreement remains low (Fleiss' $\kappa{=}0.091$) but rises to $\kappa{=}0.667$ among the three informative methods (\S\ref{sec:method_sensitivity}), confirming that the consensus framework's structure transfers across architectures even if operating thresholds require architecture-specific calibration.
20	At $\alpha{=}0.25$, GPT-2-medium yields 1/8 pairs at Tier~3 consensus ($K{\geq}4/5$) and 7/8 at Tier~2 ($K{\geq}3/5$), placing it in the same null/low-detectability regime as Pythia (0/8 Tier~3) and confirming that the detectability boundary is consistent across two transformer decoder-only model families of similar scale.% provenance: gen_wiki_gpt2m_a025_s42
21	The full GPT-2-medium drift profile at $\alpha{=}0.25$ is: entropy $-32.8\%$, ECE $+422\%$, perplexity $-44.5\%$, distinct-1 $-23.5\%$, distinct-2 $-31.6\%$, distinct-3 $-30.2\%$, MAUVE $0.0315 \to 0.0282$ ($-10.5\%$).
22	Compared to Pythia ($-4.7{\pm}0.5\%$ entropy, $-40.3{\pm}0.3\%$ distinct-1), GPT-2-medium shows substantially stronger canary drift but milder diversity decline---likely due to its $8\times$ larger batch size exposing more data per step.
23	The stronger canary signal approaches detectability (permutation Granger $F{=}64.09$, $p{=}0.081$ for entropy$\to$distinct-1, compared to $p{>}0.5$ in Pythia), suggesting that the regime boundary may shift with increased effective sample size, but single-seed $T{=}10$ power remains insufficient for Confirmatory claims.
24	Toda--Yamamoto Granger finds 1/8 pairs significant, consistent with its known instability at short series lengths (\S\ref{sec:consensus_validation}).
25	
26	\paragraph{FPR/FNR calibration asymmetry.}
27	The FPR and FNR estimates in our calibration analysis differ in their coverage of the seed dimension.
28	FPR is validated on the method dimension only, using a single seed at the null-control condition ($\alpha{=}0.0$).
29	FNR is validated on the joint method${\times}$seed dimension, aggregating across four seeds at full contamination ($\alpha{=}1.0$).
30	This asymmetry means our FPR estimate of 0\% may be optimistic: if seed-level variance in false positive rates is non-negligible, the true FPR under the consensus rule could exceed zero.
31	Full joint calibration---requiring multi-seed null-control experiments at $\alpha{=}0.0$---remains an open direction for future work.
32	
33	\paragraph{Short time-series constraint.}
34	With $T{=}10$ generation cycles (11 data points per series), our time-series analyses operate near the lower bound of what standard methods require.
35	This series length is typical for iterative training studies, where each generation involves a complete training run, but it severely limits statistical power.
36	The Toda--Yamamoto procedure's elevated FNR (33.3\%, missing 2 of 6 directional pairs) is attributable to insufficient residual degrees of freedom at this series length, not to a fundamental deficiency in the method itself.
37	This finding aligns with \citet{boettiger2012limits}, who demonstrated that early-warning signals have limited detection power in short time series.
38	Longer generation chains would improve power for all methods but impose substantial computational cost; this trade-off between statistical power and compute budget is inherent to iterative training research and cannot be resolved by methodological improvements alone.
39	However, observation window sensitivity analysis provides reassurance: the $4/5$ consensus classification stabilizes at $T{\geq}5$, well below our observation window of $T{=}10$, with identical results from $T{=}5$ through $T{=}10$ (Appendix~\ref{app:window_sensitivity}).
40	The Toda--Yamamoto procedure produces valid test statistics at all window lengths ($T \in \{5, \ldots, 10\}$), but with unstable sensitivity---3/6 to 6/6 pairs reach significance depending on window length---confirming that its elevated FNR reflects limited residual degrees of freedom rather than absence of signal.
41	
42	\paragraph{Effective rank direction is model-dependent.}
43	Effective rank evolves in opposite directions across architectures during iterative training.
44	In Pythia-410M, effective rank decreases (representational contraction), consistent with mode collapse concentrating the output distribution into fewer dimensions.
45	In GPT-2-medium at $\alpha{=}0.25$, effective rank \emph{increases} from 2.37 to 8.48 (+258\%).% provenance: gen_wiki_gpt2m_a025_s42
46	The likely explanation is starting-point dependence: GPT-2-medium begins near rank-2 (a highly concentrated initial representation), and iterative training disperses activation mass across more dimensions rather than concentrating it further.
47	This finding demonstrates that effective rank cannot serve as a direction-agnostic canary and that its trajectory must be interpreted relative to architecture-specific baselines.
48	We note this as a caveat on the generality of representational metrics as collapse indicators, even when the regime map (Table~\ref{tab:cross_arch_regime}) and lead-lag detectability are consistent across architectures.
49	
50	\paragraph{Diversity--calibration dissociation.}
51	Diversity metrics and calibration metrics respond to synthetic contamination in qualitatively opposite directions across the $\alpha$ spectrum.
52	Diversity collapse (distinct-$n$ decline) is most severe at low contamination ($\alpha{=}0.25$: distinct-3 declines by $58.9{\pm}0.9\%$) and attenuates at higher levels ($\alpha{=}1.0$: $-30.5\%$), while calibration degradation (ECE) increases monotonically with $\alpha$ ($+51.7\%$ at $\alpha{=}0.0$ to $+3780\%$ at $\alpha{=}1.0$).
53	This dissociation underscores the need for multi-method consensus: the regime in which a metric degrades most severely ($\alpha{=}0.25$ for diversity) does not coincide with the regime in which its temporal lead is most detectable ($\alpha{\geq}0.75$), and a single metric family cannot capture the full picture of iterative training degradation.
54	
55	\paragraph{Practical utility paradox.}
56	The canary framework exhibits a paradox: it works best where it is least needed.
57	At $\alpha{\geq}0.75$, token entropy reliably Granger-precedes diversity collapse---but at these contamination levels, degradation is already severe and likely detectable through simpler means.
58	At $\alpha{\leq}0.50$, where early warning would be most valuable, the canary signal is undetectable by any method tested.
59	This is not a framework deficiency but an inherent characteristic of collapse dynamics: at low contamination, diversity changes are too small relative to inter-generation noise for any temporal lead to emerge above the statistical detection floor~\cite{boettiger2012limits}.
60	The practical implication is that the framework is better suited to continuous monitoring dashboards---tracking cumulative trend shifts across many generations---than to single-point threshold alarms.
61	If contamination grows over time (as in realistic web-scale data pipelines), the canary signal will strengthen as $\alpha$ increases, providing earlier detection than post-hoc quality audits.
62	
63	\paragraph{Token entropy versus perplexity.}
64	The finding that token entropy Granger-precedes diversity while perplexity does not ($F{\approx}0$, $p{=}0.99$ after differencing) requires clarification, since perplexity is the exponential of cross-entropy and appears mathematically related to token entropy.
65	The distinction lies in the evaluation domain: our ``token entropy'' is $H(p_\theta | \text{context})$ evaluated on \emph{held-out real data}---measuring the model's predictive uncertainty on genuine text---while ``perplexity'' is $\exp(H_\text{cross})$ evaluated on \emph{model-generated text}---measuring the model's self-consistency on its own outputs.
66	The identity $\text{ppl} = \exp(\text{entropy})$ holds only when the model distribution equals the data distribution, a condition that iterative collapse systematically violates.
67	In practice, both metrics trend downward during collapse (the model becomes more certain), producing high undifferenced correlation.
68	First-differencing removes this shared trend: the canary$\to$diversity channel survives because entropy \emph{leads} diversity decline by one generation (the model narrows its distribution before output diversity measurably falls), whereas the canary$\to$perplexity channel vanishes because entropy and perplexity co-move \emph{synchronously}---both driven by the same underlying distributional contraction.
69	Thus, the perplexity channel being ``spurious'' is not trivially expected from the mathematical relationship, but rather a substantive finding about collapse dynamics: the generation-evaluation divergence breaks the entropy--perplexity coupling in a temporally informative way.
70	
71	\paragraph{NLP-specific constraints on lead-lag analysis.}
72	Our application of Granger-type methods to iterative training faces constraints absent in their original econometric settings.
73	First, observation length: typical econometric applications use $T{=}100$--$1000$ time points, whereas iterative training studies are limited to $T{=}5$--$20$ generations due to computational cost.
74	This severely constrains degrees of freedom for VAR-based methods and explains the Toda--Yamamoto procedure's poor power in our setting.
75	Second, non-stationarity is by design: each generation's training data differs from the previous generation's, making the underlying process non-stationary by construction rather than as an incidental property.
76	Standard stationarity tests (ADF, KPSS) may yield misleading results when applied to processes with deterministic degradation trajectories rather than stochastic unit roots.
77	Third, the sample-size bottleneck compounds with multiple testing: with only 8--32 pairs per regime, FDR correction operates on small multiplicity, limiting its ability to separate true from false discoveries.
78	These constraints motivate our multi-method consensus approach as a complement to---rather than replacement for---traditional significance testing.
79	
80	\paragraph{Future work.}
81	Several directions extend this work.
82	Multivariate VAR models would enable testing for confounders and multi-directional Granger relationships beyond our current bivariate framework.
83	Cross-architecture validation beyond our preliminary single-seed GPT-2-medium result requires multi-seed replication; evaluation on larger-scale models would further test generalizability.
84	Online monitoring---integrating canary metrics into training pipelines for real-time collapse detection---is a natural applied extension.
85	Accumulate-mode experiments~\cite{dey2024breaking} would test whether canary dynamics differ from the replace-mode setting studied here.
86	Finally, connecting the empirically observed detectability boundary at $\alpha{\approx}0.50$--$0.75$ to theoretical phase transition analysis~\cite{truong2025entropy} could yield a principled explanation for why canary signals emerge at this contamination regime rather than at lower contamination levels.

effective rank decreases (representational contraction), consistent with mode collapse concentrating the output distribution into fewer dimensions.\nIn GPT-2-medium at $\\alpha{=}0.25$, effective rank \\emph{increases} from 2.37 to 8.48 (+258\\%).% provenance: gen_wiki_gpt2m_a025_s42\nThe likely explanation is starting-point dependence: GPT-2-medium begins near rank-2 (a highly concentrated initial representation), and iterative training disperses activation mass across more dimensions rather than concentrating it further.\nThis finding demonstrates that effective rank cannot serve as a direction-agnostic canary and that its trajectory must be interpreted relative to architecture-specific baselines.\nWe note this as a caveat on the generality of representational metrics as collapse indicators, even when the regime map (Table~\\ref{tab:cross_arch_regime}) and lead-lag detectability are consistent across architectures.\n\n\\paragraph{Diversity--calibration dissociation.}\nDiversity metrics and calibration metrics respond to synthetic contamination in qualitatively opposite directions across the $\\alpha$ spectrum.\nDiversity collapse (distinct-$n$ decline) is most severe at low contamination ($\\alpha{=}0.25$: distinct-3 declines by $58.9{\\pm}0.9\\%$) and attenuates at higher levels ($\\alpha{=}1.0$: $-30.5\\%$), while calibration degradation (ECE) increases monotonically with $\\alpha$ ($+51.7\\%$ at $\\alpha{=}0.0$ to $+3780\\%$ at $\\alpha{=}1.0$).\nThis dissociation underscores the need for multi-method consensus: the regime in which a metric degrades most severely ($\\alpha{=}0.25$ for diversity) does not coincide with the regime in which its temporal lead is most detectable ($\\alpha{\\geq}0.75$), and a single metric family cannot capture the full picture of iterative training degradation.\n\n\\paragraph{Practical utility paradox.}\nThe canary framework exhibits a paradox: it works best where it is least needed.\nAt $\\alpha{\\geq}0.75$, token entropy reliably Granger-precedes diversity collapse---but at these contamination levels, degradation is already severe and likely detectable through simpler means.\nAt $\\alpha{\\leq}0.50$, where early warning would be most valuable, the canary signal is undetectable by any method tested.\nThis is not a framework deficiency but an inherent characteristic of collapse dynamics: at low contamination, diversity changes are too small relative to inter-generation noise for any temporal lead to emerge above the statistical detection floor~\\cite{boettiger2012limits}.\nThe practical implication is that the framework is better suited to continuous monitoring dashboards---tracking cumulative trend shifts across many generations---than to single-point threshold alarms.\nIf contamination grows over time (as in realistic web-scale data pipelines), the canary signal will strengthen as $\\alpha$ increases, providing earlier detection than post-hoc quality audits.\n\n\\paragraph{Token entropy versus perplexity.}\nThe finding that token entropy Granger-precedes diversity while perplexity does not ($F{\\approx}0$, $p{=}0.99$ after differencing) requires clarification, since perplexity is the exponential of cross-entropy and appears mathematically related to token entropy.\nThe distinction lies in the evaluation domain: our ``token entropy'' is $H(p_\\theta | \\text{context})$ evaluated on \\emph{held-out real data}---measuring the model's predictive uncertainty on genuine text---while ``perplexity'' is $\\exp(H_\\text{cross})$ evaluated on \\emph{model-generated text}---measuring the model's self-consistency on its own outputs.\nThe identity $\\text{ppl} = \\exp(\\text{entropy})$ holds only when the model distribution equals the data distribution, a condition that iterative collapse systematically violates.\nIn practice, both metrics trend downward during collapse (the model becomes more certain), producing high undifferenced correlation.\nFirst-differencing removes this shared trend: the canary$\\to$diversity channel survives because entropy \\emph{leads} diversity decline by one generation (the model narrows its distribution before output diversity measurably falls), whereas the canary$\\to$perplexity channel vanishes because entropy and perplexity co-move \\emph{synchronously}---both driven by the same underlying distributional contraction.\nThus, the perplexity channel being ``spurious'' is not trivially expected from the mathematical relationship, but rather a substantive finding about collapse dynamics: the generation-evaluation divergence breaks the entropy--perplexity coupling in a temporally informative way.\n\n\\paragraph{NLP-specific constraints on lead-lag analysis.}\nOur application of Granger-type methods to iterative training faces constraints absent in their original econometric settings.\nFirst, observation length: typical econometric applications use $T{=}100$--$1000$ time points, whereas iterative training studies are limited to $T{=}5$--$20$ generations due to computational cost.\nThis severely constrains degrees of freedom for VAR-based methods and explains the Toda--Yamamoto procedure's poor power in our setting.\nSecond, non-stationarity is by design: each generation's training data differs from the previous generation's, making the underlying process non-stationary by construction rather than as an incidental property.\nStandard stationarity tests (ADF, KPSS) may yield misleading results when applied to processes with deterministic degradation trajectories rather than stochastic unit roots.\nThird, the sample-size bottleneck compounds with multiple testing: with only 8--32 pairs per regime, FDR correction operates on small multiplicity, limiting its ability to separate true from false discoveries.\nThese constraints motivate our multi-method consensus approach as a complement to---rather than replacement for---traditional significance testing.\n\n\\paragraph{Future work.}\nSeveral directions extend this work.\nMultivariate VAR models would enable testing for confounders and multi-directional Granger relationships beyond our current bivariate framework.\nCross-architecture validation beyond our preliminary single-seed GPT-2-medium result requires multi-seed replication; evaluation on larger-scale models would further test generalizability.\nOnline monitoring---integrating canary metrics into training pipelines for real-time collapse detection---is a natural applied extension.\nAccumulate-mode experiments~\\cite{dey2024breaking} would test whether canary dynamics differ from the replace-mode setting studied here.\nFinally, connecting the empirically observed detectability boundary at $\\alpha{\\approx}0.50$--$0.75$ to theoretical phase transition analysis~\\cite{truong2025entropy} could yield a principled explanation for why canary signals emerge at this contamination regime rather than at lower contamination levels.",

2	\label{sec:introduction}
3	
4	Training language models on their own output across successive generations leads to progressive distribution degradation, a phenomenon variously termed model collapse~\cite{shumailov2024curse} or Model Autophagy Disorder~\cite{alemohammad2024mad}.
5	Tail modes vanish, lexical diversity narrows, and calibration deteriorates as each generation's output becomes the next generation's training data.
6	As large language models become ubiquitous content generators, the fraction of machine-generated text on the web grows steadily, making iterative training collapse---where models are unwittingly trained on the output of earlier model generations---a practical concern for the long-term stability of language model ecosystems.
7	
8	A natural follow-up question is whether cheap-to-compute statistics---\emph{canary metrics}---can provide early warning of impending collapse, analogous to early-warning signals for critical transitions in ecological and climate systems~\cite{scheffer2009early,scheffer2012anticipating}.
9	Several recent studies have pursued this direction: \citet{du2026geometric} informally observe that expected calibration error rises before accuracy degrades; SIGMA~\cite{sigma2026spectral} proposes spectral indicators of distributional shift; and DCES~\cite{dces2026counter} uses center-edge sampling dynamics as a collapse signal.
10	Yet the statistical methodology underlying these lead-lag claims---whether a canary metric genuinely \emph{precedes} downstream degradation, or merely correlates with it under shared non-stationary trends---has received little scrutiny.
11	
12	We identify several methodological deficiencies that pervade existing lead-lag analyses of iterative training collapse:
13	(1)~no differencing tests to rule out spurious regression arising from shared non-stationary trends---a well-known hazard when correlating co-trending time series;
14	(2)~no multi-method cross-validation---conclusions rest on a single statistical method whose implicit assumptions about stationarity and directionality are rarely examined;
15	(3)~no multiple comparison correction (e.g., Benjamini--Hochberg FDR control), increasing the risk of false discoveries when testing many metric pairs simultaneously; and
16	(4)~no regime-dependent analysis, despite the possibility that the same statistical test yields opposite conclusions at different contamination levels.
17	The closest predecessor is \citet{du2026geometric}, who observe that calibration error rises before accuracy degrades in iteratively trained language models.
18	Their analysis, however, is limited to a single metric pair, spans only 1--3 generations, and reports informal visual comparisons without statistical tests---leaving open the question of whether the observed lead is genuine or an artifact of shared trends.
19	The early-warning framework of \citet{scheffer2009early,scheffer2012anticipating}---widely adopted in ecology for anticipating tipping points---provides the theoretical motivation for canary-based prediction, but has not been systematically applied to iterative training collapse with the methodological rigor that short, noisy time series demand~\cite{boettiger2012limits}.
20	
21	We address these gaps through a systematic case study of canary prediction of diversity collapse---the progressive loss of lexical diversity in model-generated text across training generations.
22	Using Pythia-410M across five contamination levels ($\alpha \in \{0.00, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1.00\}$) and up to four random seeds, we expose three methodological pitfalls that undermine naive lead-lag analysis:
23	\begin{enumerate}
24	    \item \textbf{Method sensitivity.} Applied to the same data (16 candidate canary$\to$downstream pairs, including candidates later excluded; \S\ref{sec:case_study}), five lead-lag detection methods yield FDR significance rates ranging from 100\% (naive cross-correlation) to 25\% (Toda--Yamamoto Granger causality), with inter-method agreement of Cohen's $\kappa{=}0.185$ (poor agreement).
25	    \item \textbf{Spurious regression.} Canary$\to$perplexity associations appear near-universal in undifferenced analysis but vanish entirely after first-differencing ($F{\approx}0$, $p{=}0.99$), revealing them as artifacts of co-trending rather than genuine temporal precedence.
26	    \item \textbf{Regime dependence.} Permutation Granger tests find 24/24 canary$\to$diversity pairs FDR-significant at full synthetic replacement ($\alpha{=}1.0$) but 0/8 at $\alpha{\leq}0.50$, demonstrating that detectability depends sharply on the contamination level.
27	\end{enumerate}
28	To move beyond single-method analysis, we propose a multi-method consensus framework with empirically calibrated thresholds, requiring agreement across multiple independent statistical methods and random seeds before classifying a lead-lag relationship as robust.
29	
30	The framework's utility is demonstrated by its calibration on built-in experimental controls.
31	Naive cross-correlation identifies 100\% of canary--collapse metric pairs as FDR-significant; the consensus pipeline (requiring ${\geq}4/5$ methods and ${\geq}3/4$ seeds) retains only those pairs meeting effect-size criteria calibrated against the null control.
32	On reference extremes, the framework achieves a false positive rate of 0\% at the $\alpha{=}0.0$ null control (single seed) (where individual methods reach up to 100\% FPR) and a false negative rate of 0\% against six effect-size reference pairs at $\alpha{=}1.0$.
33	Applying the framework, we identify token entropy as a one-generation-ahead canary for diversity collapse at $\alpha{=}1.0$, validated by the full consensus pipeline, with cross-correlation $|r|{>}0.99$ and directional asymmetry confirmed by 0/24 reverse-direction FDR-significant pairs; three-seed directional replication at $\alpha{=}0.75$ confirms asymmetry (19/24 forward, 0/24 reverse via permutation Granger), while method-level consensus remains in the transitional regime (Tier~2--3), consistent with a detectability boundary at $\alpha{\approx}0.50$--$0.75$.
34	We note that Granger precedence establishes temporal predictive improvement, not true causality~\cite{shojaie2022granger}.
35	
36	Our contributions are:
37	\begin{enumerate}
38	    \item \textbf{Systematic exposure of three methodological pitfalls} (method sensitivity, spurious regression, regime dependence) in lead-lag analysis of iterative training collapse.
39	    Method choice alone inflates spurious-signal rates to at least 62.5\%; first-differencing eliminates canary$\to$perplexity associations entirely; and the same Granger test shifts from 24/24 FDR-significant pairs to 0/8 across contamination levels.
40	    These results demonstrate that single-method, single-regime analyses---the current norm in this literature---are unreliable.
41	
42	    \item \textbf{A multi-method consensus framework} that instantiates known statistical methods in a novel sequential pipeline with empirical calibration, achieving FNR${=}$0\% on effect-size reference pairs (4-method panel, permutation Granger power${=}1.0$) with four-tier practical guidance.
43	
44	    \item \textbf{Identification of token entropy as a robust one-generation-ahead canary} for diversity collapse at $\alpha{\geq}0.75$, confirmed by 4 independent methods, 4 seeds, and cross-architecture replication on GPT-2-medium, with complete directional asymmetry (24/24 forward, 0/24 reverse). The claim is scoped to diversity metrics (distinct-$n$), not model collapse broadly.
45	\end{enumerate}
46	
47	The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.
48	\S\ref{sec:related_work} surveys related work on model collapse, early-warning signals, and lead-lag methodology.
49	\S\ref{sec:background} establishes the formal setup, notation, and the five detection methods used throughout.
50	\S\ref{sec:method} distills the three methodological pitfalls into a unified diagnostic framework, presents the multi-method consensus pipeline, and reports its empirical calibration.
51	\S\ref{sec:experiments} provides full experimental results: method sensitivity analysis (\S\ref{sec:method_sensitivity}), regime-dependent detectability (\S\ref{sec:regime}), a case study of canary prediction of diversity collapse (\S\ref{sec:case_study}), and consensus framework validation (\S\ref{sec:consensus_validation}).
52	\S\ref{sec:discussion} discusses implications---including the practical utility paradox, the token entropy--perplexity distinction, and NLP-specific constraints on lead-lag analysis---and outlines directions for future work.
53	\S\ref{sec:conclusion} concludes, followed by a dedicated Limitations section (\S\ref{sec:limitations}).

7	\subsection{Experimental Setup}
8	\label{sec:setup}
9	
10	We study lead-lag analysis pitfalls in iterative training collapse using Pythia-410M \cite{biderman2023pythia}, a 410M-parameter decoder-only language model.
11	Pythia provides a controlled setting: small enough for multi-seed experiments across five contamination levels, yet large enough to exhibit meaningful generation-over-generation degradation.
12	Cross-architecture validation uses GPT-2-medium (345M parameters, also decoder-only), a second transformer family of similar scale; results are reported in \S\ref{sec:method_sensitivity}, \S\ref{sec:regime}, and \S\ref{sec:discussion}.
13	Training data is drawn from WikiText-103 \cite{merity2017pointer}, using 5{,}000-sample subsets per generation.
14	
15	Our protocol follows the replace paradigm of \citet{shumailov2024curse}, adapted for mixed synthetic-real training at $\alpha{<}1.0$.
16	Each generation $t$ proceeds in three steps: (1)~fine-tune the generation-$(t{-}1)$ model for 5{,}000 steps on a mixture of $\alpha$ fraction synthetic data and $(1{-}\alpha)$ fraction real data (AdamW optimizer, learning rate $5 \times 10^{-5}$, 500 warmup steps, weight decay $0.01$, batch size 4 for Pythia-410M, 32 for GPT-2-medium); (2)~generate 5{,}000 synthetic samples from the fine-tuned model (temperature $1.0$, top-$k{=}50$, max length 512 tokens); (3)~fully replace the synthetic pool.
17	We run $T{=}10$ generations (11 time points including the generation-0 baseline) across contamination levels $\alpha \in \{0.00, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1.00\}$.
18	The $\alpha{=}1.0$ condition uses four random seeds $\{42, 43, 44, 45\}$; $\alpha{=}0.75$ and $\alpha{=}0.25$ each use three seeds $\{42, 43, 44\}$; other conditions use seed~42.
19	
20	We track two \emph{canary metrics}---cheap-to-compute statistics hypothesized to precede downstream degradation, inspired by early-warning signals in dynamical systems \cite{scheffer2009early}---and three \emph{downstream metrics}.
21	Canary metrics are token entropy (next-token prediction entropy averaged over held-out samples) and expected calibration error (ECE).
22	Downstream metrics are distinct-1 and distinct-2 ($n$-gram diversity \cite{li2016diversity}, computed over all 5{,}000 generated samples per generation) and perplexity (evaluated on held-out real data).
23	Token entropy is the mean next-token prediction entropy $H(p_\theta | \text{context})$ averaged over 1{,}000 held-out samples; ECE uses 15 equal-width bins.
24	We additionally evaluate effective rank and Self-BLEU as candidate canaries (\S\ref{sec:case_study}).
25	Results for distinct-3 are reported in Appendix~\ref{app:distinct3}.
26	Code and data will be released upon publication.
27	
28	All hypothesis tests apply Benjamini--Hochberg (BH) FDR correction at $q{=}0.05$.
29	Permutation Granger causality tests use 5{,}000 permutations on first-differenced series \cite{shojaie2022granger}.
30	Cross-correlation analysis uses a maximum lag of 5 generations.
31	Table~\ref{tab:drift_summary} summarizes raw metric drift from generation~0 to generation~10 across all five contamination levels.

52	\subsection{Method Sensitivity Analysis}
53	\label{sec:method_sensitivity}
54	
55	We open with Claim~3---method sensitivity---because it conditions the interpretation of all subsequent results.
56	If different statistical methods yield contradictory conclusions on the same data, any single-method analysis is unreliable by construction.
57	
58	\paragraph{Five-method ablation.}
59	We apply five lead-lag detection methods to the $\alpha{=}1.0$ condition (4~seeds, 16 canary$\to$downstream pairs).
60	The fraction of pairs reaching BH-corrected FDR significance varies dramatically by method: naive cross-correlation \textbf{16/16} (100\%), differenced cross-correlation \textbf{14/16} (87.5\%), threshold onset detection \textbf{9/16} (56.3\%), permutation Granger causality \textbf{6/16} (37.5\%), and Toda--Yamamoto Granger \textbf{4/16} (25.0\%).
61	Method choice alone swings significance from \textbf{100\% to 25\%}: 50--57\% of pairs classified as significant under one method flip to non-significant under another.
62	The spurious-signal rate---the fraction of pairs detected by the most liberal method but not confirmed by the most conservative---is \textbf{75\%} across all five methods and \textbf{62.5\%} when excluding Toda--Yamamoto, whose low statistical power at $T{=}10$ inflates this rate (\S\ref{sec:consensus_validation}).
63	Table~\ref{tab:method_comparison} reports significance rates restricted to 8 validated canary$\to$downstream pairs (excluding failed candidates); the 16-pair rates above include effective rank and Self-BLEU to capture the full method-sensitivity landscape.
64	
65	\paragraph{First-differencing diagnostic.}
66	A single preprocessing decision can eliminate an entire analysis channel.
67	For canary$\to$diversity pairs at $\alpha{=}1.0$, all pairs retain unanimous FDR significance after first-differencing (24/24$\to$24/24), confirming genuine temporal precedence rather than shared-trend confounding.
68	For canary$\to$perplexity, however, undifferenced tests find near-universal significance ($F{=}16$--$36$) while differenced tests find \textbf{zero} significant pairs ($F{\approx}0$, $p{=}0.99$; Figure~\ref{fig:differencing_dmax}a).
69	The apparent canary$\to$perplexity relationship is entirely an artifact of co-trending.
70	Notably, at $\alpha{=}0.75$, differenced cross-correlation finds 8/8 pairs significant in \emph{both} forward and reverse directions per seed, demonstrating that this method alone cannot distinguish genuine directional precedence from shared dynamics even after detrending.
71	
72	\paragraph{Augmentation order sensitivity.}
73	Toda--Yamamoto Granger tests show extreme sensitivity to the augmentation order $d_{\max}$ (Figure~\ref{fig:differencing_dmax}b).
74	At $d_{\max}{=}0$ (most permissive), approximately 6\% of pairs are rejected; at adaptive $d_{\max}$ determined by ADF unit-root tests, 75\%; at $d_{\max}{=}1$ (most conservative), \textbf{94\%}.
75	This single hyperparameter swings conclusions from near-universal significance to near-universal non-significance.
76

80	\caption{First-differencing diagnostic and augmentation order sensitivity (Pythia-410M, $\alpha{=}1.0$, 4~seeds). \textbf{(a)}~First-differencing eliminates the canary$\to$perplexity channel: undifferenced tests find near-universal significance ($F{=}16$--$36$) while differenced tests find zero significant pairs ($F{\approx}0$, $p{=}0.99$), exposing these associations as shared-trend artifacts. Canary$\to$diversity pairs retain significance after differencing (24/24$\to$24/24). \textbf{(b)}~Toda--Yamamoto Granger significance rates vary dramatically with augmentation order $d_{\max}$: from $\sim$6\% rejection at $d_{\max}{=}0$ to 94\% at $d_{\max}{=}1$, demonstrating that this single hyperparameter can reverse conclusions about temporal precedence.}
81	\label{fig:differencing_dmax}
82	\end{figure}
83	
84	\paragraph{Inter-method agreement.}
85	Cohen's $\kappa$, averaged over all method pairs, is \textbf{0.185} (near chance; poor agreement); this value is consistent across contamination levels ($\alpha{=}0.0$ through $\alpha{=}1.0$), indicating that method disagreement is a structural property of the analysis rather than a regime-specific artifact.
86	Cross-architecture validation on GPT-2-medium (12 canary$\to$downstream pairs) yields Fleiss' $\kappa{=}0.091$, also in the ``slight agreement'' range, confirming that low inter-method agreement is not architecture-specific.
87	Restricting to three informative methods (excluding naive cross-correlation and Toda--Yamamoto, which anchor the permissive and conservative extremes respectively) raises $\kappa$ to 0.667 (substantial agreement), indicating that the low full-panel $\kappa$ is driven by the deliberate inclusion of methods spanning the entire permissive-to-conservative spectrum rather than by fundamental incoherence among methods.
88	Table~\ref{tab:method_comparison} extends the analysis across contamination levels.
89	At $\alpha{=}0.0$ (no synthetic data, serving as null control), naive cross-correlation finds \textbf{100\%} of pairs significant---a textbook spurious-regression outcome in trending time series.
90	Permutation Granger and Toda--Yamamoto correctly find 0\%.
91	At $\alpha{=}0.50$, correlation-based methods (naive, differenced, threshold) unanimously find significance while causal methods unanimously find non-significance (Figure~\ref{fig:consensus_heatmap}), the most extreme method$\times$regime divergence in our experiments.
92	
93	\paragraph{Method$\times$regime interaction.}
94	Table~\ref{tab:method_comparison} reveals that the correlation-versus-causal divergence is not uniform across contamination levels.
95	At $\alpha{=}0.25$, differenced cross-correlation drops to 25\% and threshold onset to 37.5\%, while naive cross-correlation remains at 100\%---demonstrating that even partial detrending removes marginal associations at low contamination.
96	In low-contamination regimes ($\alpha{\leq}0.50$), the false confirmation rate for the most liberal method approaches 100\%, while all Granger-type tests correctly find 0\%---a regime where single-method analysis is maximally dangerous.
97	The graded response across methods, combined with the block structure visible in Figure~\ref{fig:consensus_heatmap}, motivates the regime-dependent analysis in \S\ref{sec:regime}.

125	\subsection{Regime-Dependent Detectability}
126	\label{sec:regime}
127	
128	Beyond method choice, the contamination level~$\alpha$ determines whether a temporal lead exists to detect.
129	We present regime effects at two levels: raw metric drift (method-independent) and Granger-precedence detectability.
130	
131	\paragraph{Raw drift.}
132	Table~\ref{tab:drift_summary} shows that diversity collapse occurs at \emph{all} contamination levels, not only under full synthetic replacement.
133	Distinct-1 declines by 13.8\% even at $\alpha{=}0.0$ (attributable to fine-tuning on repeated real-data subsets), and more steeply at intermediate contamination: $-40.3{\pm}0.3\%$ ($\alpha{=}0.25$), $-37.3\%$ ($\alpha{=}0.50$), $-32.3{\pm}0.5\%$ ($\alpha{=}0.75$), and $-27.8{\pm}1.6\%$ ($\alpha{=}1.0$).
134	The non-monotonic pattern---diversity declining \emph{more} at moderate~$\alpha$ than at extreme~$\alpha$---is confirmed by 3-seed replication at $\alpha{=}0.25$ (std${=}0.3\%$), indicating that this relationship between contamination level and collapse severity is robust rather than a seed-specific artifact.
135	
136	\begin{figure}[t]
137	\centering
138	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/regime_map.pdf}
139	\caption{Detectability regime map across contamination levels (Pythia-410M). Permutation Granger FDR significance rate (solid line) and consensus tier (shaded regions) as a function of $\alpha$. A sharp detectability transition occurs between $\alpha{=}0.50$ and $\alpha{=}0.75$: below this range, no Granger-type method achieves significance (0/24+ tests); within it, directional asymmetry emerges (19/24 forward, 0/24 reverse, 3~seeds) but method consensus remains transitional (Tier~2--3); above it ($\alpha{=}1.0$), full Confirmatory consensus is achieved (24/24 forward, Tier~3, 4~seeds). Multi-seed replication: $\alpha{=}0.25$ and $\alpha{=}0.75$ use 3~seeds; $\alpha{=}1.0$ uses 4~seeds; other levels single seed.}
140	\label{fig:regime_map}
141	\end{figure}
142	
143	\paragraph{Granger-precedence detectability.}
144	Despite ubiquitous drift, causal detectability is sharply regime-dependent (Figure~\ref{fig:regime_map}).
145	Permutation Granger tests (first-differenced, BH-corrected) find 0/8 pairs FDR-significant at $\alpha{=}0.00$, 0/8 at $\alpha{=}0.25$, 0/8 at $\alpha{=}0.50$, and \textbf{6/8} at $\alpha{=}1.0$ in the cross-$\alpha$ pooled analysis.
146	At $\alpha{=}0.75$ (3~seeds), permutation Granger finds 19/24 forward-direction pairs FDR-significant with 0/24 reverse, confirming directional asymmetry; however, method-level consensus varies by seed (Tier~3 pairs: 4, 3, and 1 across seeds), placing this regime in a transitional detection state.
147	Under Bonferroni correction, approximately 3/8 pairs per seed survive---consistent with the transitional nature of the $\alpha{=}0.75$ boundary where marginal signals are sensitive to correction stringency.
148	Within-$\alpha$ multi-seed analysis at $\alpha{=}1.0$ yields \textbf{24/24} canary$\to$diversity pairs FDR-significant across all four seeds, with 0/24 in the reverse direction, confirming temporal asymmetry.
149	The detectability boundary---the regime below which canary metrics no longer develop sufficient temporal lead for causal inference---lies at $\alpha \approx 0.50$--$0.75$, consistent with theoretical expectations about signal-to-noise limits in short time series \cite{boettiger2012limits}.
150	A detectability transition exists between $\alpha{=}0.50$ and $\alpha{=}0.75$: below this range, no method achieves FDR-corrected significance (0/24+ tests); within it, directional asymmetry emerges robustly (19/24 forward, 0/24 reverse) but method consensus remains transitional (Tier~2--3); above it ($\alpha{=}1.0$), full Confirmatory consensus is achieved (24/24 forward, Tier~3 across 4~seeds).
151	This seed-dependent variability at $\alpha{=}0.75$ is a feature, not a limitation: it maps the boundary region where individual-seed stochasticity determines whether the consensus threshold is crossed.
152	Cross-architecture validation on GPT-2-medium confirms this boundary: at $\alpha{=}0.25$, at most 1/8 pairs reach Confirmatory consensus ($K{\geq}4/5$)---consistent with the null regime---despite substantially stronger canary drift (entropy $-32.8\%$ vs.\ Pythia $-4.7{\pm}0.5\%$), while at $\alpha{=}1.0$ all 6 canary$\to$diversity pairs reach $K{\geq}4/5$ (\S\ref{sec:discussion}).
153	Table~\ref{tab:cross_arch_regime} summarizes the regime map across both architectures.
154	At $\alpha{=}0.25$, GPT-2-medium yields 1/8 pairs at Tier~3 ($K{\geq}4/5$) and 7/8 at Tier~2 ($K{\geq}3/5$)---consistent with Pythia's 0/8 Tier~3, 0/8 Tier~2 result at the same contamination level, placing both architectures in the null/low-detectability regime.% provenance: gen_wiki_gpt2m_a025_s42

174	\paragraph{Synchronous collapse at $\alpha{=}0.50$.}
175	The $\alpha{=}0.50$ regime provides particularly informative evidence.
176	Correlation-based methods unanimously find significance (Table~\ref{tab:method_comparison}) while causal methods unanimously find non-significance.
177	This extreme method$\times$regime interaction arises because canary and downstream metrics collapse \emph{synchronously} at moderate contamination, preserving high correlation but eliminating the temporal lead required for Granger-precedence inference.
178	We highlight this as a \emph{positive finding}: it delineates the regime boundary where naive analysis is most dangerous---high correlation coexists with zero causal precedence, maximizing the risk of spurious conclusions.
179	Figure~\ref{fig:consensus_heatmap} visualizes this interaction across all method$\times\alpha$ combinations, revealing a clear block structure that separates correlation-based methods from causal methods as a function of regime.

182	\subsection{Case Study: Canary Prediction of Diversity Collapse}
183	\label{sec:case_study}
184	
185	Having established method sensitivity (Claim~3) and regime dependence (Claim~2), we present the conditions under which canary prediction succeeds (Claim~1).
186	We scope this claim precisely: canary metrics predict \emph{diversity collapse} (declining distinct-$n$), not model collapse broadly.
187	
188	\paragraph{Full synthetic replacement ($\alpha{=}1.0$, 4 seeds).}
189	Token entropy exhibits robust Granger-precedence over diversity collapse metrics, confirmed by 4 independent statistical methods (permutation Granger power${=}1.0$), 4 seeds, and cross-architecture replication on GPT-2-medium (Tier~3 consensus; \S\ref{sec:discussion}).
190	Cross-correlation peaks at lag$={+}1$ with $|r|{>}0.99$ (cross-seed standard deviation: 0.0), establishing a consistent one-generation lead.
191	Figure~\ref{fig:metric_trajectory} illustrates the one-generation offset between token entropy decline and distinct-1 decline, visible across all four seeds.
192	Permutation Granger tests (first-differenced) confirm all canary$\to$diversity pairs as FDR-significant across all four seeds, including distinct-3 (Appendix~\ref{app:distinct3}).
193	Reverse-direction tests (downstream$\to$canary) find \textbf{0/24} FDR-significant (all $p{>}0.49$), establishing complete directional asymmetry.

Token entropy (top, blue) drops sharply at generation~1, while distinct-1 (bottom, red) begins declining at generations~2--3, establishing a visible one-generation canary lead. The consistent lag across all four seeds confirms that the temporal offset is robust rather than seed-specific. Shaded bands show the inter-seed range. This visual pattern corresponds to the statistical finding of 24/24 forward-direction and 0/24 reverse-direction FDR-significant pairs.}

202	\paragraph{High contamination ($\alpha{=}0.75$, 3 seeds).}
203	Directional asymmetry is robustly confirmed across three independent seeds (permutation Granger: 19/24 forward pairs FDR-significant, 0/24 reverse).
204	However, method-level consensus varies by seed (Tier~3 pairs: 4, 3, and 1 across seeds 42, 43, 44), placing $\alpha{=}0.75$ squarely in the transitional detection regime.
205	Differenced cross-correlation finds 8/8 pairs significant in \emph{both} forward and reverse directions at each seed, confirming that this method alone cannot distinguish genuine directional precedence from shared dynamics---a seed-level demonstration of Pitfall~1 (\S\ref{sec:pitfalls}).
206	
207	\paragraph{ECE as a conditional secondary canary.}
208	ECE performs equivalently to token entropy across four of five methods (naive, differenced, threshold, permutation Granger).
209	Its classification as ``secondary'' is driven entirely by Toda--Yamamoto Type~II errors at $T{=}10$, where bootstrap power analysis yields estimated power of 0.05--0.20 depending on $d_{\max}$.
210	Resolving ECE's true canary status requires longer time series.
211	
212	\paragraph{Failed canary candidates.}
213	Not all metrics serve as canaries.
214	Effective rank and Self-BLEU show no detectable lead-lag relationship with any downstream metric under any method or contamination level, and are excluded from the consensus framework.
215	Effective rank behavior is model-dependent in an unexpected way: in Pythia-410M, effective rank decreases during collapse (representational contraction), whereas in GPT-2-medium at $\alpha{=}0.25$ it \emph{increases} from 2.37 to 8.48 (+258\%).% provenance: gen_wiki_gpt2m_a025_s42
216	The GPT-2-medium starting effective rank is near rank-2, suggesting the model's initial representation is already highly concentrated; iterative training disperses it rather than concentrating it further.
217	This opposite directionality across architectures precludes effective rank as a universal canary and motivates architecture-specific analysis (\S\ref{sec:discussion}).
218	
219	\paragraph{Consensus filtering.}
220	Of 16 canary$\to$downstream pairs tested at $\alpha{=}1.0$ (4 candidate canaries $\times$ 4 downstream metrics), \textbf{6 survive} the full consensus pipeline ($K{\geq}4/5$ methods, $S{\geq}3/4$ seeds): token entropy and ECE each predicting distinct-1 and distinct-2 (4 pairs; distinct-3 results in Appendix~\ref{app:distinct3} bring the total to~6).
221	The 10 eliminated pairs comprise all canary$\to$perplexity relationships (identified as spurious by the first-differencing diagnostic) and all effective-rank and Self-BLEU pairs (failed canaries).
222	The consensus framework reduces the naive 100\% significance rate to the 37.5\% rate supported by the most conservative individual methods (Figure~\ref{fig:consensus_workflow}).
223	
224	
225	\subsection{Consensus Framework Validation}
226	\label{sec:consensus_validation}
227	
228	We validate the consensus framework's calibration using built-in experimental controls.
229	
230	\paragraph{False positive rate.}
231	At $\alpha{=}0.0$, no synthetic data is injected; any detected lead-lag association is a false positive.
232	Individual-method FPR ranges from \textbf{100\%} (naive cross-correlation: 8/8 pairs) through 62.5\% (threshold) and 37.5\% (differenced) down to \textbf{0\%} (permutation Granger and Toda--Yamamoto).
233	The consensus framework at $K{\geq}4/5$ achieves \textbf{FPR${=}$0\%}, matching the best individual methods while providing robustness against miscalibration of any single method (Table~\ref{tab:fpr_fnr}).
234	
235	\paragraph{False negative rate.}
236	At $\alpha{=}1.0$, we define 6 effect-size reference pairs (token entropy and ECE $\to$ distinct-1/2/3) using criteria independent of the consensus methods: drift ratio ${\geq}3\times$ the $\alpha{=}0.0$ baseline (entropy $11.93\times$, ECE $73.12\times$) and canary onset strictly preceding downstream onset by ${\geq}1$ generation (\S\ref{sec:calibration}).
237	FNR is calibrated on a 4-method panel (excluding differenced cross-correlation to avoid circularity): at $K{\geq}3/4$, $S{\geq}3/4$, all~6 are recovered (\textbf{FNR${=}$0\%}).
238	Toda--Yamamoto alone yields FNR${=}$33.3\% (2/6), missing ECE$\to$distinct-2 and ECE$\to$distinct-3 due to Type~II errors at $T{=}10$.
239	We note a design asymmetry: FPR is validated on method-only data (single seed at $\alpha{=}0.0$), while FNR uses method$\times$seed joint data (4~seeds at $\alpha{=}1.0$).
240	Full joint calibration---multi-seed null-control experiments---remains future work.
241	Table~\ref{tab:fpr_fnr} reports the calibration results.
242	
243	\paragraph{Bootstrap power analysis.}
244	To quantify detection power beyond binary FNR, we perform bootstrap power analysis ($B{=}1{,}000$ resamples from 4-seed data at $\alpha{=}1.0$).
245	Permutation Granger achieves power${=}1.0$ on genuine pairs (canary$\to$diversity) and power${=}0.0$ on spurious pairs (canary$\to$perplexity), providing clean separation.
246	Toda--Yamamoto achieves power${=}0.05$--$0.20$ on genuine pairs (depending on $d_{\max}$), confirming its poor sensitivity at $T{=}10$.
247	We note that bootstrap power${=}1.0$ reflects the effect size in our 4-seed data and should not be interpreted as a universal power guarantee; furthermore, the two methods use different data-generating processes for calibration (permutation Granger resamples observed $\alpha{=}1.0$ trajectories, while Toda--Yamamoto power was estimated under a generic VAR(2) simulation with $\beta{=}0.3$).

````text
Now I need to make the following fixes:

**Must-fix 1: introduction.tex ~L44**
Current L44:
```
    \item \textbf{Identification of token entropy as a robust one-generation-ahead canary} for diversity collapse at $\alpha{\geq}0.75$, confirmed by 4 independent methods, 4 seeds, and cross-architecture replication on GPT-2-medium, with complete directional asymmetry (24/24 forward, 0/24 reverse). The claim is scoped to diversity metrics (distinct-$n$), not model collapse broadly.


```

This is conflating two different regimes. I need to separate the α=1.0 results (24/24 forward, 0/24 reverse with full methodological rigor) from the α=0.75 transitional case (19/24 forward, 0/24 reverse across 3 seeds), since they have different levels of evidence.

**Must-fix 2: experiments.tex ~L159**
Line 159:
```
\caption{Cross-architecture regime map: lead-lag consensus tier and metric drift at $\alpha{=}0.25$ and $\alpha{=}1.0$. Tier~3
```

This caption is incomplete and needs to specify what the figure actually shows about the regime boundaries and tier structure.

The LaTeX comment `% provenance: gen_wiki_gpt2m_a025_s42` is breaking the caption text—everything after it gets treated as a comment. I need to move that provenance note to its own line after the caption closes, or remove it entirely if it's not essential for the figure description.

I'm also noticing there are several other provenance comments scattered across experiments.tex and discussion.tex that should be cleaned up, along with some changelog comments at the top of those files that are cluttering the source.

For the table values, I need to verify the ECE measurement with α=0.75 showing ±18 against the registry to make sure that's accurate. Let me pull up the registry and check those numbers.

Now for the main fix in introduction.tex at line 44 — the current text about token entropy as a canary for diversity collapse is getting cut off mid-sentence. I need to see the complete statement to properly revise it.

Looking at what's there, the claim mentions 4 methods, 4 seeds, and 24/24 forward asymmetry, but those metrics don't align with α=0.75 — those numbers correspond to α=1.0 instead. At α=0.75, we're looking at 3 seeds and 19/24 forward. So I need to split this into two separate claims: one for α=1.0 with the full 4 seeds and 24/24 results, and another for α=0.75 with its own corresponding metrics.

For the caption issue, I'm removing the provenance comment that's embedded in the middle since we're cleaning those up anyway. The caption should just state the core information about the regime map, the tier definitions, and what the drift measurement covers.

For the provenance comments scattered through the document, I need to strip those out systematically—they're cluttering the text and don't add value to the final output. Now I need to remove the 3-line changelog comments from discussion.tex as well, then check the registry to verify the ECE ±18 values before making all the edits.

```text
Let me check the ECE drift for α=0.75 across 3 seeds:
- s42: 1809.5
- s43: 1789
- s44: 1774

Mean = (1809.5 + 1789 + 1774) / 3 = 5372.5 / 3 = 1790.83
Std = sqrt(((1809.5-1790.83)^2 + (1789-1790.83)^2 + (1774-1790.83)^2) / 2) 


= sqrt((348.39 + 3.35 + 283.25) / 2) 
= sqrt(634.99 / 2) 
= sqrt(317.5)
= 17.82

So ±18 is correct (rounded from 17.82). Good, I'll keep it.

Now I need to plan out all the edits I want to make. I can tackle the independent ones in parallel. Let me start with the must-fix items, beginning with introduction.tex at line 44 where I need to shorten that bullet point about token entropy as a canary for diversity collapse.

The key change is updating the alpha threshold from 0.75 to 1.0 for the main claim, then adding detail about how directional asymmetry also holds at 0.75 across a smaller set of seeds with slightly lower forward rates. I'm compressing the language to fit this additional scope information more concisely while keeping all the validation details about the 4 methods, seeds, and cross-architecture confirmation. I'm going through the remaining cleanup tasks systematically—removing all those provenance comments scattered throughout the LaTeX files and stripping out the changelog entries at the top of both documents to get a cleaner final version.

    "originalFile": "\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{sec:introduction}\n\nTraining language models on their own output across successive generations leads to progressive distribution degradation, a phenomenon variously termed model collapse~\\cite{shumailov2024curse} or Model Autophagy Disorder~\\cite{alemohammad2024mad}.\nTail modes vanish, lexical diversity narrows, and calibration deteriorates as each generation's output becomes the next generation's training data.\nAs large language models become ubiquitous content generators, the fraction of machine-generated text on the web grows steadily, making iterative training collapse---where models are unwittingly trained on the output of earlier model generations---a practical concern for the long-term stability of language model ecosystems.\n\nA natural follow-up question is whether cheap-to-compute statistics---\\emph{canary metrics}---can provide early warning of impending collapse, analogous to early-warning signals for critical transitions in ecological and climate systems~\\cite{scheffer2009early,scheffer2012anticipating}.\nSeveral recent studies have pursued this direction: \\citet{du2026geometric} informally observe that expected calibration error rises before accuracy degrades; SIGMA~\\cite{sigma2026spectral} proposes spectral indicators of distributional shift; and DCES~\\cite{dces2026counter} uses center-edge sampling dynamics as a collapse signal.\nYet the statistical methodology underlying these lead-lag claims---whether a canary metric genuinely \\emph{precedes} downstream degradation, or merely correlates with it under shared non-stationary trends---has received little scrutiny.\n\nWe identify several methodological deficiencies that pervade existing lead-lag analyses of iterative training collapse:\n(1)~no differencing tests to rule out spurious regression arising from shared non-stationary trends---a well-known hazard when correlating co-trending time series;\n(2)~no multi-method cross-validation---conclusions rest on a single statistical method whose implicit assumptions about stationarity and directionality are rarely examined;\n(3)~no multiple comparison correction (e.g., Benjamini--Hochberg FDR control), increasing the risk of false discoveries when testing many metric pairs simultaneously; and\n(4)~no regime-dependent analysis, despite the possibility that the same statistical test yields opposite conclusions at different contamination levels.\nThe closest predecessor is \\citet{du2026geometric}, who observe that calibration error rises before accuracy degrades in iteratively trained language models.\nTheir analysis, however, is limited to a single metric pair, spans only 1--3 generations, and reports informal visual comparisons without statistical tests---leaving open the question of whether the observed lead is genuine or an artifact of shared trends.\nThe early-warning framework of \\citet{scheffer2009early,scheffer2012anticipating}---widely adopted in ecology for anticipating tipping points---provides the theoretical motivation for canary-based prediction, but has not been systematically applied to iterative training collapse with the methodological rigor that short, noisy time series demand~\\cite{boettiger2012limits}.\n\nWe address these gaps through a systematic case study of canary prediction of diversity collapse---the progressive loss of lexical diversity in model-generated text across training generations.\nUsing Pythia-410M across five contamination levels ($\\alpha \\in \\{0.00, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1.00\\}$) and up to four random seeds, we expose three methodological pitfalls that undermine naive lead-lag analysis:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item \\textbf{Method sensitivity.} Applied to the same data (16 candidate canary$\\to$downstream pairs, including candidates later excluded; \\S\\ref{sec:case_study}), five lead-lag detection methods yield FDR significance rates ranging from 100\\% (naive cross-correlation) to 25\\% (Toda--Yamamoto Granger causality), with inter-method agreement of Cohen's $\\kappa{=}0.185$ (poor agreement).\n    \\item \\textbf{Spurious regression.} Canary$\\to$perplexity associations appear near-universal in undifferenced analysis but vanish entirely after first-differencing ($F{\\approx}0$, $p{=}0.99$), revealing them as artifacts of co-trending rather than genuine temporal precedence.\n    \\item \\textbf{Regime dependence.} Permutation Granger tests find 24/24 canary$\\to$diversity pairs FDR-significant at full synthetic replacement ($\\alpha{=}1.0$) but 0/8 at $\\alpha{\\leq}0.50$, demonstrating that detectability depends sharply on the contamination level.\n\\end{enumerate}\nTo move beyond single-method analysis, we propose a multi-method consensus framework with empirically calibrated thresholds, requiring agreement across multiple independent statistical methods and random seeds before classifying a lead-lag relationship as robust.\n\nThe framework's utility is demonstrated by its calibration on built-in experimental controls.\nNaive cross-correlation identifies 100\\% of canary--collapse metric pairs as FDR-significant; the consensus pipeline (requiring ${\\geq}4/5$ methods and ${\\geq}3/4$ seeds) retains only those pairs meeting effect-size criteria calibrated against the null control.\nOn reference extremes, the framework achieves a false positive rate of 0\\% at the $\\alpha{=}0.0$ null control (single seed) (where individual methods reach up to 100\\% FPR) and a false negative rate of 0\\% against six effect-size reference pairs at $\\alpha{=}1.0$.\nApplying the framework, we identify token entropy as a one-generation-ahead canary for diversity collapse at $\\alpha{=}1.0$, validated by the full consensus pipeline, with cross-correlation $|r|{>}0.99$ and directional asymmetry confirmed by 0/24 reverse-direction FDR-significant pairs; three-seed directional replication at $\\alpha{=}0.75$ confirms asymmetry (19/24 forward, 0/24 reverse via permutation Granger), while method-level consensus remains in the transitional regime (Tier~2--3), consistent with a detectability boundary at $\\alpha{\\approx}0.50$--$0.75$.\nWe note that Granger precedence establishes temporal predictive improvement, not true causality~\\cite{shojaie2022granger}.\n\nOur contributions are:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item \\textbf{Systematic exposure of three methodological pitfalls} (method sensitivity, spurious regression, regime dependence) in lead-lag analysis of iterative training collapse.\n    Method choice alone inflates spurious-signal rates to at least 62.5\\%; first-differencing eliminates canary$\\to$perplexity associations entirely; and the same Granger test shifts from 24/24 FDR-significant pairs to 0/8 across contamination levels.\n    These results demonstrate that single-method, single-regime analyses---the current norm in this literature---are unreliable.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{A multi-method consensus framework} that instantiates known statistical methods in a novel sequential pipeline with empirical calibration, achieving FNR${=}$0\\% on effect-size reference pairs (4-method panel, permutation Granger power${=}1.0$) with four-tier practical guidance.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Identification of token entropy as a robust one-generation-ahead canary} for diversity collapse at $\\alpha{\\geq}0.75$, confirmed by 4 independent methods, 4 seeds, and cross-architecture replication on GPT-2-medium, with complete directional asymmetry (24/24 forward, 0/24 reverse). The claim is scoped to diversity metrics (distinct-$n$), not model collapse broadly.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows.\n\\S\\ref{sec:related_work} surveys related work on model collapse, early-warning signals, and lead-lag methodology.\n\\S\\ref{sec:background} establishes the formal setup, notation, and the five detection methods used throughout.\n\\S\\ref{sec:method} distills the three methodological pitfalls into a unified diagnostic framework, presents the multi-method consensus pipeline, and reports its empirical calibration.\n\\S\\ref{sec:experiments} provides full experimental results: method sensitivity analysis (\\S\\ref{sec:method_sensitivity}), regime-dependent detectability (\\S\\ref{sec:regime}), a case study of canary prediction of diversity collapse (\\S\\ref{sec:case_study}), and consensus framework validation (\\S\\ref{sec:consensus_validation}).\n\\S\\ref{sec:discussion} discusses implications---including the practical utility paradox, the token entropy--perplexity distinction, and NLP-specific constraints on lead-lag analysis---and outlines directions for future work.\n\\S\\ref{sec:conclusion} concludes, followed by a dedicated Limitations section (\\S\\ref{sec:limitations}).",

[Director 指令] [Patch] Reviewer proofread 新发现：GPT-2-medium "preliminary" underselling

3 处需修改：
- discussion.tex:18: "Preliminary cross-architecture validation on GPT-2-medium" → "Initial cross-architecture validation on GPT-2-medium"
- discussion.tex:83: "beyond our preliminary single-seed GPT-2-medium result" → "beyond our single-seed GPT-2-medium validation"
- limitations.tex:7: "preliminary cross-architecture validation uses GPT-2-medium" → "cross-architecture validation (single-seed GPT-2-medium)"

理由：GPT-2m α=1.0 已达 Tier 3 全面共识 (6/6 K≥4/5)，α=0.25 也有完整 drift profile。"preliminary" 暗示结果不可靠，审稿人可能攻击"自己都说 preliminary 为什么放正文"。改为中性描述，保留 "single-seed" 作为实际限制。

另外确认：must-fix #1 (intro L44 regime 拆分) 和 #2 (caption provenance 注释) 你上一轮是否已实际写入文件？Reviewer 第二轮仍报相同问题——可能是它读了旧版本，但请 double-check 确保修改已落盘。

Director wants:
1. Three "preliminary" → neutral wording changes
2. Double-check that must-fix #1 and #2 from last patch actually landed

Let me first verify the previous fixes landed, then make the 3 new edits.

Must-fix #2 (caption) is confirmed landed. 

For must-fix #1, the grep for `α{=}1.0$, confirmed by 4 independent methods` didn't match. Let me check what's actually in intro L44 now.

Wait, let me re-check the intro. The grep pattern might have issues with special characters. Let me check.

```text
14	For instance, architectures with different tokenizer granularity or training dynamics could shift the balance between false positive and false negative rates at these thresholds.
15	Preliminary cross-architecture validation on GPT-2-medium (single seed, $\alpha{=}1.0$) replicates the entropy-leads-diversity pattern at Tier~3 consensus: all 6 canary$\to$diversity pairs reach $K{\geq}4/5$ method agreement (permutation Granger $p_{\text{FDR}}{=}0.003$), with 0/6 reverse-direction pairs significant.
16	Full-panel inter-method agreement remains low (Fleiss' $\kappa{=}0.091$) but rises to $\kappa{=}0.667$ among the three informative methods (\S\ref{sec:method_sensitivity}), confirming that the consensus framework's structure transfers across architectures even if operating thresholds require architecture-specific calibration.
17	At $\alpha{=}0.25$, GPT-2-medium yields 1/8 pairs at Tier~3 consensus ($K{\geq}4/5$) and 7/8 at Tier~2 ($K{\geq}3/5$), placing it in the same null/low-detectability regime as Pythia (0/8 Tier~3) and confirming that the detectability boundary is consistent across two transformer decoder-only model families of similar scale.
18	The full GPT-2-medium drift profile at $\alpha{=}0.25$ is: entropy $-32.8\%$, ECE $+422\%$, perplexity $-44.5\%$, distinct-1 $-23.5\%$, distinct-2 $-31.6\%$, distinct-3 $-30.2\%$, MAUVE $0.0315 \to 0.0282$ ($-10.5\%$).
19	Compared to Pythia ($-4.7{\pm}0.5\%$ entropy, $-40.3{\pm}0.3\%$ distinct-1), GPT-2-medium shows substantially stronger canary drift but milder diversity decline---likely due to its $8\times$ larger batch size exposing more data per step.
20	The stronger canary signal approaches detectability (permutation Granger $F{=}64.09$, $p{=}0.081$ for entropy$\to$distinct-1, compared to $p{>}0.5$ in Pythia), suggesting that the regime boundary may shift with increased effective sample size, but single-seed $T{=}10$ power remains insufficient for Confirmatory claims.
21	Toda--Yamamoto Granger finds 1/8 pairs significant, consistent with its known instability at short series lengths (\S\ref{sec:consensus_validation}).

[Director 指令] [Patch] a000 null control 三 seed 完成 — 最终数据整合

α=0.0 三 seed 结果（R1-N2 彻底关闭）：
- 5-method consensus FPR = 0/24（三 seed 均为 0/8 robust pairs）
- Perm Granger: 0/24 FDR-sig
- TY: 1/24（s43 df_resid=1 退化，per C003 不可靠）
- 跨 seed drift std < 1%

需要修改：
1. **Abstract**: "FPR=0%" 改为 "FPR=0/24 across three independent seeds"（或等价的更精炼表述），删除任何残留的 "single-seed" 限定
2. **Conclusion**: 同步升级 FPR 表述为 3-seed
3. **Table 1**: 确保 α=0.0 行有三 seed 数据（mean±std 格式）
4. **Experiments section**: 加入 dose-response 单调性叙述——0% (α=0.0) → 0% (α=0.25) → 79% (α=0.75) → ~100% (α=1.0)，这是 systematic dose-response with multi-seed replication
5. **Limitations**: 删除任何 "FPR based on single seed" 的 limitation（已不适用）

完成后跑 check_paper_consistency。

Let me read the relevant files to make these changes. I need to check:
1. Abstract - FPR wording
2. Conclusion - FPR wording
3. Table 1 (experiments.tex) - α=0.0 row
4. Experiments section - dose-response narrative
5. Limitations - single-seed FPR limitation

Let me read them.
