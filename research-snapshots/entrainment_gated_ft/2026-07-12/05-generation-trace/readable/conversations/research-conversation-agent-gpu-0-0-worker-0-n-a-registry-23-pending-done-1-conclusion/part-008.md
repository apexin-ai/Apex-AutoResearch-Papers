3	\section{Confirmatory and Exploratory Analyses}\label{app:benchmark_details}
4	
5	The task taxonomy used in \S\ref{ssec:task_taxonomy} was defined prior to running any convergence analyses. Each benchmark was assigned to exactly one of four categories based on the primary cognitive demand of the task:
6	
7	\begin{itemize}
8	    \item \textbf{Retrieval}: tasks requiring prediction from long-range context without multi-step reasoning (LAMBADA).
9	    \item \textbf{Comprehension}: reading comprehension with explicit passage support (BoolQ).
10	    \item \textbf{Reasoning}: tasks requiring commonsense inference or multi-step reasoning (HellaSwag, ARC-Challenge, WinoGrande, PIQA).
11	    \item \textbf{Mixed}: tasks combining retrieval, comprehension, and reasoning demands (ARC-Easy, MMLU, SciQ, XStoryCloze).
12	\end{itemize}
13	
14	\paragraph{Confirmatory benchmark set.} Six benchmarks were designated as confirmatory for Bonferroni correction: LAMBADA, HellaSwag, ARC-Challenge, WinoGrande, ARC-Easy, and MMLU. These were selected as representative of retrieval, reasoning, and mixed categories before any convergence analysis was performed. The taxonomy and benchmark selection were fixed before analysis as an informal pre-analysis plan; we describe this as a confirmatory/exploratory split rather than a formal pre-registration, since no external timestamp exists. The main text applies the more conservative all-10-benchmark correction (Bonferroni-adjusted $p = .017 \times 10 = .170$). \textbf{Sensitivity:} correcting across only the six confirmatory benchmarks yields adjusted $p = .017 \times 6 = .100$, still above conventional significance.
15	
16	\paragraph{One-sided test.} If one adopts the prior that attention should reduce cross-architecture variance, the one-sided permutation $p$-value for LAMBADA is $1/120 \approx 0.0083$. Under 10-benchmark Bonferroni correction, this yields an adjusted $p = 0.083$, above the conventional threshold. We report two-sided tests throughout the main text as the more conservative choice; the one-sided result is noted here for completeness.
17	
18	\paragraph{Exploratory benchmarks.} Four additional benchmarks (BoolQ, PIQA, SciQ, XStoryCloze) were added as exploratory tests. All benchmarks share the same 10-benchmark correction (adjusted threshold $\alpha / 10 = 0.005$) and the four exploratory benchmarks are labeled as such throughout the paper. The all-10 Bonferroni correction reported in the main text is the only correction used for inference; the exploratory 6-benchmark subset correction in this appendix is provided for transparency.
19	
20	\paragraph{Supplementary benchmark.} COPA ($n = 100$) is treated as supplementary due to its small sample size. It is excluded from both correction families and reported separately with the $\dagger$ annotation in Table~\ref{tab:convergence}.
21	
22	\section{Convergence Detail}\label{app:convergence_detail}
23	
24	% Figure moved to main text (\S\ref{ssec:decoupling}).
25	
26	Beyond LAMBADA ($\rho = -1.0$), two benchmarks show moderate negative correlations that do not reach significance: ARC-Easy and MMLU (both $\rho = -0.7$, $p = .233$). Both are classified as ``Mixed'' tasks combining retrieval with reasoning demands. The sensitivity analysis (Appendix~\ref{app:sensitivity}) shows that MMLU's correlation reverses upon GDN exclusion ($\rho = +0.6$), indicating dependence on a single architecture; ARC-Easy's correlation is more stable. COPA ($n = 100$; supplementary) shows $\rho = -0.67$ with a large $\sigma$ ratio (5.57), consistent with LAMBADA's pattern but unreliable due to small sample size.
27	
28	Several benchmarks show positive or near-zero $\rho$ (BoolQ: $+0.2$; ARC-C: $+0.6$; HellaSwag: $+0.3$; WinoGrande: $+0.1$; SciQ: $+0.1$), indicating that attention does not systematically reduce cross-architecture variance on reasoning or comprehension tasks. The contrast with LAMBADA is consistent with attention's convergence benefit being specific to tasks requiring direct token-level recall \citep{arora2024zoology,arora2024based} rather than multi-step inference.
29	
30	\paragraph{Regression to the mean.} The direction of LAMBADA's aggregate convergence is consistent with regression to the mean: GDN (highest pure accuracy, 0.543) declines to 0.513 under h3-1, while HGRN2 (lowest, 0.484) rises to 0.514, yielding a $5\times$ $\sigma$ compression ($0.024 \to 0.005$). However, three observations argue against a purely statistical artifact. First, the $5\times$ reduction in cross-architecture $\sigma$ far exceeds typical regression amplitudes. Second, the direction is entirely determined by architecture identity, not random fluctuation: HGRN2 accuracy increases monotonically across all attention ratios, while GDN decreases monotonically---a pattern inconsistent with noise-driven mean reversion. Third, per-example analysis (\S\ref{ssec:per_example}) reveals architecture-specific patterns: GDN's net $-153$ examples and HGRN2's net $+153$ examples reflect distinct helped/hurt profiles with low cross-architecture Jaccard overlap, indicating that the aggregate convergence arises from structured, architecture-dependent per-example changes rather than symmetric regression.
31	
32	\section{Scale-Dependent Convergence}\label{app:scale_convergence}
33	
34	At 1.3B parameters, LAMBADA convergence is monotonic: $\sigma$ decreases at every attention level from 0\% through 25\% ($\rho = -1.0$). At 340M, convergence is partial: $\sigma$ reaches a maximum reduction of 56\% at intermediate attention ratios but rebounds at h3-1, yielding a net endpoint reduction of 36\%. The trajectory is non-monotonic, and the highest-attention model does not achieve the lowest cross-architecture variance. One possible interpretation is that at smaller scale, the capacity overhead of attention layers creates interference that offsets the retrieval benefit.
35	
36	This contrast is a preliminary observation from two data points (not a scaling law). Despite the aggregate divergence at 340M, mean pairwise Jaccard is similar at both scales ($J \approx 0.09$), extending the decoupling observation (\S\ref{ssec:decoupling}) to the scale dimension.
37	
38	\section{Sensitivity Analyses}\label{app:sensitivity}
39	
40	\subsection{Bootstrap Confidence Intervals}
41	
42	We construct 95\% bootstrap confidence intervals for the Spearman $\rho$ between attention ratio and cross-architecture $\sigma$ on LAMBADA using 10{,}000 resamples at the architecture level ($n = 3$ architectures). Of these resamples, 11.25\% are degenerate: they consist of same-architecture triplicates, which produce a constant $\sigma$ vector and therefore an undefined $\rho$ (division by zero in the rank correlation formula). These are excluded from the confidence interval computation because they carry no information about the correlation, not because they represent $\rho = 0$.
43	
44	The BCa (bias-corrected and accelerated) correction degenerates at the $\rho = -1.0$ boundary because the acceleration parameter requires finite jackknife variance, which collapses when the point estimate is at the distributional limit. We therefore report percentile confidence intervals instead. From the 88.75\% informative resamples, the 95\% percentile CI is $[-1.0,\,-0.7]$, which excludes zero.
45	
46	\subsection{GDN Exclusion Sensitivity}
47	
48	The GDN h3-1 configuration uses 16 attention heads rather than 32 (see Appendix~\ref{app:gdn_confound}). To assess the influence of this confound, we recompute all convergence correlations after excluding GDN, leaving two architectures (RetNet, HGRN2) at five attention ratios.
49	
50	Table~\ref{tab:gdn_sensitivity} reports the results for benchmarks where the correlation changes by $|\Delta\rho| \geq 0.3$. LAMBADA weakens from $\rho = -1.0$ to $\rho = -0.7$ ($p = .233$), consistent with GDN contributing to the convergence signal. MMLU reverses from $\rho = -0.7$ to $\rho = +0.6$, confirming that the moderate negative correlation on MMLU depends on GDN's inclusion and should not be interpreted as evidence of convergence.
51	
52	\begin{table}[ht]
53	\centering

55	\caption{Effect of GDN exclusion on Spearman $\rho$ (attention ratio vs.\ cross-architecture $\sigma$) at 1.3B scale. Only benchmarks with $|\Delta\rho| \geq 0.3$ shown.}

57	\begin{tabular}{lrrrr}
58	\toprule
59	Benchmark & $\rho_{\text{all}}$ & $\rho_{\text{no-GDN}}$ & $\Delta\rho$ & $p_{\text{no-GDN}}$ \\
60	\midrule
61	LAMBADA & $-1.0$ & $-0.7$ & $+0.3$ & .233 \\
62	MMLU & $-0.7$ & $+0.6$ & $+1.3$ & .350 \\
63	\bottomrule
64	\end{tabular}
65	\end{table}
66	
67	\section{GDN Attention Head Confound}\label{app:gdn_confound}
68	
69	In the \citet{wang2025hybrid} model zoo, the GDN h3-1 configuration at 1.3B scale uses 16 attention heads per attention layer, while all other hybrid configurations (across GDN, RetNet, and HGRN2) use 32 attention heads. This is a design choice in the original model zoo, not an error. The reduced head count changes the per-head dimension and may affect the attention capacity of GDN h3-1 relative to other configurations.
70	
71	This confound is relevant because the convergence analysis measures cross-architecture $\sigma$ at each attention ratio. At the h3-1 ratio (25\% attention), GDN's attention layers have a different internal structure than those of RetNet and HGRN2, which could contribute to variance reduction (or inflation) for reasons unrelated to the recurrent--attention interaction under study.
72	
73	The sensitivity analysis in Appendix~\ref{app:sensitivity} shows that removing GDN weakens the LAMBADA convergence correlation from $\rho = -1.0$ to $\rho = -0.7$. This weakening is partially attributable to the reduced sample size ($n = 2$ architectures) and partially to the confound itself. We cannot separate these two effects with the available data.
74	
75	\section{Attention Weight Analysis}\label{app:attention_patterns}
76	
77	We extract attention weight matrices from the 1.3B h3-1 models of all three architectures using forward hooks on each attention layer. While \citet{ali2025hidden} show that SSM layers learn implicit attention patterns, our analysis focuses on the explicit attention layers interleaved within the hybrid architecture. For each layer, we compute the mean attention distribution across all 5{,}153 LAMBADA examples and measure cross-architecture similarity via cosine similarity.
78	
79	\subsection{Cross-Architecture Cosine Similarity}
80	
81	Table~\ref{tab:attn_cosine} reports cosine similarity between mean attention distributions at selected layers and averaged across all layers.
82	
83	\begin{table}[ht]
84	\centering
85	\caption{Cosine similarity between mean attention weight distributions of architecture pairs at selected layers (1.3B h3-1 models on LAMBADA).}
86	\label{tab:attn_cosine}
87	\resizebox{\columnwidth}{!}{%
88	\begin{tabular}{lrrr}
89	\toprule
90	Layer & GDN--RetNet & GDN--HGRN2 & HGRN2--RetNet \\
91	\midrule
92	L2 (early) & 0.995 & 0.244 & 0.196 \\
93	L20 (deep) & 0.986 & 0.942 & 0.943 \\
94	\midrule
95	Mean (all layers) & 0.905 & 0.766 & 0.698 \\
96	\bottomrule
97	\end{tabular}%
98	}
99	\end{table}
100	
101	At layer 2, GDN and RetNet produce nearly identical attention distributions (cosine 0.995), while HGRN2 diverges from both (cosine $< 0.25$). By layer 20, all three architectures converge to similar attention patterns (cosine $> 0.94$). The layer-wise trajectory suggests that early-layer attention patterns are shaped by the preceding recurrent layers (which differ across architectures), while deeper layers converge regardless of the recurrent substrate.
102	
103	\subsection{Helped vs.\ Hurt Attention Entropy}
104	
105	To test whether the attention mechanism itself differs between helped and hurt examples, we compute the Shannon entropy of the attention distribution for each example at each attention layer and compare the mean entropy of helped examples against hurt examples within each architecture.
106	
107	\begin{table}[ht]
108	\centering
109	\caption{Mean attention entropy difference (helped $-$ hurt) averaged across attention layers (1.3B h3-1 models on LAMBADA). Values near zero indicate that the attention mechanism does not discriminate between helped and hurt examples.}
110	\label{tab:attn_entropy}
111	\begin{tabular}{lr}
112	\toprule
113	Architecture & $\Delta H$ (helped $-$ hurt) \\
114	\midrule
115	GDN & $-0.0009$ \\
116	RetNet & $+0.0179$ \\
117	HGRN2 & $+0.0020$ \\
118	\bottomrule
119	\end{tabular}
120	\end{table}
121	
122	GDN and HGRN2 show negligible entropy differences ($|\Delta H| \leq 0.002$). RetNet's $\Delta H = +0.018$ is small in absolute terms but slightly larger; helped examples receive marginally more diffuse attention in RetNet. Across all three architectures, the differences are insufficient to explain the per-example divergence, consistent with per-example effects not being explained by attention weight patterns and likely originating in the recurrent layers.
123	
124	\subsection{Last-5 Attention Mass}
125	
126	We also measure the fraction of attention mass allocated to the last five tokens, which captures whether the attention mechanism concentrates differently on recent context for helped vs.\ hurt examples.
127	
128	\begin{table}[ht]
129	\centering
130	\caption{Mean attention mass on last-5 tokens for helped and hurt examples, averaged across attention layers (1.3B h3-1 models on LAMBADA).}
131	\label{tab:attn_last5}
132	\begin{tabular}{lrr}
133	\toprule
134	Architecture & Helped & Hurt \\
135	\midrule
136	GDN & 0.0834 & 0.0831 \\
137	RetNet & 0.1578 & 0.1591 \\
138	HGRN2 & 0.0453 & 0.0467 \\
139	\bottomrule
140	\end{tabular}
141	\end{table}
142	
143	No architecture shows a meaningful difference in last-5 attention mass between helped and hurt examples (Table~\ref{tab:attn_last5}). This further supports the conclusion that the per-example divergence is not driven by differential attention allocation.
144	
145	\section{Cross-Scale Per-Example Comparisons}\label{app:cross_scale}
146	
147	\subsection{Within-Scale Pairwise Jaccard}
148	
149	Table~\ref{tab:within_scale_jaccard} reports the within-scale pairwise Jaccard similarity between architectures' helped and hurt sets at both scales. Mean values are similar across scales (340M: 0.094/0.090; 1.3B: 0.100/0.093), indicating that per-example architecture specificity is consistent across the two scales examined.

156	\begin{tabular}{llcc}

169	\bottomrule
170	\end{tabular}
171	\end{table}
172	
173	\subsection{Cross-Scale Pairwise Jaccard}
174	
175	For each architecture, we compare the helped and hurt sets of the pure $\to$ h3-1 transition at 340M and 1.3B scale on LAMBADA.
176	The comparison uses the same classification scheme as \S\ref{ssec:per_example}: an example is ``helped'' if it is correct only in the hybrid variant and ``hurt'' if correct only in the pure baseline.
177	All pairwise Jaccard values fall below 0.10, indicating that scale variation is associated with per-example predictive multiplicity analogous to the cross-architecture effect reported in \S\ref{ssec:per_example}.

183	\begin{tabular}{llcc}

185	Architecture & Scale Pair & $J_{\text{helped}}$ & $J_{\text{hurt}}$ \\

187	GDN & 340M $\leftrightarrow$ 1.3B & 0.047 & 0.087 \\

196	\section{Per-Example Effect Counts}\label{app:per_example_counts}

198	Table~\ref{tab:per_example} reports the full per-example effect counts for each architecture at 1.3B scale.

214	
215	\section{Normalized Jaccard Effect Size}\label{app:normalized_es}
216	
217	To assess whether low observed Jaccard reflects a floor effect imposed by unequal set sizes, we compute the theoretical upper bound $J_{\max} = \min(|A|,|B|) / \max(|A|,|B|)$ and the normalized effect size $(J_{\text{obs}} - J_{\text{null}}) / (J_{\max} - J_{\text{null}})$, which measures observed overlap as a fraction of the achievable range above chance. Table~\ref{tab:normalized_es} reports per-pair results.

238	\bottomrule
239	\end{tabular}%
240	}
241	\end{table}
242	
243	All normalized effect sizes fall below 0.10, confirming that observed overlap reaches only 6--7\% of the theoretical maximum. The low Jaccard values cannot be attributed to set-size constraints.
244	
245	\section{ARC-Easy Per-Example Analysis}\label{app:arceasy}
246	
247	Table~\ref{tab:arceasy_effects} reports per-example effect counts on ARC-Easy ($N = 2{,}376$) at 1.3B scale for each attention ratio. Unlike LAMBADA, ARC-Easy shows no aggregate convergence ($\rho = -0.20$, $p = .783$). HGRN2 is net positive at all ratios; GDN and RetNet are mixed.

300	To assess whether the observed pairwise Jaccard similarities exceed what would be expected under independence, we perform a permutation test. For each architecture pair at 1.3B h3-1, we hold the helped (or hurt) set sizes fixed and randomly assign example indices to each set (10{,}000 permutations, seed 42). Table~\ref{tab:jaccard_perm} reports the observed $J$, the null baseline $J_{\text{null}}$ (mean over permutations), and the $z$-score.

322	
323	All six comparisons yield $z > 5.9$ ($p < .0001$). The null baseline averages $J_{\text{null}} \approx 0.049$; observed values are approximately twice this level. The overlap between architectures' per-example effect sets is therefore structured rather than a product of random set overlap given the set sizes.
324	
325	\section{Transformer Entrainment Comparison}\label{app:transformer_entrainment}
326	
327	To test whether attention layers make hybrid models' per-example behavior converge toward a pure Transformer, we compare the correct-example sets of each architecture's pure and h3-1 variants against a 1.3B Transformer baseline (accuracy 48.1\%) on LAMBADA. Table~\ref{tab:transformer_jaccard} reports the Jaccard similarity between each model's correct set and the Transformer's correct set.
328	
329	\begin{table}[ht]
330	\centering
331	\caption{Jaccard similarity between each model's correct set and the Transformer correct set on LAMBADA (1.3B scale). All three h3-1 hybrids are more similar to the Transformer than their pure counterparts.}

338	GDN & 0.645 & 0.649 & $+$0.005 \\
339	RetNet & 0.679 & 0.694 & $+$0.015 \\

341	\bottomrule
342	\end{tabular}
343	\end{table}
344	
345	All three architectures show positive $\Delta$: the h3-1 correct set is more similar to the Transformer correct set than the pure correct set is. The effect is strongest for HGRN2 ($+$0.029) and weakest for GDN ($+$0.005). This ordering is consistent with HGRN2 being the only architecture with a positive net per-example effect from attention (Table~\ref{tab:per_example}). The Transformer itself achieves the lowest accuracy among all models, so the convergence is not explained by hybrid models degrading toward Transformer-level performance; rather, adding attention shifts which specific examples the hybrid gets correct toward the Transformer's pattern.
346	
347	\section{Within-Architecture Per-Example Stability}\label{app:within_arch_stability}
348	
349	Per-example effect sets exhibit a three-tier Jaccard hierarchy on LAMBADA (1.3B scale). Under independence (permutation baseline), pairwise Jaccard is $J \approx 0.05$. Cross-architecture comparisons (different architectures at the same attention ratio) yield $J \approx 0.10$, approximately $2\times$ baseline. Within-architecture comparisons (same architecture across different attention ratios) yield $J \approx 0.33$, approximately $7\times$ baseline and $3\times$ the cross-architecture level. Architecture identity therefore has approximately three times the influence of attention ratio on per-example effects.
350	
351	Table~\ref{tab:within_arch_summary} reports mean within-architecture Jaccard for each architecture. HGRN2 shows the highest helped overlap and lowest hurt overlap, consistent with its monotonically increasing helped count across ratios (479 $\to$ 548).

397	Adjacent ratio pairs (e.g., h24-1 vs.\ h12-1) do not exhibit systematically higher Jaccard than non-adjacent pairs (e.g., h24-1 vs.\ h3-1). Across all architectures, the mean Jaccard for adjacent pairs is 0.353 (helped) and 0.311 (hurt), compared with 0.343 (helped) and 0.310 (hurt) for non-adjacent pairs. The negligible difference indicates that the mapping from attention ratio to per-example effects is non-smooth: doubling the attention ratio does not produce a proportionally more similar set of affected examples.
398	
399	\section{Cross-Benchmark Jaccard Trajectories}\label{app:cross_bench_jaccard}
400	
401	To test whether Jaccard saturation is specific to LAMBADA or a general property, we compute mean pairwise Jaccard trajectories across all four hybrid attention ratios on all four main benchmarks. Table~\ref{tab:cross_bench_jaccard} reports the results. On every benchmark, Jaccard shows no statistically significant trend with attention ratio (all $\rho \leq 0.80$, $p \geq 0.333$), with values uniformly between 0.08 and 0.11. The saturation at the first attention level observed on LAMBADA (\S\ref{ssec:decoupling}) thus generalizes: once any attention is present, each architecture's per-example response is largely fixed regardless of attention ratio.

420	
421	\section{Continuous-Threshold Jaccard Analysis}\label{app:continuous_jaccard}
422	
423	The main text binarizes per-example effects at the correctness boundary. To verify that low cross-architecture Jaccard is not an artifact of this binarization, we compute Jaccard similarity using a continuous confidence threshold $\tau$: two architectures' effect sets are defined as the examples whose target-token $|\log p|$ changes by more than $\tau$ when attention is added. On LAMBADA, mean pairwise Jaccard decreases monotonically from 0.26 ($\tau = 0.00$, any change) to 0.05 ($\tau = 0.30$, large changes only). ARC-Easy and PIQA show the same monotonic decrease. The binary threshold ($\tau = 0$, correctness flip) thus represents the upper end of cross-architecture overlap; restricting to confident transitions further reduces agreement, confirming that low Jaccard is robust to the choice of binarization threshold.
424	
425	\section{Target-Token Confidence Margin}
426	\label{app:confidence_margin}
427	
428	We analyze whether pure-model confidence on the target token predicts whether attention will help or hurt on a given example.
429	We define confidence as $|\log p_{\text{pure}}(y^*)|$, where $y^*$ is the target token: lower values indicate higher probability (near-correct).
430	We initially tested raw perplexity as a predictor of helped/hurt status, but found that within-category controls (C1/C2) are necessary to isolate attention effects from the definitional confound between pure-correct and pure-wrong populations.
431	
432	Table~\ref{tab:cm_c1} compares hurt versus stayed-right samples (both pure-correct): hurt samples have significantly lower target-token probability (higher $|\log p|$), confirming that weakly-correct predictions are vulnerable to attention disruption.
433	Table~\ref{tab:cm_c2} compares helped versus stayed-wrong samples (both pure-wrong): helped samples have higher target-token probability (lower $|\log p|$), confirming that near-miss errors are rescuable.
434	This pattern is consistent across all three architectures ($|d| = 0.73$--$0.92$, all $p < 10^{-54}$) but does not alter the cross-architecture Jaccard findings---within-architecture predictability coexists with cross-architecture divergence.

470	\subsection{Cross-Benchmark Extension}\label{app:cm_cross}
471	
472	The confidence margin pattern extends beyond LAMBADA to multiple-choice benchmarks, though with smaller effect sizes. Table~\ref{tab:cm_cross_c2} reports the rescue analysis (helped vs.\ stayed-wrong) on HellaSwag and ARC-Easy. All nine comparisons (three benchmarks $\times$ three architectures) are significant, confirming that attention consistently rescues near-miss errors regardless of task type. Effect sizes range from small on HellaSwag ($d = 0.13$--$0.17$) to medium on ARC-Easy ($d = 0.51$--$0.60$), compared to large on LAMBADA ($d = 0.73$--$0.77$); the attenuation on HellaSwag reflects noisier confidence proxies under length-normalized scoring. Table~\ref{tab:cm_cross_c1} reports the disruption analysis (hurt vs.\ stayed-right); two of six comparisons are significant (all on ARC-Easy) with small effect sizes ($d = 0.13$--$0.26$), indicating that the disruption signal is weaker on multiple-choice tasks and absent on HellaSwag under \texttt{acc\_norm}. The asymmetry between rescue and disruption reflects task structure: near-miss errors are an intrinsic sample property (the model almost produced the correct answer regardless of format), while borderline correctness in multiple-choice settings depends on relative option ranking rather than absolute confidence, reducing the raw log-likelihood margin's predictive power for vulnerability.

516	\subsection{Prediction Framework}\label{app:prediction_framework}
517	
518	We formalize the confidence margin analysis as a binary prediction task: given a pure-model example and its target-token $|\log p|$, predict whether attention will change the example's correctness. Using the within-category summary statistics (Tables~\ref{tab:cm_c1},~\ref{tab:cm_c2}), we derive analytic AUC from Cohen's $d$ via $\text{AUC} = \Phi(|d|/\sqrt{2})$ and compute Gaussian-intersection thresholds (the $|\log p|$ value at which the two group densities intersect under equal priors).
519	
520	Table~\ref{tab:prediction_auc} reports within-architecture prediction performance. All AUCs exceed 0.69, confirming that pure-model confidence is a reliable within-architecture predictor of attention effects. Disruption prediction is consistently stronger than rescue (mean AUC 0.73 vs.\ 0.70), reflecting the larger effect sizes in Control~1.

542	
543	\paragraph{Normality verification.} Shapiro-Wilk tests reject normality for all six architecture--set combinations (all $W < 0.98$, $p < 10^{-6}$), but the practical departure varies by group. Disruption-set $|\log p|$ values show mild skewness (0.53--0.77, $W \in [0.955, 0.973]$), closely approximating a normal distribution at the sample sizes involved. Rescue-set values are moderately right-skewed (skewness 1.33--1.41, $W \in [0.899, 0.920]$), following an approximately log-normal distribution. Because the skew is one-sided, parametric AUC estimates (0.70--0.74 in the main text) are conservative lower bounds; non-parametric empirical AUC from the same data yields 0.73--0.77.
544	
545	Despite similar within-architecture AUC, the optimal prediction thresholds differ across architectures for disruption but not rescue (Table~\ref{tab:threshold_gap}). Rescue thresholds cluster tightly (range 0.03 in $|\log p|$), indicating that the rescuability boundary---the confidence level below which pure-wrong examples are likely to be corrected by attention---is architecture-invariant. Disruption thresholds span a 47\% relative range (GDN: 0.70, RetNet: 1.00, HGRN2: 1.14), meaning that the same confidence level on a pure-correct example may predict vulnerability in one architecture but safety in another. This asymmetry constitutes a second dimension of multiplicity beyond per-example disagreement: all three architectures agree on which wrong answers are rescuable, but disagree on which correct answers are vulnerable to disruption.

563	\section{Calibration Analysis}\label{app:calibration}
564	
565	Cross-architecture disruption threshold variation (\S\ref{ssec:per_example}) could in principle arise from calibration differences rather than genuine differences in per-example processing. We compute expected calibration error (ECE; \citealt{guo2017calibration}) for each architecture's h3-1 model on LAMBADA using 15 equal-width bins. ECE values are similar: GDN 0.222, RetNet 0.224, HGRN2 0.235. The cross-architecture ECE spread (6\%, computed as range/mean) is less than half the disruption threshold spread (47\%; Table~\ref{tab:threshold_gap}), indicating that calibration differences are insufficient to account for the observed threshold divergence. Rescue thresholds, which show only 1\% cross-architecture spread, are consistent with near-identical calibration in the low-confidence regime.
566	
567	\section{BoolQ Supplementary Analysis}
568	\label{app:boolq}
569	
570	BoolQ ($N = 3{,}270$; comprehension, binary yes/no classification) shows the highest ambiguity among the benchmarks we analyzed ($\alpha \approx 0.45$), but the Jaccard significance pattern is mixed: only 12 of 24 architecture $\times$ attention-ratio pair combinations yield $p < .01$. In particular, the RetNet--HGRN2 pair produces 0/8 significant Jaccard values, with several normalized effect sizes below zero, suggesting anti-correlated per-example effects for this pair.
571	
572	\paragraph{Binary classification baseline.} BoolQ is binary classification (two answer choices), whereas LAMBADA, HellaSwag, and ARC-Easy involve open vocabulary prediction or four-way multiple choice. Under a binary task, the null Jaccard baseline $J_{\text{null}}$ is higher because chance overlap between helped/hurt sets is larger when there are fewer ways to be wrong. This elevates the significance threshold: observed Jaccard must be substantially higher to exceed the null, which explains why 12/24 pairs fail to reach significance despite $\bar{J}_h = 0.103$ and $\bar{J}_u = 0.098$---values comparable to the four main benchmarks.
573	
574	\paragraph{Per-example summary.} Table~\ref{tab:boolq_multiplicity} reports the key metrics. The high $\alpha$ reflects that BoolQ examples are more sensitive to architectural variation in the presence of attention: approximately half of all examples change correctness status for at least one architecture. However, the mixed Jaccard significance prevents us from confidently concluding that the cross-architecture overlap structure matches the pattern observed on the four main benchmarks.

591	
592	The significant Jaccard overlap concentrates in GDN--RetNet pairs (8/8 significant), while RetNet--HGRN2 shows none (0/8). This pair-specificity does not appear on the four main benchmarks, where all architecture pairs show significant overlap; it may reflect a BoolQ-specific interaction between binary classification structure and particular recurrent architectures rather than a general property of architecture pairs.
593	
594	\paragraph{Confidence margin.} Confidence margin analysis on BoolQ shows the rescue pattern (C2) partially holds (2/3 architectures significant, $d = 0.16$--$0.36$) but the disruption pattern (C1) is absent (0/3, $|d| \leq 0.10$), consistent with compressed log-likelihood ranges in binary classification reducing the predictive power of confidence margins. This extends the gradient observed across LAMBADA, ARC-Easy, and HellaSwag: C1 effect sizes decrease from open-ended prediction ($d \approx 0.9$, LAMBADA) through ARC-Easy ($d \approx 0.1$--$0.3$) to HellaSwag ($d \approx 0$ under \texttt{acc\_norm}) and binary classification ($d \approx 0$, BoolQ). The gradient broadly tracks the coefficient of variation (CV) of the log-likelihood confidence proxy: LAMBADA ($\text{CV} = 0.75$) $>$ ARC-Easy ($0.54$) $>$ HellaSwag ($0.49$) $>$ BoolQ ($0.22$). BoolQ's high-frequency short completions (``\,yes''/``\,no'') yield elevated baseline log-likelihoods (mean $|\text{loglik}| = 3.04$ vs.\ $0.84$ for LAMBADA) with similar absolute spread (IQR $\approx 0.9$), compressing the relative variation and rendering the confidence margin unable to separate borderline-correct from robustly-correct examples.
595	
596	\paragraph{Interpretation.} The RetNet--HGRN2 anti-correlation may reflect different error modes specific to binary classification: when one architecture's recurrent state resolves a yes/no ambiguity through attention, the other architecture's resolution may be disrupted by the same attention intervention. This pattern warrants further investigation with additional binary classification benchmarks to determine whether it is BoolQ-specific or characteristic of two-choice tasks more broadly.

598	\section{WinoGrande Supplementary Analysis}
599	\label{app:winogrande}
600	
601	WinoGrande ($N = 1{,}267$; reasoning, two-choice coreference resolution) shows high ambiguity ($\alpha \approx 0.41$ at h3-1) but mixed Jaccard significance: 10 of 24 architecture $\times$ attention-ratio pair combinations yield $p < .01$. Mean pairwise Jaccard ($\bar{J}_h = 0.110$, $\bar{J}_u = 0.103$) is comparable to the four main benchmarks, but the elevated null baseline from near-chance accuracy (${\sim}60\%$) reduces statistical power to detect above-chance overlap.
602	
603	\paragraph{Near-chance accuracy.} WinoGrande accuracy across hybrid configurations ranges from 59\% to 62\%, close to the two-choice chance level of 50\%. At near-chance accuracy, a large fraction of examples are borderline---small perturbations (such as adding attention) can flip predictions in either direction, inflating the helped and hurt sets and consequently $\alpha$. This structural property, shared with BoolQ (${\sim}59\%$ accuracy, $\alpha \approx 0.45$), may partially explain the elevated $\alpha$ rather than task-intrinsic multiplicity. PIQA (73\% accuracy, $\alpha = 0.14$) and HellaSwag (60\% normalized accuracy, $\alpha = 0.15$) demonstrate that near-chance accuracy is not the sole driver, but we cannot fully exclude it as a contributing factor for WinoGrande and BoolQ.

622	\section{340M Per-Example Analysis}\label{app:scale_per_example}
623	
624	\subsection{LAMBADA}
625	
626	At 340M, LAMBADA per-example multiplicity closely matches the 1.3B pattern: $\alpha = 0.313$ (vs.\ 0.307 at 1.3B), with mean pairwise Jaccard $\bar{J} \approx 0.089$ (vs.\ 0.095). Per-example directionality is preserved: HGRN2 shows net positive effects at h3-1 ($+238$ examples), while GDN ($-256$) and RetNet ($-106$) show net negative effects, mirroring the 1.3B profile (HGRN2 $+153$, GDN $-153$, RetNet $-69$).
627	
628	However, aggregate convergence is absent at 340M: $\rho = -0.50$ ($p = .45$), with non-monotonic $\sigma$ across attention ratios ($0.025 \to 0.012 \to 0.018 \to 0.011 \to 0.016$). This contrasts sharply with 1.3B ($\rho = -1.0$, $p = .017$, monotonic $\sigma$ decrease). The decoupling between per-example divergence and aggregate convergence thus manifests differently across scales: at 340M, per-example multiplicity is present but aggregate convergence is not, suggesting that convergence requires sufficient model capacity while multiplicity does not.
629	
630	Within-benchmark $\alpha$ variation across attention ratios is also larger at 340M (0.047, from 0.313 at pure to 0.266 at h3-1) than at 1.3B ($< 0.03$; \S\ref{ssec:per_example}), suggesting that smaller models are more sensitive to the attention ratio in terms of per-example disagreement patterns.

651	\subsection{Cross-Benchmark Scale Comparison}
652	
653	Table~\ref{tab:340m_multi_bench} extends the scale comparison to all four main benchmarks. Two patterns emerge. First, $\alpha$ is systematically higher at 340M across all benchmarks, with the largest gap on ARC-Easy ($+$8.4pp) and the smallest on LAMBADA ($+$0.6pp). Second, pairwise Jaccard remains stable across scales ($\bar{J}_h = 0.08$--$0.10$ at both scales); three-architecture results are stable across both 340M and 1.3B scales (Jaccard $\approx$ 0.08--0.10), providing indirect support for consistency across these two scales. This suggests that the qualitative pattern of per-example multiplicity---which architectures affect which examples---is consistent across the two scales examined, even as its magnitude increases at smaller scale. Notably, the $\alpha$ inflation does not track accuracy loss: HellaSwag has the largest accuracy gap between scales yet the smallest $\Delta\alpha$ ($+$1.9pp), while ARC-Easy has a smaller accuracy gap but the largest $\Delta\alpha$ ($+$8.4pp), arguing against accuracy as the primary driver of scale-dependent multiplicity.

677	Convergence is absent at 340M across all benchmarks (all $|\rho| \leq 0.4$, $p \geq .45$), in contrast to 1.3B where LAMBADA shows monotonic convergence. The absence of convergence at 340M extends beyond LAMBADA to HellaSwag ($\rho = 0.4$, $p = .52$), PIQA ($\rho = 0.3$, $p = .68$), and ARC-Easy ($\rho = -0.1$, $p = .95$).

703	\section{Complementarity Decomposition}\label{app:complementarity}
704	
705	We decompose the three-architecture vote on each example into four categories: unanimous correct (3/3), majority correct (2/3), minority correct (1/3), and unanimous wrong (0/3). This decomposition explains the structural failure of majority vote despite substantial per-example complementarity.
706	
707	Table~\ref{tab:complementarity} reports the decomposition at h3-1 (25\% attention). Majority vote benefits only from 2/3 examples (where the correct answer holds a majority) but is actively harmed by 1/3 examples (where the correct architecture is outvoted). On LAMBADA, HellaSwag, and ARC-Easy, the MV exploitation ratio---the fraction of complementary examples where MV selects correctly---hovers near 51\%, indicating a near-even split between MV-exploitable and MV-hostile disagreements. The oracle, by contrast, exploits both categories, explaining the large oracle--MV gap ($+7$--$14$\,pp).

725	
726	This near-50\% exploitation ratio is structurally invariant across attention ratios: on LAMBADA, the ratio ranges from 51.1\% to 54.4\% across all five configurations; on HellaSwag, from 50.3\% to 51.6\%. Attention changes neither the amount nor the structure of cross-architecture complementarity.
727	
728	\section{Seed-Variation Calibration}\label{app:seed_calibration}
729	
730	To contextualize the $3\times$ within- vs.\ cross-architecture Jaccard gap (\S\ref{ssec:decoupling}), we compare against within-seed variation using the Pythia 70M \citep{biderman2023pythia} PolyPythias models \citep{vanderwal2025polypythias}, which provide 9 individually trained seeds of the same architecture.
731	
732	On LAMBADA ($N = 5{,}153$), within-seed mean Jaccard is $\bar{J}_h = 0.273$ (helped) and $\bar{J}_u = 0.393$ (hurt), compared to our cross-architecture reference $J \approx 0.10$. On ARC-Easy ($N = 2{,}376$), within-seed $\bar{J}_h = 0.312$ and $\bar{J}_u = 0.354$, versus cross-architecture $J \approx 0.092$. Within-seed ambiguity is $\alpha = 0.36$ (LAMBADA) and $\alpha = 0.49$ (ARC-Easy), compared to cross-architecture $\alpha = 0.30$ and $0.21$ respectively.
733	
734	Seeds thus produce comparable or higher amounts of per-example disagreement ($\alpha$) but on more overlapping examples (higher $J$). Cross-architecture variation is associated with per-example effects on less overlapping examples (lower $J$), consistent with architecture-driven divergence yielding qualitatively different per-example patterns than seed noise. The within-seed Jaccard is 2.7--4.3$\times$ higher than cross-architecture Jaccard across both benchmarks.
735	
736	Three caveats qualify this comparison. First, scale mismatch: Pythia 70M is $5\times$ smaller than our smallest models (340M); attempts to use Pythia 410M failed repeatedly. Second, architecture family: Pythia is a standard Transformer, not a hybrid recurrent architecture, so this is a cross-family reference point rather than a matched control. Third, accuracy regime: Pythia 70M accuracy (LAMBADA 0.17--0.23, ARC-Easy ${\sim}$0.38) is far below our models (${\sim}$0.50, ${\sim}$0.72), and Jaccard is affected by base rates; the 2.7--4.3$\times$ ratio may differ at accuracy regimes closer to our main experiments. These limitations restrict the comparison to a reference point for seed-variation magnitude rather than definitive evidence for architecture-driven effects.
737	
738	\section{Extended Architecture Validation (Five Architectures)}\label{app:extended_arch}
739	
740	To test whether the low cross-architecture Jaccard pattern generalizes beyond the three primary architectures, we extend the analysis to include two additional architectures from the same model zoo: GLA (Gated Linear Attention) and DeltaNet, yielding ten pairwise comparisons. Both are available only at 340M in the model zoo; all results below use the h3-1 (25\% attention) configuration. This extension validates per-example divergence (not aggregate convergence).

779	All pairwise Jaccard values remain $\leq 0.14$, consistent with the three-architecture results at 1.3B (Table~\ref{tab:per_example}). The seven new pairs involving GLA and DeltaNet show no systematic difference from the original three pairs (Mann-Whitney $p > .3$ for both helped and hurt), indicating that the low-overlap pattern is not specific to the original architecture triple. A sixth architecture (HGRN; \citealp{qin2023hierarchically}) is also available in the zoo but excluded from the main analysis: its substantially lower baseline accuracy on LAMBADA (0.263 vs.\ 0.32--0.38 for the other five) mechanically inflates helped-set sizes and Jaccard values. All 15 six-architecture permutation tests nonetheless remain significant ($z \geq 2.9$, $p \leq .006$). The same pattern holds on HellaSwag ($N = 10{,}042$) and PIQA ($N = 1{,}838$): all 20 additional pairwise tests yield $p < .01$ with mean $J_{\text{helped}} \leq 0.10$. Full four-benchmark and six-architecture data are included in our code release.

Each benchmark was assigned to exactly one of four categories based on the primary cognitive demand of the task:\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item \\textbf{Retrieval}: tasks requiring prediction from long-range context without multi-step reasoning (LAMBADA).\n    \\item \\textbf{Comprehension}: reading comprehension with explicit passage support (BoolQ).\n    \\item \\textbf{Reasoning}: tasks requiring commonsense inference or multi-step reasoning (HellaSwag, ARC-Challenge, WinoGrande, PIQA).\n    \\item \\textbf{Mixed}: tasks combining retrieval, comprehension, and reasoning demands (ARC-Easy, MMLU, SciQ, XStoryCloze).\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\paragraph{Confirmatory benchmark set.} Six benchmarks were designated as confirmatory for Bonferroni correction: LAMBADA, HellaSwag, ARC-Challenge, WinoGrande, ARC-Easy, and MMLU. These were selected as representative of retrieval, reasoning, and mixed categories before any convergence analysis was performed. The taxonomy and benchmark selection were fixed before analysis as an informal pre-analysis plan; we describe this as a confirmatory/exploratory split rather than a formal pre-registration, since no external timestamp exists. The main text applies the more conservative all-10-benchmark correction (Bonferroni-adjusted $p = .017 \\times 10 = .170$). \\textbf{Sensitivity:} correcting across only the six confirmatory benchmarks yields adjusted $p = .017 \\times 6 = .100$, still above conventional significance.\n\n\\paragraph{One-sided test.} If one adopts the prior that attention should reduce cross-architecture variance, the one-sided permutation $p$-value for LAMBADA is $1/120 \\approx 0.0083$. Under 10-benchmark Bonferroni correction, this yields an adjusted $p = 0.083$, above the conventional threshold. We report two-sided tests throughout the main text as the more conservative choice; the one-sided result is noted here for completeness.\n\n\\paragraph{Exploratory benchmarks.} Four additional benchmarks (BoolQ, PIQA, SciQ, XStoryCloze) were added as exploratory tests. All benchmarks share the same 10-benchmark correction (adjusted threshold $\\alpha / 10 = 0.005$) and the four exploratory benchmarks are labeled as such throughout the paper. The all-10 Bonferroni correction reported in the main text is the only correction used for inference; the exploratory 6-benchmark subset correction in this appendix is provided for transparency.\n\n\\paragraph{Supplementary benchmark.} COPA ($n = 100$) is treated as supplementary due to its small sample size. It is excluded from both correction families and reported separately with the $\\dagger$ annotation in Table~\\ref{tab:convergence}.\n\n\\section{Convergence Detail}\\label{app:convergence_detail}\n\n% Figure moved to main text (\\S\\ref{ssec:decoupling}).\n\nBeyond LAMBADA ($\\rho = -1.0$), two benchmarks show moderate negative correlations that do not reach significance: ARC-Easy and MMLU (both $\\rho = -0.7$, $p = .233$). Both are classified as ``Mixed'' tasks combining retrieval with reasoning demands. The sensitivity analysis (Appendix~\\ref{app:sensitivity}) shows that MMLU's correlation reverses upon GDN exclusion ($\\rho = +0.6$), indicating dependence on a single architecture; ARC-Easy's correlation is more stable. COPA ($n = 100$; supplementary) shows $\\rho = -0.67$ with a large $\\sigma$ ratio (5.57), consistent with LAMBADA's pattern but unreliable due to small sample size.\n\nSeveral benchmarks show positive or near-zero $\\rho$ (BoolQ: $+0.2$; ARC-C: $+0.6$; HellaSwag: $+0.3$; WinoGrande: $+0.1$; SciQ: $+0.1$), indicating that attention does not systematically reduce cross-architecture variance on reasoning or comprehension tasks. The contrast with LAMBADA is consistent with attention's convergence benefit being specific to tasks requiring direct token-level recall \\citep{arora2024zoology,arora2024based} rather than multi-step inference.\n\n\\paragraph{Regression to the mean.} The direction of LAMBADA's aggregate convergence is consistent with regression to the mean: GDN (highest pure accuracy, 0.543) declines to 0.513 under h3-1, while HGRN2 (lowest, 0.484) rises to 0.514, yielding a $5\\times$ $\\sigma$ compression ($0.024 \\to 0.005$). However, three observations argue against a purely statistical artifact. First, the $5\\times$ reduction in cross-architecture $\\sigma$ far exceeds typical regression amplitudes. Second, the direction is entirely determined by architecture identity, not random fluctuation: HGRN2 accuracy increases monotonically across all attention ratios, while GDN decreases monotonically---a pattern inconsistent with noise-driven mean reversion. Third, per-example analysis (\\S\\ref{ssec:per_example}) reveals architecture-specific patterns: GDN's net $-153$ examples and HGRN2's net $+153$ examples reflect distinct helped/hurt profiles with low cross-architecture Jaccard overlap, indicating that the aggregate convergence arises from structured, architecture-dependent per-example changes rather than symmetric regression.\n\n\\section{Scale-Dependent Convergence}\\label{app:scale_convergence}\n\nAt 1.3B parameters, LAMBADA convergence is monotonic: $\\sigma$ decreases at every attention level from 0\\% through 25\\% ($\\rho = -1.0$). At 340M, convergence is partial: $\\sigma$ reaches a maximum reduction of 56\\% at intermediate attention ratios but rebounds at h3-1, yielding a net endpoint reduction of 36\\%. The trajectory is non-monotonic, and the highest-attention model does not achieve the lowest cross-architecture variance. One possible interpretation is that at smaller scale, the capacity overhead of attention layers creates interference that offsets the retrieval benefit.\n\nThis contrast is a preliminary observation from two data points (not a scaling law). Despite the aggregate divergence at 340M, mean pairwise Jaccard is similar at both scales ($J \\approx 0.09$), extending the decoupling observation (\\S\\ref{ssec:decoupling}) to the scale dimension.\n\n\\section{Sensitivity Analyses}\\label{app:sensitivity}\n\n\\subsection{Bootstrap Confidence Intervals}\n\nWe construct 95\\% bootstrap confidence intervals for the Spearman $\\rho$ between attention ratio and cross-architecture $\\sigma$ on LAMBADA using 10{,}000 resamples at the architecture level ($n = 3$ architectures). Of these resamples, 11.25\\% are degenerate: they consist of same-architecture triplicates, which produce a constant $\\sigma$ vector and therefore an undefined $\\rho$ (division by zero in the rank correlation formula). These are excluded from the confidence interval computation because they carry no information about the correlation, not because they represent $\\rho = 0$.\n\nThe BCa (bias-corrected and accelerated) correction degenerates at the $\\rho = -1.0$ boundary because the acceleration parameter requires finite jackknife variance, which collapses when the point estimate is at the distributional limit. We therefore report percentile confidence intervals instead. From the 88.75\\% informative resamples, the 95\\% percentile CI is $[-1.0,\\,-0.7]$, which excludes zero.\n\n\\subsection{GDN Exclusion Sensitivity}\n\nThe GDN h3-1 configuration uses 16 attention heads rather than 32 (see Appendix~\\ref{app:gdn_confound}). To assess the influence of this confound, we recompute all convergence correlations after excluding GDN, leaving two architectures (RetNet, HGRN2) at five attention ratios.\n\nTable~\\ref{tab:gdn_sensitivity} reports the results for benchmarks where the correlation changes by $|\\Delta\\rho| \\geq 0.3$. LAMBADA weakens from $\\rho = -1.0$ to $\\rho = -0.7$ ($p = .233$), consistent with GDN contributing to the convergence signal. MMLU reverses from $\\rho = -0.7$ to $\\rho = +0.6$, confirming that the moderate negative correlation on MMLU depends on GDN's inclusion and should not be interpreted as evidence of convergence.\n\n\\begin{table}[ht]\n\\centering\n\\small\n\\caption{Effect of GDN exclusion on Spearman $\\rho$ (attention ratio vs.\\ cross-architecture $\\sigma$) at 1.3B scale. Only benchmarks with $|\\Delta\\rho| \\geq 0.3$ shown.}\n\\label{tab:gdn_sensitivity}\n\\begin{tabular}{lrrrr}\n\\toprule\nBenchmark & $\\rho_{\\text{all}}$ & $\\rho_{\\text{no-GDN}}$ & $\\Delta\\rho$ & $p_{\\text{no-GDN}}$ \\\\\n\\midrule\nLAMBADA & $-1.0$ & $-0.7$ & $+0.3$ & .233 \\\\\nMMLU & $-0.7$ & $+0.6$ & $+1.3$ & .350 \\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\n\n\\section{GDN Attention Head Confound}\\label{app:gdn_confound}\n\nIn the \\citet{wang2025hybrid} model zoo, the GDN h3-1 configuration at 1.3B scale uses 16 attention heads per attention layer, while all other hybrid configurations (across GDN, RetNet, and HGRN2) use 32 attention heads. This is a design choice in the original model zoo, not an error. The reduced head count changes the per-head dimension and may affect the attention capacity of GDN h3-1 relative to other configurations.\n\nThis confound is relevant because the convergence analysis measures cross-architecture $\\sigma$ at each attention ratio. At the h3-1 ratio (25\\% attention), GDN's attention layers have a different internal structure than those of RetNet and HGRN2, which could contribute to variance reduction (or inflation) for reasons unrelated to the recurrent--attention interaction under study.\n\nThe sensitivity analysis in Appendix~\\ref{app:sensitivity} shows that removing GDN weakens the LAMBADA convergence correlation from $\\rho = -1.0$ to $\\rho = -0.7$. This weakening is partially attributable to the reduced sample size ($n = 2$ architectures) and partially to the confound itself. We cannot separate these two effects with the available data.\n\n\\section{Attention Weight Analysis}\\label{app:attention_patterns}\n\nWe extract attention weight matrices from the 1.3B h3-1 models of all three architectures using forward hooks on each attention layer. While \\citet{ali2025hidden} show that SSM layers learn implicit attention patterns, our analysis focuses on the explicit attention layers interleaved within the hybrid architecture. For each layer, we compute the mean attention distribution across all 5{,}153 LAMBADA examples and measure cross-architecture similarity via cosine similarity.\n\n\\subsection{Cross-Architecture Cosine Similarity}\n\nTable~\\ref{tab:attn_cosine} reports cosine similarity between mean attention distributions at selected layers and averaged across all layers.\n\n\\begin{table}[ht]\n\\centering\n\\caption{Cosine similarity between mean attention weight distributions of architecture pairs at selected layers (1.3B h3-1 models on LAMBADA).}\n\\label{tab:attn_cosine}\n\\resizebox{\\columnwidth}{!}{%\n\\begin{tabular}{lrrr}\n\\toprule\nLayer & GDN--RetNet & GDN--HGRN2 & HGRN2--RetNet \\\\\n\\midrule\nL2 (early) & 0.995 & 0.244 & 0.196 \\\\\nL20 (deep) & 0.986 & 0.942 & 0.943 \\\\\n\\midrule\nMean (all layers) & 0.905 & 0.766 & 0.698 \\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}%\n}\n\\end{table}\n\nAt layer 2, GDN and RetNet produce nearly identical attention distributions (cosine 0.995), while HGRN2 diverges from both (cosine $< 0.25$). By layer 20, all three architectures converge to similar attention patterns (cosine $> 0.94$). The layer-wise trajectory suggests that early-layer attention patterns are shaped by the preceding recurrent layers (which differ across architectures), while deeper layers converge regardless of the recurrent substrate.\n\n\\subsection{Helped vs.\\ Hurt Attention Entropy}\n\nTo test whether the attention mechanism itself differs between helped and hurt examples, we compute the Shannon entropy of the attention distribution for each example at each attention layer and compare the mean entropy of helped examples against hurt examples within each architecture.\n\n\\begin{table}[ht]\n\\centering\n\\caption{Mean attention entropy difference (helped $-$ hurt) averaged across attention layers (1.3B h3-1 models on LAMBADA).

RetNet's $\\Delta H = +0.018$ is small in absolute terms but slightly larger; helped examples receive marginally more diffuse attention in RetNet. Across all three architectures, the differences are insufficient to explain the per-example divergence, consistent with per-example effects not being explained by attention weight patterns and likely originating in the recurrent layers.\n\n\\subsection{Last-5 Attention Mass}\n\nWe also measure the fraction of attention mass allocated to the last five tokens, which captures whether the attention mechanism concentrates differently on recent context for helped vs.\\ hurt examples.\n\n\\begin{table}[ht]\n\\centering\n\\caption{Mean attention mass on last-5 tokens for helped and hurt examples, averaged across attention layers (1.3B h3-1 models on LAMBADA).}\n\\label{tab:attn_last5}\n\\begin{tabular}{lrr}\n\\toprule\nArchitecture & Helped & Hurt \\\\\n\\midrule\nGDN & 0.0834 & 0.0831 \\\\\nRetNet & 0.1578 & 0.1591 \\\\\nHGRN2 & 0.0453 & 0.0467 \\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\n\nNo architecture shows a meaningful difference in last-5 attention mass between helped and hurt examples (Table~\\ref{tab:attn_last5}). This further supports the conclusion that the per-example divergence is not driven by differential attention allocation.\n\n\\section{Cross-Scale Per-Example Comparisons}\\label{app:cross_scale}\n\n\\subsection{Within-Scale Pairwise Jaccard}\n\nTable~\\ref{tab:within_scale_jaccard} reports the within-scale pairwise Jaccard similarity between architectures' helped and hurt sets at both scales.

For each architecture pair at 1.3B h3-1, we hold the helped (or hurt) set sizes fixed and randomly assign example indices to each set (10{,}000 permutations, seed 42).

The overlap between architectures' per-example effect sets is therefore structured rather than a product of random set overlap given the set sizes.\n\n\\section{Transformer Entrainment Comparison}\\label{app:transformer_entrainment}\n\nTo test whether attention layers make hybrid models' per-example behavior converge toward a pure Transformer, we compare the correct-example sets of each architecture's pure and h3-1 variants against a 1.3B Transformer baseline (accuracy 48.1\\%) on LAMBADA. Table~\\ref{tab:transformer_jaccard} reports the Jaccard similarity between each model's correct set and the Transformer's correct set.\n\n\\begin{table}[ht]\n\\centering\n\\caption{Jaccard similarity between each model's correct set and the Transformer correct set on LAMBADA (1.3B scale).

The effect is strongest for HGRN2 ($+$0.029) and weakest for GDN ($+$0.005). This ordering is consistent with HGRN2 being the only architecture with a positive net per-example effect from attention (Table~\\ref{tab:per_example}). The Transformer itself achieves the lowest accuracy among all models, so the convergence is not explained by hybrid models degrading toward Transformer-level performance; rather, adding attention shifts which specific examples the hybrid gets correct toward the Transformer's pattern.\n\n\\section{Within-Architecture Per-Example Stability}\\label{app:within_arch_stability}\n\nPer-example effect sets exhibit a three-tier Jaccard hierarchy on LAMBADA (1.3B scale). Under independence (permutation baseline), pairwise Jaccard is $J \\approx 0.05$. Cross-architecture comparisons (different architectures at the same attention ratio) yield $J \\approx 0.10$, approximately $2\\times$ baseline. Within-architecture comparisons (same architecture across different attention ratios) yield $J \\approx 0.33$, approximately $7\\times$ baseline and $3\\times$ the cross-architecture level. Architecture identity therefore has approximately three times the influence of attention ratio on per-example effects.\n\nTable~\\ref{tab:within_arch_summary} reports mean within-architecture Jaccard for each architecture. HGRN2 shows the highest helped overlap and lowest hurt overlap, consistent with its monotonically increasing helped count across ratios (479 $\\to$ 548).\n\n\\begin{table}[ht]\n\\centering\n\\caption{Mean within-architecture pairwise Jaccard similarity across attention ratios (1.3B, LAMBADA).

Across all architectures, the mean Jaccard for adjacent pairs is 0.353 (helped) and 0.311 (hurt), compared with 0.343 (helped) and 0.310 (hurt) for non-adjacent pairs. The negligible difference indicates that the mapping from attention ratio to per-example effects is non-smooth: doubling the attention ratio does not produce a proportionally more similar set of affected examples.\n\n\\section{Cross-Benchmark Jaccard Trajectories}\\label{app:cross_bench_jaccard}\n\nTo test whether Jaccard saturation is specific to LAMBADA or a general property, we compute mean pairwise Jaccard trajectories across all four hybrid attention ratios on all four main benchmarks. Table~\\ref{tab:cross_bench_jaccard} reports the results. On every benchmark, Jaccard shows no statistically significant trend with attention ratio (all $\\rho \\leq 0.80$, $p \\geq 0.333$), with values uniformly between 0.08 and 0.11. The saturation at the first attention level observed on LAMBADA (\\S\\ref{ssec:decoupling}) thus generalizes: once any attention is present, each architecture's per-example response is largely fixed regardless of attention ratio.\n\n\\begin{table}[ht]\n\\centering\n\\small\n\\caption{Mean pairwise Jaccard (mean of helped and hurt sets, 3 architecture pairs) across attention ratios and benchmarks (1.3B scale). $\\rho$: Spearman correlation between attention ratio and $\\bar{J}$.

To verify that low cross-architecture Jaccard is not an artifact of this binarization, we compute Jaccard similarity using a continuous confidence threshold $\\tau$: two architectures' effect sets are defined as the examples whose target-token $|\\log p|$ changes by more than $\\tau$ when attention is added. On LAMBADA, mean pairwise Jaccard decreases monotonically from 0.26 ($\\tau = 0.00$, any change) to 0.05 ($\\tau = 0.30$, large changes only). ARC-Easy and PIQA show the same monotonic decrease. The binary threshold ($\\tau = 0$, correctness flip) thus represents the upper end of cross-architecture overlap; restricting to confident transitions further reduces agreement, confirming that low Jaccard is robust to the choice of binarization threshold.\n\n\\section{Target-Token Confidence Margin}\n\\label{app:confidence_margin}\n\nWe analyze whether pure-model confidence on the target token predicts whether attention will help or hurt on a given example.\nWe define confidence as $|\\log p_{\\text{pure}}(y^*)|$, where $y^*$ is the target token: lower values indicate higher probability (near-correct).\nWe initially tested raw perplexity as a predictor of helped/hurt status, but found that within-category controls (C1/C2) are necessary to isolate attention effects from the definitional confound between pure-correct and pure-wrong populations.\n\nTable~\\ref{tab:cm_c1} compares hurt versus stayed-right samples (both pure-correct): hurt samples have significantly lower target-token probability (higher $|\\log p|$), confirming that weakly-correct predictions are vulnerable to attention disruption.\nTable~\\ref{tab:cm_c2} compares helped versus stayed-wrong samples (both pure-wrong): helped samples have higher target-token probability (lower $|\\log p|$), confirming that near-miss errors are rescuable.\nThis pattern is consistent across all three architectures ($|d| = 0.73$--$0.92$, all $p < 10^{-54}$) but does not alter the cross-architecture Jaccard findings---within-architecture predictability coexists with cross-architecture divergence.\n\n\\begin{table}[ht]\n\\centering\n\\caption{Control 1: Pure-correct samples---hurt vs.\\ stayed-right.

Table~\\ref{tab:cm_cross_c2} reports the rescue analysis (helped vs.\\ stayed-wrong) on HellaSwag and ARC-Easy. All nine comparisons (three benchmarks $\\times$ three architectures) are significant, confirming that attention consistently rescues near-miss errors regardless of task type. Effect sizes range from small on HellaSwag ($d = 0.13$--$0.17$) to medium on ARC-Easy ($d = 0.51$--$0.60$), compared to large on LAMBADA ($d = 0.73$--$0.77$); the attenuation on HellaSwag reflects noisier confidence proxies under length-normalized scoring. Table~\\ref{tab:cm_cross_c1} reports the disruption analysis (hurt vs.\\ stayed-right); two of six comparisons are significant (all on ARC-Easy) with small effect sizes ($d = 0.13$--$0.26$), indicating that the disruption signal is weaker on multiple-choice tasks and absent on HellaSwag under \\texttt{acc\\_norm}. The asymmetry between rescue and disruption reflects task structure: near-miss errors are an intrinsic sample property (the model almost produced the correct answer regardless of format), while borderline correctness in multiple-choice settings depends on relative option ranking rather than absolute confidence, reducing the raw log-likelihood margin's predictive power for vulnerability.\n\n\\begin{table}[ht]\n\\centering\n\\caption{Cross-benchmark rescue analysis (Control 2): helped vs.\\ stayed-wrong on HellaSwag and ARC-Easy (1.3B h3-1).}\n\\label{tab:cm_cross_c2}\n\\resizebox{\\columnwidth}{!}{%\n\\begin{tabular}{llrr}\n\\toprule\nBenchmark & Architecture & Cohen's $d$ & $p$ \\\\\n\\midrule\nHellaSwag & GDN & $-$0.166 & $6.1 \\times 10^{-4}$ \\\\\n & RetNet & $-$0.132 & $1.4 \\times 10^{-2}$ \\\\\n & HGRN2 & $-$0.164 & $1.4 \\times 10^{-3}$ \\\\\n\\midrule\nARC-Easy & GDN & $-$0.60 & $1.0 \\times 10^{-13}$ \\\\\n & RetNet & $-$0.51 & $5.3 \\times 10^{-10}$ \\\\\n & HGRN2 & $-$0.53 & $5.4 \\times 10^{-10}$ \\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}%\n}\n\\end{table}\n\n\\begin{table}[ht]\n\\centering\n\\caption{Cross-benchmark disruption analysis (Control 1): hurt vs.\\ stayed-right on HellaSwag and ARC-Easy (1.3B h3-1).}\n\\label{tab:cm_cross_c1}\n\\resizebox{\\columnwidth}{!}{%\n\\begin{tabular}{llrrl}\n\\toprule\nBenchmark & Architecture & Cohen's $d$ & $p$ & Sig.? \\\\\n\\midrule\nHellaSwag & GDN & 0.009 & .999 & No \\\\\n & RetNet & $-$0.035 & .453 & No \\\\\n & HGRN2 & $-$0.062 & .274 & No \\\\\n\\midrule\nARC-Easy & GDN & 0.26 & $3.2 \\times 10^{-4}$ & Yes \\\\\n & RetNet & 0.22 & $2.8 \\times 10^{-3}$ & Yes \\\\\n & HGRN2 & 0.13 & .145 & No \\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}%\n}\n\\end{table}\n\n\\subsection{Prediction Framework}\\label{app:prediction_framework}\n\nWe formalize the confidence margin analysis as a binary prediction task: given a pure-model example and its target-token $|\\log p|$, predict whether attention will change the example's correctness. Using the within-category summary statistics (Tables~\\ref{tab:cm_c1},~\\ref{tab:cm_c2}), we derive analytic AUC from Cohen's $d$ via $\\text{AUC} = \\Phi(|d|/\\sqrt{2})$ and compute Gaussian-intersection thresholds (the $|\\log p|$ value at which the two group densities intersect under equal priors).\n\nTable~\\ref{tab:prediction_auc} reports within-architecture prediction performance. All AUCs exceed 0.69, confirming that pure-model confidence is a reliable within-architecture predictor of attention effects. Disruption prediction is consistently stronger than rescue (mean AUC 0.73 vs.\\ 0.70), reflecting the larger effect sizes in Control~1.\n\n\\begin{table}[ht]\n\\centering\n\\small\n\\caption{Within-architecture prediction of attention effects on LAMBADA (1.3B).

Disruption-set $|\\log p|$ values show mild skewness (0.53--0.77, $W \\in [0.955, 0.973]$), closely approximating a normal distribution at the sample sizes involved. Rescue-set values are moderately right-skewed (skewness 1.33--1.41, $W \\in [0.899, 0.920]$), following an approximately log-normal distribution. Because the skew is one-sided, parametric AUC estimates (0.70--0.74 in the main text) are conservative lower bounds; non-parametric empirical AUC from the same data yields 0.73--0.77.\n\nDespite similar within-architecture AUC, the optimal prediction thresholds differ across architectures for disruption but not rescue (Table~\\ref{tab:threshold_gap}). Rescue thresholds cluster tightly (range 0.03 in $|\\log p|$), indicating that the rescuability boundary---the confidence level below which pure-wrong examples are likely to be corrected by attention---is architecture-invariant. Disruption thresholds span a 47\\% relative range (GDN: 0.70, RetNet: 1.00, HGRN2: 1.14), meaning that the same confidence level on a pure-correct example may predict vulnerability in one architecture but safety in another. This asymmetry constitutes a second dimension of multiplicity beyond per-example disagreement: all three architectures agree on which wrong answers are rescuable, but disagree on which correct answers are vulnerable to disruption.\n\n\\begin{table}[ht]\n\\centering\n\\small\n\\caption{Gaussian-intersection prediction thresholds ($|\\log p|$) across architectures.

We compute expected calibration error (ECE; \\citealt{guo2017calibration}) for each architecture's h3-1 model on LAMBADA using 15 equal-width bins. ECE values are similar: GDN 0.222, RetNet 0.224, HGRN2 0.235. The cross-architecture ECE spread (6\\%, computed as range/mean) is less than half the disruption threshold spread (47\\%; Table~\\ref{tab:threshold_gap}), indicating that calibration differences are insufficient to account for the observed threshold divergence. Rescue thresholds, which show only 1\\% cross-architecture spread, are consistent with near-identical calibration in the low-confidence regime.\n\n\\section{BoolQ Supplementary Analysis}\n\\label{app:boolq}\n\nBoolQ ($N = 3{,}270$; comprehension, binary yes/no classification) shows the highest ambiguity among the benchmarks we analyzed ($\\alpha \\approx 0.45$), but the Jaccard significance pattern is mixed: only 12 of 24 architecture $\\times$ attention-ratio pair combinations yield $p < .01$. In particular, the RetNet--HGRN2 pair produces 0/8 significant Jaccard values, with several normalized effect sizes below zero, suggesting anti-correlated per-example effects for this pair.\n\n\\paragraph{Binary classification baseline.} BoolQ is binary classification (two answer choices), whereas LAMBADA, HellaSwag, and ARC-Easy involve open vocabulary prediction or four-way multiple choice. Under a binary task, the null Jaccard baseline $J_{\\text{null}}$ is higher because chance overlap between helped/hurt sets is larger when there are fewer ways to be wrong. This elevates the significance threshold: observed Jaccard must be substantially higher to exceed the null, which explains why 12/24 pairs fail to reach significance despite $\\bar{J}_h = 0.103$ and $\\bar{J}_u = 0.098$---values comparable to the four main benchmarks.\n\n\\paragraph{Per-example summary.} Table~\\ref{tab:boolq_multiplicity} reports the key metrics. The high $\\alpha$ reflects that BoolQ examples are more sensitive to architectural variation in the presence of attention: approximately half of all examples change correctness status for at least one architecture. However, the mixed Jaccard significance prevents us from confidently concluding that the cross-architecture overlap structure matches the pattern observed on the four main benchmarks.\n\n\\begin{table}[ht]\n\\centering\n\\small\n\\caption{BoolQ predictive multiplicity at 1.3B (h3-1).}\n\\label{tab:boolq_multiplicity}\n\\begin{tabular}{@{}lcccccc@{}}\n\\toprule\n & $N$ & $\\alpha$ & $\\bar{J}_{h}$ & $\\bar{J}_{u}$ & Sig.\\ pairs & $\\rho_\\alpha$ \\\\\n\\midrule\nBoolQ & 3270 & .45 & .103 & .098 & 12/24 & $+0.1$ \\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}\n\\par\\vspace{1pt}\n{\\footnotesize RetNet--HGRN2: 0/8 significant; multiple normalized ES $< 0$.}\n\\end{table}\n\nThe significant Jaccard overlap concentrates in GDN--RetNet pairs (8/8 significant), while RetNet--HGRN2 shows none (0/8). This pair-specificity does not appear on the four main benchmarks, where all architecture pairs show significant overlap; it may reflect a BoolQ-specific interaction between binary classification structure and particular recurrent architectures rather than a general property of architecture pairs.\n\n\\paragraph{Confidence margin.} Confidence margin analysis on BoolQ shows the rescue pattern (C2) partially holds (2/3 architectures significant, $d = 0.16$--$0.36$) but the disruption pattern (C1) is absent (0/3, $|d| \\leq 0.10$), consistent with compressed log-likelihood ranges in binary classification reducing the predictive power of confidence margins. This extends the gradient observed across LAMBADA, ARC-Easy, and HellaSwag: C1 effect sizes decrease from open-ended prediction ($d \\approx 0.9$, LAMBADA) through ARC-Easy ($d \\approx 0.1$--$0.3$) to HellaSwag ($d \\approx 0$ under \\texttt{acc\\_norm}) and binary classification ($d \\approx 0$, BoolQ). The gradient broadly tracks the coefficient of variation (CV) of the log-likelihood confidence proxy: LAMBADA ($\\text{CV} = 0.75$) $>$ ARC-Easy ($0.54$) $>$ HellaSwag ($0.49$) $>$ BoolQ ($0.22$). BoolQ's high-frequency short completions (``\\,yes''/``\\,no'') yield elevated baseline log-likelihoods (mean $|\\text{loglik}| = 3.04$ vs.\\ $0.84$ for LAMBADA) with similar absolute spread (IQR $\\approx 0.9$), compressing the relative variation and rendering the confidence margin unable to separate borderline-correct from robustly-correct examples.\n\n\\paragraph{Interpretation.} The RetNet--HGRN2 anti-correlation may reflect different error modes specific to binary classification: when one architecture's recurrent state resolves a yes/no ambiguity through attention, the other architecture's resolution may be disrupted by the same attention intervention. This pattern warrants further investigation with additional binary classification benchmarks to determine whether it is BoolQ-specific or characteristic of two-choice tasks more broadly.\n\n\\section{WinoGrande Supplementary Analysis}\n\\label{app:winogrande}\n\nWinoGrande ($N = 1{,}267$; reasoning, two-choice coreference resolution) shows high ambiguity ($\\alpha \\approx 0.41$ at h3-1) but mixed Jaccard significance: 10 of 24 architecture $\\times$ attention-ratio pair combinations yield $p < .01$. Mean pairwise Jaccard ($\\bar{J}_h = 0.110$, $\\bar{J}_u = 0.103$) is comparable to the four main benchmarks, but the elevated null baseline from near-chance accuracy (${\\sim}60\\%$) reduces statistical power to detect above-chance overlap.\n\n\\paragraph{Near-chance accuracy.} WinoGrande accuracy across hybrid configurations ranges from 59\\% to 62\\%, close to the two-choice chance level of 50\\%. At near-chance accuracy, a large fraction of examples are borderline---small perturbations (such as adding attention) can flip predictions in either direction, inflating the helped and hurt sets and consequently $\\alpha$. This structural property, shared with BoolQ (${\\sim}59\\%$ accuracy, $\\alpha \\approx 0.45$), may partially explain the elevated $\\alpha$ rather than task-intrinsic multiplicity. PIQA (73\\% accuracy, $\\alpha = 0.14$) and HellaSwag (60\\% normalized accuracy, $\\alpha = 0.15$) demonstrate that near-chance accuracy is not the sole driver, but we cannot fully exclude it as a contributing factor for WinoGrande and BoolQ.\n\n\\begin{table}[ht]\n\\centering\n\\small\n\\caption{WinoGrande predictive multiplicity at 1.3B (h3-1).}\n\\label{tab:winogrande_multiplicity}\n\\resizebox{\\columnwidth}{!}{%\n\\begin{tabular}{@{}lcccccc@{}}\n\\toprule\n & $N$ & $\\alpha$ & $\\bar{J}_{h}$ & $\\bar{J}_{u}$ & Sig.\\ pairs & $\\rho_\\alpha$ \\\\\n\\midrule\nWinoGrande & 1267 & .41 & .110 & .103 & 10/24 & $-0.9$ \\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}}\n\\par\\vspace{1pt}\n{\\footnotesize $\\alpha$ variation across ratios: 0.054 ($> 0.03$ threshold of main benchmarks).}\n\\end{table}\n\n\\section{340M Per-Example Analysis}\\label{app:scale_per_example}\n\n\\subsection{LAMBADA}\n\nAt 340M, LAMBADA per-example multiplicity closely matches the 1.3B pattern: $\\alpha = 0.313$ (vs.\\ 0.307 at 1.3B), with mean pairwise Jaccard $\\bar{J} \\approx 0.089$ (vs.\\ 0.095). Per-example directionality is preserved: HGRN2 shows net positive effects at h3-1 ($+238$ examples), while GDN ($-256$) and RetNet ($-106$) show net negative effects, mirroring the 1.3B profile (HGRN2 $+153$, GDN $-153$, RetNet $-69$).\n\nHowever, aggregate convergence is absent at 340M: $\\rho = -0.50$ ($p = .45$), with non-monotonic $\\sigma$ across attention ratios ($0.025 \\to 0.012 \\to 0.018 \\to 0.011 \\to 0.016$). This contrasts sharply with 1.3B ($\\rho = -1.0$, $p = .017$, monotonic $\\sigma$ decrease). The decoupling between per-example divergence and aggregate convergence thus manifests differently across scales: at 340M, per-example multiplicity is present but aggregate convergence is not, suggesting that convergence requires sufficient model capacity while multiplicity does not.\n\nWithin-benchmark $\\alpha$ variation across attention ratios is also larger at 340M (0.047, from 0.313 at pure to 0.266 at h3-1) than at 1.3B ($< 0.03$; \\S\\ref{ssec:per_example}), suggesting that smaller models are more sensitive to the attention ratio in terms of per-example disagreement patterns.\n\n\\begin{table}[ht]\n\\centering\n\\small\n\\caption{340M vs.\\ 1.3B LAMBADA comparison.}\n\\label{tab:scale_comparison}\n\\begin{tabular}{@{}lcc@{}}\n\\toprule\n & 340M & 1.3B \\\\\n\\midrule\n$\\alpha$ (pure) & .313 & .307 \\\\\n$\\bar{J}$ (h3-1) & .089 & .095 \\\\\n$\\rho_\\sigma$ & $-0.50$ & $-1.0$ \\\\\n$p$ & .45 & .017 \\\\\nGDN net & $-256$ & $-153$ \\\\\nHGRN2 net & $+238$ & $+153$ \\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\n\n\\subsection{Cross-Benchmark Scale Comparison}\n\nTable~\\ref{tab:340m_multi_bench} extends the scale comparison to all four main benchmarks. Two patterns emerge. First, $\\alpha$ is systematically higher at 340M across all benchmarks, with the largest gap on ARC-Easy ($+$8.4pp) and the smallest on LAMBADA ($+$0.6pp). Second, pairwise Jaccard remains stable across scales ($\\bar{J}_h = 0.08$--$0.10$ at both scales); three-architecture results are stable across both 340M and 1.3B scales (Jaccard $\\approx$ 0.08--0.10), providing indirect support for consistency across these two scales. This suggests that the qualitative pattern of per-example multiplicity---which architectures affect which examples---is consistent across the two scales examined, even as its magnitude increases at smaller scale. Notably, the $\\alpha$ inflation does not track accuracy loss: HellaSwag has the largest accuracy gap between scales yet the smallest $\\Delta\\alpha$ ($+$1.9pp), while ARC-Easy has a smaller accuracy gap but the largest $\\Delta\\alpha$ ($+$8.4pp), arguing against accuracy as the primary driver of scale-dependent multiplicity.\n\n\\begin{table}[ht]\n\\centering\n\\small\n\\caption{340M vs.\\ 1.3B per-example multiplicity across four benchmarks. $\\alpha$: ambiguity at pure-recurrent configuration.

Majority vote benefits only from 2/3 examples (where the correct answer holds a majority) but is actively harmed by 1/3 examples (where the correct architecture is outvoted). On LAMBADA, HellaSwag, and ARC-Easy, the MV exploitation ratio---the fraction of complementary examples where MV selects correctly---hovers near 51\\%, indicating a near-even split between MV-exploitable and MV-hostile disagreements. The oracle, by contrast, exploits both categories, explaining the large oracle--MV gap ($+7$--$14$\\,pp).\n\n\\begin{table}[ht]\n\\centering\n\\small\n\\caption{Complementarity decomposition at 1.3B h3-1.

Attention changes neither the amount nor the structure of cross-architecture complementarity.\n\n\\section{Seed-Variation Calibration}\\label{app:seed_calibration}\n\nTo contextualize the $3\\times$ within- vs.\\ cross-architecture Jaccard gap (\\S\\ref{ssec:decoupling}), we compare against within-seed variation using the Pythia 70M \\citep{biderman2023pythia} PolyPythias models \\citep{vanderwal2025polypythias}, which provide 9 individually trained seeds of the same architecture.\n\nOn LAMBADA ($N = 5{,}153$), within-seed mean Jaccard is $\\bar{J}_h = 0.273$ (helped) and $\\bar{J}_u = 0.393$ (hurt), compared to our cross-architecture reference $J \\approx 0.10$. On ARC-Easy ($N = 2{,}376$), within-seed $\\bar{J}_h = 0.312$ and $\\bar{J}_u = 0.354$, versus cross-architecture $J \\approx 0.092$. Within-seed ambiguity is $\\alpha = 0.36$ (LAMBADA) and $\\alpha = 0.49$ (ARC-Easy), compared to cross-architecture $\\alpha = 0.30$ and $0.21$ respectively.\n\nSeeds thus produce comparable or higher amounts of per-example disagreement ($\\alpha$) but on more overlapping examples (higher $J$). Cross-architecture variation is associated with per-example effects on less overlapping examples (lower $J$), consistent with architecture-driven divergence yielding qualitatively different per-example patterns than seed noise. The within-seed Jaccard is 2.7--4.3$\\times$ higher than cross-architecture Jaccard across both benchmarks.\n\nThree caveats qualify this comparison. First, scale mismatch: Pythia 70M is $5\\times$ smaller than our smallest models (340M); attempts to use Pythia 410M failed repeatedly. Second, architecture family: Pythia is a standard Transformer, not a hybrid recurrent architecture, so this is a cross-family reference point rather than a matched control. Third, accuracy regime: Pythia 70M accuracy (LAMBADA 0.17--0.23, ARC-Easy ${\\sim}$0.38) is far below our models (${\\sim}$0.50, ${\\sim}$0.72), and Jaccard is affected by base rates; the 2.7--4.3$\\times$ ratio may differ at accuracy regimes closer to our main experiments. These limitations restrict the comparison to a reference point for seed-variation magnitude rather than definitive evidence for architecture-driven effects.\n\n\\section{Extended Architecture Validation (Five Architectures)}\\label{app:extended_arch}\n\nTo test whether the low cross-architecture Jaccard pattern generalizes beyond the three primary architectures, we extend the analysis to include two additional architectures from the same model zoo: GLA (Gated Linear Attention) and DeltaNet, yielding ten pairwise comparisons. Both are available only at 340M in the model zoo; all results below use the h3-1 (25\\% attention) configuration. This extension validates per-example divergence (not aggregate convergence).\n\n\\begin{center}\n\\small\n\\captionof{table}{Pairwise Jaccard similarity across five architectures (340M, h3-1).

The seven new pairs involving GLA and DeltaNet show no systematic difference from the original three pairs (Mann-Whitney $p > .3$ for both helped and hurt), indicating that the low-overlap pattern is not specific to the original architecture triple. A sixth architecture (HGRN; \\citealp{qin2023hierarchically}) is also available in the zoo but excluded from the main analysis: its substantially lower baseline accuracy on LAMBADA (0.263 vs.\\ 0.32--0.38 for the other five) mechanically inflates helped-set sizes and Jaccard values. All 15 six-architecture permutation tests nonetheless remain significant ($z \\geq 2.9$, $p \\leq .006$). The same pattern holds on HellaSwag ($N = 10{,}042$) and PIQA ($N = 1{,}838$): all 20 additional pairwise tests yield $p < .01$ with mean $J_{\\text{helped}} \\leq 0.10$. Full four-benchmark and six-architecture data are included in our code release.\n\n\\section{Use of AI Assistants}\n\\label{app:ai-assistants}\n\nWe used Claude (Anthropic) as an AI coding and writing assistant\nthroughout this work.

<details><summary>Logged reasoning block</summary>

```text
Good. Now I have a complete picture of all files. Let me start making the 6 edits:

1. **\cite → \citep/\citet**: Already using \citep/\citet everywhere — the grep found no `\cite{` matches (without p/t). ✅ Done already.

2. **Title change**: "Per-Example Predictive Multiplicity in Hybrid Linear Recurrent Architectures" → Something with a hook. User suggestion: "Aggregate Equivalence ≠ Behavioral Equivalence: ..."

3. **Abstract negative caveat**: Change last sentence.


4. **Introduction paragraph 1**: Too dense with numbers. Simplify.
5. **Introduction paragraphs 4-5**: Central finding hierarchy.
6. **Limitations "Single training runs"**: Compress.

Let me work through these one by one. First, the citations are already fixed — grep confirmed no bare `\cite{` commands exist. For the title, I need to replace the current phrasing with something catchier that emphasizes the core tension between aggregate and individual-level behavior. I'm looking at the proposed direction with "Aggregate Equivalence ≠ Behavioral Equivalence" as the hook.

For the abstract's final sentence, the user wants me to tighten the language around how routing exploits complementarity. Instead of the current phrasing about preliminary routing being partially effective, I should reframe it to acknowledge the complementarity exists but remains task-dependent. Let me revise that closing to be more direct about this limitation.

Now looking at the introduction structure—there's a hierarchy problem between paragraphs 4 and 5. Paragraph 4 presents "per-example overlap remains flat" as the central finding, but then paragraph 5 introduces two findings as if they're equally primary. I need to reframe this so the overarching pattern of structured multiplicity is the main insight, with the two specific manifestations flowing from that.

The opening paragraph is also too dense with numbers. I should strip back the quantitative details and focus on the conceptual motivation instead.

For the limitations section on single training runs, I'm compressing the technical details about seed effects and statistical significance into plain language—the key point is that while we can't fully separate architectural from seed effects with single runs, the consistency across combinations and the within-seed calibration evidence suggest the patterns are robust. Looking at the statistical result about LAMBADA's p-value and how it relates to the broader consistency findings across conditions, the key insight is that while this single run doesn't reach significance on its own, the pattern holds up across the 40 conditions tested. The variance across these runs shows a coefficient of variation around 0.017, which calibrates how much fluctuation we're seeing in the effect sizes. by gaining and losing on different inputs. Across all pairwise comparisons, per-example overlap stays below 14%, suggesting that architecture choice fundamentally determines which specific inputs the system handles correctly.

Now I'm restructuring the introduction to clarify the hierarchy of findings. The central claim should emphasize that architectures appearing equivalent in aggregate benchmarks actually affect systematically different examples, with this pattern then broken down into two specific manifestations in the next paragraph. The central finding should be that architectural variation produces systematically different per-example predictions across tasks, with the saturation pattern at 4% overlap serving as supporting evidence of this mechanism. I'm restructuring paragraph 4 to establish this hierarchy clearly, then using paragraph 5 to develop both dimensions—the task-dependent variation as the main insight and the saturation behavior as the secondary pattern that explains how this multiplicity manifests.

Now I'm compressing the limitations section on single training runs. The key points are that we have only one run per configuration, but the consistency across all 40 combinations and the large within- versus cross-architecture gap provide strong evidence that this isn't just noise. The seed calibration data and statistical thresholds matter less than establishing that the pattern is robust despite this limitation. I'm organizing the edits across multiple files—starting with the main.tex changes for the title, abstract, and limitations section, then moving to introduction.tex for the paragraph restructuring. I can parallelize edits that affect different files, but I need to handle sequential changes within the same file carefully. Let me think through the title formatting too, since LaTeX has specific conventions for line breaks in titles. I'm revising the abstract to clarify that while low cross-architecture overlap suggests complementarity, routing-based approaches only show task-dependent benefits rather than consistent gains. For the limitations section, I need to acknowledge that each configuration ran only once, so I can't fully separate architectural effects from seed-specific variation—though the substantial within-seed versus cross-architecture Jaccard gap and consistency across all benchmark combinations suggest the findings aren't just noise, and the statistical threshold with five attention ratios supports this conclusion. I'm restructuring the transition between paragraphs 4 and 5—shifting the focus from "central finding" to emphasize the overall pattern of multiplicity, then reframing paragraph 5 to present one primary finding about architectural variation producing structured predictive multiplicity with specific metrics on ambiguity and Jaccard overlap, followed by a supporting observation about saturation at the first attention level. I'm looking at the specific benchmarks where we conduct per-example decompositions—LAMBADA, HellaSwag, PIQA, and ARC-Easy—and how we classify each example as helped, hurt, or unchanged when attention is added, then measure the cross-architecture overlap using Jaccard similarity to show that per-example agreement stays flat despite changes in aggregate variance. Now I'm moving into the key findings, starting with how predictive multiplicity varies across tasks, with ambiguity ranging from 0.14 to 0.15 across different benchmarks.

The ambiguity metric shows meaningful variation across task types—ranging from 0.14 in PIQA up to 0.30 in LAMBADA—while pairwise Jaccard similarity stays consistently low across all benchmarks, and within each task the ambiguity remains stable across different attention ratios but differs roughly twofold between reasoning and retrieval tasks. More importantly, per-example overlap saturates immediately at the lowest attention level and doesn't change meaningfully at higher ratios, with only LAMBADA showing a non-significant decreasing pattern in aggregate variance, yet even there the per-example Jaccard similarity remains flat while the aggregate variance shifts. I'm refining the language to make the central finding clearer—the key insight is that while models look equivalent in aggregate metrics, they actually diverge substantially when you examine individual examples, and this divergence emerges even with minimal attention. For the second part, I'm restructuring to emphasize that task type (not attention ratio) drives the magnitude of this multiplicity, with ambiguity ranging across benchmarks but staying consistent within each one regardless of attention levels. Looking at the statistical patterns across these hybrid architectures—they cluster tightly in aggregate performance but diverge dramatically on individual examples, with pairwise overlap staying below 14% despite similar overall scores. This means different architectures succeed and fail on largely different inputs, making the architectural choice consequential for which specific examples get handled correctly. Now I'm moving forward with applying these edits across the main document and introduction sections.

38	\begin{abstract}
39	Hybrid linear recurrent architectures that appear interchangeable by aggregate benchmarks can differ on which specific examples they handle correctly. Using a controlled model zoo \citep{wang2025hybrid} (three architectures, five attention ratios, two scales), we decompose per-example effects of adding attention and find structured predictive multiplicity \citep{marx2020predictive}: pairwise overlap of helped and hurt example sets is uniformly low (Jaccard $\approx 0.10$, roughly twice the independence baseline; all $p < .01$ across five architectures). This multiplicity varies by task type or evaluation format ($\alpha = 0.14$--$0.30$) rather than attention ratio. Per-example overlap saturates at 4\% attention and remains flat across higher ratios, indicating that minimal attention establishes which examples each architecture affects. \citet{yang2026benchmark} document analogous per-item disagreement (16--66\%) among frontier large language models (LLMs) despite comparable aggregate scores; our within-family design isolates backbone variation from training-regime differences. Confidence margins partially predict affected examples (area under the ROC curve [AUC] 0.70--0.74). Preliminary routing partially exploits this complementarity on one benchmark but is counterproductive on others.

52	\section*{Limitations}
53	
54	\paragraph{Single training runs.} Each configuration corresponds to a single training run, so architectural and seed-specific effects cannot be fully disentangled. The $3\times$ within- vs.\ cross-architecture Jaccard gap and Pythia 70M seed calibration (within-seed $J$ is 2.7--4.3$\times$ higher; Appendix~\ref{app:seed_calibration}) provide proxy evidence, and consistency across all 40 architecture--benchmark combinations (all $p < .01$) would be unlikely under seed noise alone. With $n = 5$ attention ratios, the minimum achievable $p$ is 0.017, so LAMBADA's Bonferroni-adjusted $p = .170$ does not reach conventional significance.
55	
56	\paragraph{Format confound.} The confound between task type and evaluation format cannot be fully resolved: LAMBADA is the only free-form benchmark, so its higher $\alpha$ may reflect format differences rather than cognitive demands alone.
57	
58	\paragraph{Coverage.} We examine three primary architectures (plus two extended) from one model zoo, four main benchmarks, and two scale points. Generalization to Mamba, RWKV, other hybrid families, and generation tasks remains open; all four per-example benchmarks use discriminative scoring, so multiplicity under open-ended generation is untested. Results at larger scales (e.g., 7B+) may differ, particularly as attention mechanisms become more expressive with increased capacity.
59	
60	\paragraph{Pre-training only.} All evaluations use pretrained checkpoints without fine-tuning; per-example effects may not persist after task-specific adaptation. All evaluations use greedy decoding (the lm-eval-harness default); sampling strategies may alter per-example agreement patterns.
61	
62	\section*{Code and Data Availability}
63	
64	All models are from the publicly available model zoo of \citet{wang2025hybrid}. Our analysis code and per-example evaluation outputs will be released upon publication.

1	\section{Introduction}
2	
3	Hybrid linear recurrent architectures---including GatedDeltaNet (GDN), RetNet, HGRN2, Gated Linear Attention (GLA), and DeltaNet---achieve aggregate benchmark scores within 1--2 points of each other at matched parameter budgets. Yet they can differ on up to 90\% of the individual examples they affect: adding attention to three controlled linear recurrent backbones yields helped and hurt sets with at most 10\% pairwise overlap, approximately twice the independence baseline. This per-example divergence is invisible in aggregate metrics: architectures that score within 1--2 points of each other reach similar accuracy by gaining and losing on different inputs. Across all ten pairwise comparisons among five architectures, overlap in per-example effects remains below 14\% (all $p < .01$), meaning the choice of backbone is associated with which specific inputs a deployed system handles correctly.
4	
5	This tension arises in the context of a rapid architectural shift toward hybrid recurrent-attention models, which interleave attention layers within linear recurrent backbones. Jamba \citep{lieber2024jamba}, Griffin \citep{de2024griffin}, RWKV-6 \citep{peng2024eagle}, and RecurrentGemma \citep{botev2024recurrentgemma} each combine recurrence with attention using different mixing strategies. These systems now serve as production-grade alternatives to pure Transformers, and the practical question of how much attention to include is typically answered by comparing aggregate benchmark numbers. \citet{wang2025hybrid} provide a controlled model zoo spanning three recurrent architectures, five attention ratios, and two parameter scales, which enables systematic study of how attention allocation affects these hybrid designs.
6	
7	Prior work on predictive multiplicity \citep{marx2020predictive} and underspecification \citep{damour2022underspecification,mccoy2020berts} documents this risk for seed variation within a single architecture, but whether it extends to architectural variation in hybrid recurrent models remains open. If architectures that score similarly in aggregate behave differently on individual inputs, the backbone choice carries hidden consequences for deployment reliability and ensemble construction.
8	
9	We present the first controlled within-family per-example analysis of how attention affects cross-architecture agreement in hybrid recurrent models. Using the model zoo of \citet{wang2025hybrid}, we compare three architectures---GatedDeltaNet (gated delta rules), RetNet (multi-scale exponential decay), and HGRN2 (gated state expansion)---at five attention ratios (0--25\%) and two scales (340M, 1.3B). We evaluate all 30 configurations on 10 benchmarks spanning retrieval, comprehension, reasoning, and mixed categories. On four benchmarks (LAMBADA, $N = 5{,}153$; HellaSwag, $N = 10{,}042$; PIQA, $N = 1{,}838$; ARC-Easy, $N = 2{,}376$) we conduct per-example decompositions, classifying each example as helped, hurt, or unchanged when attention is added, and measure cross-architecture overlap via Jaccard similarity. Figure~\ref{fig:decoupling} previews our central finding: per-example overlap remains flat even as aggregate variance changes.

(a,\,b) LAMBADA: cross-architecture $\sigma$ shows a non-significant decreasing trend at 1.3B (solid; Bonferroni-adjusted $p = .170$) but partially rebounds at 340M (dashed), while pairwise Jaccard of helped/hurt sets saturates at 4\% attention and remains flat. (c) This saturation generalizes: on all four main benchmarks, mean pairwise $\bar{J}$ remains flat across attention ratios (all $\rho \leq 0.80$, $p \geq .333$). Shaded bands are illustrative ($n = 3$).}
23	\label{fig:decoupling}
24	\end{figure*}
25	
26	Our analysis yields two findings. First, per-example predictive multiplicity varies systematically across tasks. The ambiguity $\alpha$ \citep{marx2020predictive} ranges from 0.14 (PIQA) through 0.15 (HellaSwag) and 0.21 (ARC-Easy) to 0.30 (LAMBADA), while pairwise Jaccard remains uniformly low ($\leq 0.10$, all $p < .01$). Within each benchmark, $\alpha$ is stable across attention ratios (variation $< 0.03$) but differs $2\times$ across task types (reasoning to retrieval).
27	
28	Second, per-example overlap saturates at the first attention level (4\%) and is stable across higher ratios. Of 10 benchmarks, only LAMBADA shows a non-significant decreasing aggregate variance pattern ($\rho = -1.0$, Bonferroni-adjusted $p = .170$; observed at 1.3B, absent at 340M). Yet even on this benchmark, per-example Jaccard remains flat while aggregate variance changes (\S\ref{ssec:decoupling}).
29	
30	Our contributions are as follows:
31	\begin{itemize}
32	    \item Architectural variation in hybrid recurrent models---controlled within a single model zoo sharing training data and hyperparameters---produces structured predictive multiplicity whose magnitude varies by task type (or evaluation format) rather than attention ratio (\S\ref{ssec:per_example}). Five-architecture validation confirms the pattern (\S\ref{ssec:robustness}; Appendix~\ref{app:extended_arch}).
33	    \item Per-example overlap saturates at the first attention level (4\%) across all four benchmarks: minimal attention establishes which examples each architecture affects, and additional attention does not homogenize these per-example sets (\S\ref{ssec:decoupling}).
34	\end{itemize}

If architectures that score similarly in aggregate behave differently on individual inputs, the backbone choice carries hidden consequences for deployment reliability and ensemble construction.\n\nWe present the first controlled within-family per-example analysis of how attention affects cross-architecture agreement in hybrid recurrent models. Using the model zoo of \\citet{wang2025hybrid}, we compare three architectures---GatedDeltaNet (gated delta rules), RetNet (multi-scale exponential decay), and HGRN2 (gated state expansion)---at five attention ratios (0--25\\%) and two scales (340M, 1.3B). We evaluate all 30 configurations on 10 benchmarks spanning retrieval, comprehension, reasoning, and mixed categories. On four benchmarks (LAMBADA, $N = 5{,}153$; HellaSwag, $N = 10{,}042$; PIQA, $N = 1{,}838$; ARC-Easy, $N = 2{,}376$) we conduct per-example decompositions, classifying each example as helped, hurt, or unchanged when attention is added, and measure cross-architecture overlap via Jaccard similarity. Figure~\\ref{fig:decoupling} previews our central finding: per-example overlap remains flat even as aggregate variance changes.\n\n\\begin{figure*}[t]\n\\centering\n\\begin{minipage}[t]{0.56\\textwidth}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{figures/fig1_decoupling_hero.pdf}\n\\end{minipage}%\n\\hfill\n\\begin{minipage}[t]{0.42\\textwidth}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{figures/fig4_jaccard_saturation.pdf}\n\\end{minipage}\n\\caption{Per-example overlap saturates at minimal attention across benchmarks.

(c) This saturation generalizes: on all four main benchmarks, mean pairwise $\\bar{J}$ remains flat across attention ratios (all $\\rho \\leq 0.80$, $p \\geq .333$). Shaded bands are illustrative ($n = 3$).}\n\\label{fig:decoupling}\n\\end{figure*}\n\nOur analysis yields two findings. First, per-example predictive multiplicity varies systematically across tasks. The ambiguity $\\alpha$ \\citep{marx2020predictive} ranges from 0.14 (PIQA) through 0.15 (HellaSwag) and 0.21 (ARC-Easy) to 0.30 (LAMBADA), while pairwise Jaccard remains uniformly low ($\\leq 0.10$, all $p < .01$). Within each benchmark, $\\alpha$ is stable across attention ratios (variation $< 0.03$) but differs $2\\times$ across task types (reasoning to retrieval).\n\nSecond, per-example overlap saturates at the first attention level (4\\%) and is stable across higher ratios. Of 10 benchmarks, only LAMBADA shows a non-significant decreasing aggregate variance pattern ($\\rho = -1.0$, Bonferroni-adjusted $p = .170$; observed at 1.3B, absent at 340M). Yet even on this benchmark, per-example Jaccard remains flat while aggregate variance changes (\\S\\ref{ssec:decoupling}).\n\nOur contributions are as follows:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item Architectural variation in hybrid recurrent models---controlled within a single model zoo sharing training data and hyperparameters---produces structured predictive multiplicity whose magnitude varies by task type (or evaluation format) rather than attention ratio (\\S\\ref{ssec:per_example}). Five-architecture validation confirms the pattern (\\S\\ref{ssec:robustness}; Appendix~\\ref{app:extended_arch}).\n    \\item Per-example overlap saturates at the first attention level (4\\%) across all four benchmarks: minimal attention establishes which examples each architecture affects, and additional attention does not homogenize these per-example sets (\\S\\ref{ssec:decoupling}).\n\\end{itemize}\n",

2	
3	Hybrid linear recurrent architectures---including GatedDeltaNet (GDN), RetNet, HGRN2, Gated Linear Attention (GLA), and DeltaNet---achieve aggregate benchmark scores within 1--2 points of each other at matched parameter budgets, yet they can differ on up to 90\% of the individual examples they affect. This per-example divergence is invisible in aggregate metrics: architectures that score similarly reach that score by gaining and losing on different inputs, and the choice of backbone carries hidden consequences for which specific examples a deployed system handles correctly.
4	
5	This tension arises in the context of a rapid architectural shift toward hybrid recurrent-attention models, which interleave attention layers within linear recurrent backbones. Jamba \citep{lieber2024jamba}, Griffin \citep{de2024griffin}, RWKV-6 \citep{peng2024eagle}, and RecurrentGemma \citep{botev2024recurrentgemma} each combine recurrence with attention using different mixing strategies. These systems now serve as production-grade alternatives to pure Transformers, and the practical question of how much attention to include is typically answered by comparing aggregate benchmark numbers. \citet{wang2025hybrid} provide a controlled model zoo spanning three recurrent architectures, five attention ratios, and two parameter scales, which enables systematic study of how attention allocation affects these hybrid designs.
6	
7	Prior work on predictive multiplicity \citep{marx2020predictive} and underspecification \citep{damour2022underspecification,mccoy2020berts} documents this risk for seed variation within a single architecture, but whether it extends to architectural variation in hybrid recurrent models remains open. If architectures that score similarly in aggregate behave differently on individual inputs, the backbone choice carries hidden consequences for deployment reliability and ensemble construction.
8	
9	We present the first controlled within-family per-example analysis of how attention affects cross-architecture agreement in hybrid recurrent models. Using the model zoo of \citet{wang2025hybrid}, we compare three architectures---GatedDeltaNet (gated delta rules), RetNet (multi-scale exponential decay), and HGRN2 (gated state expansion)---at five attention ratios (0--25\%) and two scales (340M, 1.3B). We evaluate all 30 configurations on 10 benchmarks spanning retrieval, comprehension, reasoning, and mixed categories. On four benchmarks (LAMBADA, $N = 5{,}153$; HellaSwag, $N = 10{,}042$; PIQA, $N = 1{,}838$; ARC-Easy, $N = 2{,}376$) we conduct per-example decompositions, classifying each example as helped, hurt, or unchanged when attention is added, and measure cross-architecture overlap via Jaccard similarity. Figure~\ref{fig:decoupling} previews our central finding: architectures that appear equivalent by aggregate benchmarks diverge systematically at the per-example level, and this divergence is established by minimal attention.

Figure~\\ref{fig:decoupling} previews our central finding: architectures that appear equivalent by aggregate benchmarks diverge systematically at the per-example level, and this divergence is established by minimal attention.\n\n\\begin{figure*}[t]\n\\centering\n\\begin{minipage}[t]{0.56\\textwidth}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{figures/fig1_decoupling_hero.pdf}\n\\end{minipage}%\n\\hfill\n\\begin{minipage}[t]{0.42\\textwidth}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{figures/fig4_jaccard_saturation.pdf}\n\\end{minipage}\n\\caption{Per-example overlap saturates at minimal attention across benchmarks. (a,\\,b) LAMBADA: cross-architecture $\\sigma$ shows a non-significant decreasing trend at 1.3B (solid; Bonferroni-adjusted $p = .170$) but partially rebounds at 340M (dashed), while pairwise Jaccard of helped/hurt sets saturates at 4\\% attention and remains flat. (c) This saturation generalizes: on all four main benchmarks, mean pairwise $\\bar{J}$ remains flat across attention ratios (all $\\rho \\leq 0.80$, $p \\geq .333$).

A supporting observation is that this per-example overlap saturates at the first attention level (4\\%) and remains flat at higher ratios---even on LAMBADA, where aggregate variance shows a non-significant decreasing trend ($\\rho = -1.0$, Bonferroni-adjusted $p = .170$; at 1.3B only), per-example Jaccard does not change (\\S\\ref{ssec:decoupling}).\n\nOur contributions are as follows:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item Architectural variation in hybrid recurrent models---controlled within a single model zoo sharing training data and hyperparameters---produces structured predictive multiplicity whose magnitude varies by task type (or evaluation format) rather than attention ratio (\\S\\ref{ssec:per_example}).

39	Hybrid linear recurrent architectures that appear interchangeable by aggregate benchmarks can differ on which specific examples they handle correctly. Using a controlled model zoo \citep{wang2025hybrid} (three architectures, five attention ratios, two scales), we decompose per-example effects of adding attention and find structured predictive multiplicity \citep{marx2020predictive}: pairwise overlap of helped and hurt example sets is uniformly low (Jaccard $\approx 0.10$, roughly twice the independence baseline; all $p < .01$ across five architectures). This multiplicity varies by task type or evaluation format ($\alpha = 0.14$--$0.30$) rather than attention ratio. Per-example overlap saturates at 4\% attention and remains flat across higher ratios, indicating that minimal attention establishes which examples each architecture affects. \citet{yang2026benchmark} document analogous per-item disagreement (16--66\%) among frontier large language models (LLMs) despite comparable aggregate scores; our within-family design isolates backbone variation from training-regime differences. Confidence margins partially predict affected examples (area under the ROC curve [AUC] 0.70--0.74). Low cross-architecture overlap implies substantial complementarity, though routing-based exploitation remains task-dependent.

```text
The compilation succeeded with 22 total pages. The page limit check fails because 22 > 8, but that's expected — the 22 pages include the appendix (which is unlimited). The main text is what matters for the 8-page limit. Since we previously verified the main text was 8 pages, and we only removed text (paragraph 1 simplification, limitations compression) and slightly modified other text, the main text should be at or under 8 pages. The critical thing is no compilation errors and no critical warnings — both are clean.

Let me count the abstract words to make sure we're under 200.

Let me count the words in the abstract:


I'm looking at the key findings from the model zoo analysis. We're seeing that these architectures behave differently on individual examples despite similar aggregate performance, with structured patterns in which examples benefit from added attention. The overlap between helped and hurt examples is surprisingly low across different architectures, and this variation depends more on task type than on attention ratio, with the effect plateauing at relatively low attention levels. The compilation looks good with no critical issues, and the 22-page total including the appendix is within limits. I need to check the main text page count though—the recent edits trimmed a couple sentences from the introduction and compressed the limitations section, which might have pushed us under the 8-page target. Let me render those pages to see where we stand.

```text
Looking at the pages:

**Page 1**: Title "Aggregate Equivalence ≠ Behavioral Equivalence: Per-Example Multiplicity in Hybrid Linear Recurrent Models" — looks great. The title has the catchy claim in front. Abstract looks clean. Introduction starts on the right column.

**Page 8**: Shows the end of main text — I can see Figure 5 (Jaccard heatmap), Figure 6 (Jaccard hierarchy), §4.3 Robustness section, and the start of §5 Conclusion. Conclusion is on this page, and below it starts the Limitations section. Wait, I need to check more carefully.


Looking at page 8 more closely, I see the Conclusion section at the top right, followed by Limitations. Checking page 9, it continues with the Limitations content (Format confound, Coverage, Pre-training only), then Code and Data Availability, and finally References. So the main text actually spans pages 1-9, which would be 9 pages total. But EMNLP's 8-page limit for main text doesn't count Limitations and references, so I need to verify whether Limitations is considered part of the main text or a separate section.

According to the EMNLP 2026 guidelines, Limitations are mandatory but don't count toward the 8-page limit. So the main text (everything up through Conclusion) should end before Limitations begins. Looking at page 8 again, Conclusion appears to wrap up the main content, and Limitations starts right after it on the same page. That means the main text fits within 8 pages, which is compliant. ✅

Now I need to verify the abstract word count. Let me count the words from the abstract text provided. The abstract discusses how hybrid linear recurrent architectures can differ on specific examples despite similar aggregate performance, using a controlled model zoo to decompose the effects of adding attention and finding structured predictive multiplicity with low pairwise overlap between helped and hurt example sets. multiplicity varies by task type or evaluation format (α = 0.14–0.30) rather than attention ratio. Per-example overlap saturates at 4% attention and remains flat across higher ratios, indicating that minimal attention establishes which examples each architecture affects. Yang and Wang (2026) document analogous per-item disagreement (16–66%) among frontier large language models (LLMs) despite comparable aggregate scores; our within-family design isolates backbone variation from training-regime differences. Confidence margins partially predict affected examples (area under the ROC curve [AUC] 0.70–0.74). Low cross-architecture overlap implies substantial complementarity, though routing-based exploitation remains task-dependent.

Using a controlled model zoo with three architectures, five attention ratios, and two scales, I'm decomposing the per-example effects of adding attention and finding that pairwise overlap between helped and hurt example sets is uniformly low—Jaccard similarity around 0.10, roughly twice the independence baseline across all five architectures. Our within-family design isolates backbone variation from training differences, and confidence margins partially predict which examples get affected—the area under the ROC curve sits around 0.70-0.74. The low cross-architecture overlap suggests these models have substantial complementarity, though whether routing-based approaches can exploit that depends on the specific task.

All checks pass:
- Title renders cleanly with the "≠" symbol
- Main text ends on page 8 (Conclusion completes within page 8, Limitations starts bottom of page 8 — doesn't count toward limit)
- No critical LaTeX warnings
- Abstract ~155 words (under 200 limit)

[飞书用户 周俊伟 (ou_c0792904aa02928292e8220861386365)]: Introduction 里的 contribution 有没有可能写成三点呢？这样显得更饱满一点。

另外，Limitations 后面的 code and data 那个章节，能不能放进附录里面作为一个小章节？不要放在正文和Limitation 后面了。

周俊伟提了两个修改：

1. Contributions 改成三点 — 现在是两点，他想更饱满。我需要看看能不能合理地拆出第三点。

当前 contributions:
- Item 1: Structured predictive multiplicity varying by task type, not attention ratio
- Item 2: Per-example overlap saturates at 4% attention

可以从当前内容中拆出第三点。候选：
- Confidence margins predict affected examples (AUC 0.70-0.74) + threshold asymmetry (rescue invariant, disruption varies 47%)


- Five-architecture validation 和 complementarity + routing exploration

看论文的实际发现，confidence margin prediction 是个重要的发现（§4.3 有 AUC 分析、threshold 分析），目前只在摘要和结论里提到，没有列在 contributions 里。把它加成第三点是合理的。

2. Code and Data Availability → 移到 appendix。简单操作。

现在就做这两个编辑。
```

28	Our contributions are as follows:
29	\begin{itemize}
30	    \item Architectural variation in hybrid recurrent models---controlled within a single model zoo sharing training data and hyperparameters---produces structured predictive multiplicity whose magnitude varies by task type (or evaluation format) rather than attention ratio (\S\ref{ssec:per_example}). Five-architecture validation confirms the pattern (\S\ref{ssec:robustness}; Appendix~\ref{app:extended_arch}).
31	    \item Per-example overlap saturates at the first attention level (4\%) across all four benchmarks: minimal attention establishes which examples each architecture affects, and additional attention does not homogenize these per-example sets (\S\ref{ssec:decoupling}).

52	\section*{Limitations}
53	
54	\paragraph{Single training runs.} Each configuration is a single training run; consistency across all 40 architecture--benchmark combinations (all $p < .01$) and a $3\times$ within- vs.\ cross-architecture Jaccard gap (within-seed $J$ is 2.7--4.3$\times$ higher; Appendix~\ref{app:seed_calibration}) mitigate seed confounds but cannot fully resolve them.
55	
56	\paragraph{Format confound.} The confound between task type and evaluation format cannot be fully resolved: LAMBADA is the only free-form benchmark, so its higher $\alpha$ may reflect format differences rather than cognitive demands alone.
57	
58	\paragraph{Coverage.} We examine three primary architectures (plus two extended) from one model zoo, four main benchmarks, and two scale points. Generalization to Mamba, RWKV, other hybrid families, and generation tasks remains open; all four per-example benchmarks use discriminative scoring, so multiplicity under open-ended generation is untested. Results at larger scales (e.g., 7B+) may differ, particularly as attention mechanisms become more expressive with increased capacity.
59	
60	\paragraph{Pre-training only.} All evaluations use pretrained checkpoints without fine-tuning; per-example effects may not persist after task-specific adaptation. All evaluations use greedy decoding (the lm-eval-harness default); sampling strategies may alter per-example agreement patterns.
61	
62	\section*{Code and Data Availability}
63	
64	All models are from the publicly available model zoo of \citet{wang2025hybrid}. Our analysis code and per-example evaluation outputs will be released upon publication.

    "originalFile": "\\section{Introduction}\n\nHybrid linear recurrent architectures---including GatedDeltaNet (GDN), RetNet, HGRN2, Gated Linear Attention (GLA), and DeltaNet---achieve aggregate benchmark scores within 1--2 points of each other at matched parameter budgets, yet they can differ on up to 90\\% of the individual examples they affect. This per-example divergence is invisible in aggregate metrics: architectures that score similarly reach that score by gaining and losing on different inputs, and the choice of backbone carries hidden consequences for which specific examples a deployed system handles correctly.\n\nThis tension arises in the context of a rapid architectural shift toward hybrid recurrent-attention models, which interleave attention layers within linear recurrent backbones. Jamba \\citep{lieber2024jamba}, Griffin \\citep{de2024griffin}, RWKV-6 \\citep{peng2024eagle}, and RecurrentGemma \\citep{botev2024recurrentgemma} each combine recurrence with attention using different mixing strategies. These systems now serve as production-grade alternatives to pure Transformers, and the practical question of how much attention to include is typically answered by comparing aggregate benchmark numbers. \\citet{wang2025hybrid} provide a controlled model zoo spanning three recurrent architectures, five attention ratios, and two parameter scales, which enables systematic study of how attention allocation affects these hybrid designs.\n\nPrior work on predictive multiplicity \\citep{marx2020predictive} and underspecification \\citep{damour2022underspecification,mccoy2020berts} documents this risk for seed variation within a single architecture, but whether it extends to architectural variation in hybrid recurrent models remains open. If architectures that score similarly in aggregate behave differently on individual inputs, the backbone choice carries hidden consequences for deployment reliability and ensemble construction.\n\nWe present the first controlled within-family per-example analysis of how attention affects cross-architecture agreement in hybrid recurrent models. Using the model zoo of \\citet{wang2025hybrid}, we compare three architectures---GatedDeltaNet (gated delta rules), RetNet (multi-scale exponential decay), and HGRN2 (gated state expansion)---at five attention ratios (0--25\\%) and two scales (340M, 1.3B). We evaluate all 30 configurations on 10 benchmarks spanning retrieval, comprehension, reasoning, and mixed categories. On four benchmarks (LAMBADA, $N = 5{,}153$; HellaSwag, $N = 10{,}042$; PIQA, $N = 1{,}838$; ARC-Easy, $N = 2{,}376$) we conduct per-example decompositions, classifying each example as helped, hurt, or unchanged when attention is added, and measure cross-architecture overlap via Jaccard similarity. Figure~\\ref{fig:decoupling} previews our central finding: architectures that appear equivalent by aggregate benchmarks diverge systematically at the per-example level, and this divergence is established by minimal attention.\n\n\\begin{figure*}[t]\n\\centering\n\\begin{minipage}[t]{0.56\\textwidth}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{figures/fig1_decoupling_hero.pdf}\n\\end{minipage}%\n\\hfill\n\\begin{minipage}[t]{0.42\\textwidth}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{figures/fig4_jaccard_saturation.pdf}\n\\end{minipage}\n\\caption{Per-example overlap saturates at minimal attention across benchmarks. (a,\\,b) LAMBADA: cross-architecture $\\sigma$ shows a non-significant decreasing trend at 1.3B (solid; Bonferroni-adjusted $p = .170$) but partially rebounds at 340M (dashed), while pairwise Jaccard of helped/hurt sets saturates at 4\\% attention and remains flat. (c) This saturation generalizes: on all four main benchmarks, mean pairwise $\\bar{J}$ remains flat across attention ratios (all $\\rho \\leq 0.80$, $p \\geq .333$). Shaded bands are illustrative ($n = 3$).}\n\\label{fig:decoupling}\n\\end{figure*}\n\nOur central finding is that architectural variation produces structured predictive multiplicity whose magnitude depends on task type, not attention ratio. The ambiguity $\\alpha$ \\citep{marx2020predictive} ranges from 0.14 (PIQA) to 0.30 (LAMBADA), varies $2\\times$ across task types but only 0.03 within each benchmark across attention ratios; pairwise Jaccard remains uniformly low ($\\leq 0.10$, all $p < .01$ across all ten five-architecture pairs). A supporting observation is that this per-example overlap saturates at the first attention level (4\\%) and remains flat at higher ratios---even on LAMBADA, where aggregate variance shows a non-significant decreasing trend ($\\rho = -1.0$, Bonferroni-adjusted $p = .170$; at 1.3B only), per-example Jaccard does not change (\\S\\ref{ssec:decoupling}).\n\nOur contributions are as follows:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item Architectural variation in hybrid recurrent models---controlled within a single model zoo sharing training data and hyperparameters---produces structured predictive multiplicity whose magnitude varies by task type (or evaluation format) rather than attention ratio (\\S\\ref{ssec:per_example}).

Using a controlled model zoo \\citep{wang2025hybrid} (three architectures, five attention ratios, two scales), we decompose per-example effects of adding attention and find structured predictive multiplicity \\citep{marx2020predictive}: pairwise overlap of helped and hurt example sets is uniformly low (Jaccard $\\approx 0.10$, roughly twice the independence baseline; all $p < .01$ across five architectures). This multiplicity varies by task type or evaluation format ($\\alpha = 0.14$--$0.30$) rather than attention ratio. Per-example overlap saturates at 4\\% attention and remains flat across higher ratios, indicating that minimal attention establishes which examples each architecture affects. \\citet{yang2026benchmark} document analogous per-item disagreement (16--66\\%) among frontier large language models (LLMs) despite comparable aggregate scores; our within-family design isolates backbone variation from training-regime differences. Confidence margins partially predict affected examples (area under the ROC curve [AUC] 0.70--0.74). Low cross-architecture overlap implies substantial complementarity, though routing-based exploitation remains task-dependent.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\input{sections/introduction}\n\n\\input{sections/related_work}\n\n\\input{sections/method}\n\n\\input{sections/experiments}\n\n\\input{sections/conclusion}\n\n\\section*{Limitations}\n\n\\paragraph{Single training runs.} Each configuration is a single training run; consistency across all 40 architecture--benchmark combinations (all $p < .01$) and a $3\\times$ within- vs.\\ cross-architecture Jaccard gap (within-seed $J$ is 2.7--4.3$\\times$ higher; Appendix~\\ref{app:seed_calibration}) mitigate seed confounds but cannot fully resolve them.\n\n\\paragraph{Format confound.} The confound between task type and evaluation format cannot be fully resolved: LAMBADA is the only free-form benchmark, so its higher $\\alpha$ may reflect format differences rather than cognitive demands alone.\n\n\\paragraph{Coverage.} We examine three primary architectures (plus two extended) from one model zoo, four main benchmarks, and two scale points. Generalization to Mamba, RWKV, other hybrid families, and generation tasks remains open; all four per-example benchmarks use discriminative scoring, so multiplicity under open-ended generation is untested.

There's no `ssec:confidence` label. The confidence margin analysis is in the appendix (§app:confidence_margin / §app:prediction_framework). Let me check where the confidence margins / AUC results are discussed in the experiments section. The content is likely in §4.1 (ssec:per_example) or mentioned in §4.3 (ssec:robustness), or possibly in a subsection that doesn't have a label matching "confidence".

Let me look at the experiments section around where confidence margins are discussed.

34	\subsection{Per-Example Divergence}\label{ssec:per_example}
35	
36	Do architectures converge by improving on the same examples? We compare each architecture's pure-recurrent baseline against its h3-1 hybrid on 5{,}153 LAMBADA examples, classifying each as helped, hurt, or unchanged. Although the decomposition is binary, it captures genuine separation in the continuous confidence space (Cohen's $d = 0.73$--$0.92$ between helped and hurt on LAMBADA; cross-benchmark details in Appendix~\ref{app:cm_cross}). Binarization discards confidence magnitude, so we supplement with continuous confidence margin analysis (Appendix~\ref{app:confidence_margin}) and verify that low Jaccard persists under continuous thresholds (Appendix~\ref{app:continuous_jaccard}).
37	
38	Each architecture displays a distinct profile of per-example changes (Figure~\ref{fig:per_example_bars}). GDN loses a net 153 examples (462 helped, 615 hurt), RetNet loses 69 (426/495), and HGRN2 gains 153 (548/395; full counts in Appendix~\ref{app:per_example_counts}). HGRN2 is the only architecture for which adding attention yields a net per-example benefit. Pairwise Jaccard similarity is low: mean $\bar{J} \leq 0.10$, indicating ${\sim}90$\% non-overlap. Overlap significantly exceeds the independence baseline ($J_{\text{null}} \approx 0.05$, all $z > 5.9$, $p < .0001$; Appendix~\ref{app:jaccard_permutation}), plausibly reflecting shared sensitivity to example difficulty. Normalizing by $J_{\max}$, observed overlap reaches only 6--7\% of the achievable range above chance (Appendix~\ref{app:normalized_es}), confirming that low Jaccard cannot be attributed to set-size constraints.

47	\paragraph{Confidence margin predictor.} Pure-model confidence on the target token predicts which examples will be affected (AUC 0.70--0.74, a non-parametric measure equivalent to Mann-Whitney $U$; Appendix~\ref{app:confidence_margin}): rescue thresholds are architecture-invariant (1\% spread) but disruption thresholds vary 47\%, explaining cross-architecture Jaccard divergence (Appendix~\ref{app:prediction_framework}). Calibration differences account for less than half the threshold spread (Appendix~\ref{app:calibration}). The rescue pattern generalizes across three benchmarks ($d = 0.13$--$0.60$; Appendix~\ref{app:cm_cross}); disruption is weaker on reasoning tasks (Appendix~\ref{app:boolq}). This structured disagreement constitutes predictive multiplicity \citep{marx2020predictive} under architectural variation.
48	
49	\paragraph{Confidence-based routing.} As an illustrative case study, the rescue-threshold asymmetry suggests a routing strategy: select the architecture whose pure-model confidence best predicts successful rescue. On LAMBADA, this outperforms majority vote by $+5.2$\,pp (SD $= 0.4$\,pp, 10 cross-validated splits), extracting 36\% of the oracle gap (oracle = 65.5\%; Appendix~\ref{app:complementarity}). On ARC-Easy, gains are modest ($+1.2$\,pp, SD $= 0.5$\,pp); on HellaSwag, routing provides no benefit ($-0.06$\,pp, $p = .374$); on PIQA, it is significantly negative ($-0.49$\,pp, $p = .006$). Routing works when multiplicity is high ($\alpha = 0.30$, LAMBADA) and a clear rescue-threshold signal exists, but is counterproductive when multiplicity is low ($\alpha = 0.14$, PIQA). A natural comparison---average-logits ensemble---is left to future work as it requires simultaneous inference across all architectures.
50	
51	\paragraph{Multiplicity variation.} Extending to HellaSwag ($N = 10{,}042$) and PIQA ($N = 1{,}838$) reveals that predictive multiplicity varies systematically across tasks (Table~\ref{tab:multiplicity}). The ambiguity $\alpha$ \citep{marx2020predictive} ranges from 0.14 (PIQA) through 0.15 (HellaSwag) and 0.21 (ARC-Easy; Appendix~\ref{app:arceasy}) to 0.30 (LAMBADA). Format does not drive this ordering: HellaSwag (four-way) and PIQA (two-choice) produce nearly identical $\alpha$ despite different answer-space sizes, and $\alpha$ does not correlate with task accuracy ($\rho = -0.60$, $p = .24$). This within-multiple-choice invariance suggests that per-example multiplicity is associated with the cognitive demands of the task rather than the mechanical constraints of the evaluation format, though the confound between task type and format cannot be fully resolved with the present benchmarks (Limitations). Bootstrap 95\% CIs confirm the ordering (all non-overlapping except PIQA--HellaSwag; Table~\ref{tab:arceasy_ambiguity}). Pairwise Jaccard remains uniformly low ($\bar{J} \leq 0.10$, all $p < .01$ across four benchmarks), indicating that architectures affect different examples regardless of how many are affected. Within each benchmark, $\alpha$ is stable across attention ratios (variation $< 0.03$) but differs $2\times$ across task types (or evaluation formats), confirming that multiplicity magnitude depends on task, not attention ratio \citep[cf.][]{gorbett2026crossmodel}.

The confidence margin discussion is at line 47 as a `\paragraph{Confidence margin predictor.}` within §4.1 (ssec:per_example). So the section ref should point to `\S\ref{ssec:per_example}`. Let me update the contribution to use the right ref.

Actually, looking at the structure more carefully, the confidence margin content is in §4.1 (Per-Example Divergence), which is `ssec:per_example`. The appendix has the detailed analysis (`app:confidence_margin`, `app:prediction_framework`). 


I'll change the reference from `\S\ref{ssec:confidence}` to `\S\ref{ssec:per_example}` since that's where the main discussion lives in the text.

    "originalFile": "\\section{Introduction}\n\nHybrid linear recurrent architectures---including GatedDeltaNet (GDN), RetNet, HGRN2, Gated Linear Attention (GLA), and DeltaNet---achieve aggregate benchmark scores within 1--2 points of each other at matched parameter budgets, yet they can differ on up to 90\\% of the individual examples they affect. This per-example divergence is invisible in aggregate metrics: architectures that score similarly reach that score by gaining and losing on different inputs, and the choice of backbone carries hidden consequences for which specific examples a deployed system handles correctly.\n\nThis tension arises in the context of a rapid architectural shift toward hybrid recurrent-attention models, which interleave attention layers within linear recurrent backbones. Jamba \\citep{lieber2024jamba}, Griffin \\citep{de2024griffin}, RWKV-6 \\citep{peng2024eagle}, and RecurrentGemma \\citep{botev2024recurrentgemma} each combine recurrence with attention using different mixing strategies. These systems now serve as production-grade alternatives to pure Transformers, and the practical question of how much attention to include is typically answered by comparing aggregate benchmark numbers. \\citet{wang2025hybrid} provide a controlled model zoo spanning three recurrent architectures, five attention ratios, and two parameter scales, which enables systematic study of how attention allocation affects these hybrid designs.\n\nPrior work on predictive multiplicity \\citep{marx2020predictive} and underspecification \\citep{damour2022underspecification,mccoy2020berts} documents this risk for seed variation within a single architecture, but whether it extends to architectural variation in hybrid recurrent models remains open. If architectures that score similarly in aggregate behave differently on individual inputs, the backbone choice carries hidden consequences for deployment reliability and ensemble construction.\n\nWe present the first controlled within-family per-example analysis of how attention affects cross-architecture agreement in hybrid recurrent models. Using the model zoo of \\citet{wang2025hybrid}, we compare three architectures---GatedDeltaNet (gated delta rules), RetNet (multi-scale exponential decay), and HGRN2 (gated state expansion)---at five attention ratios (0--25\\%) and two scales (340M, 1.3B). We evaluate all 30 configurations on 10 benchmarks spanning retrieval, comprehension, reasoning, and mixed categories. On four benchmarks (LAMBADA, $N = 5{,}153$; HellaSwag, $N = 10{,}042$; PIQA, $N = 1{,}838$; ARC-Easy, $N = 2{,}376$) we conduct per-example decompositions, classifying each example as helped, hurt, or unchanged when attention is added, and measure cross-architecture overlap via Jaccard similarity. Figure~\\ref{fig:decoupling} previews our central finding: architectures that appear equivalent by aggregate benchmarks diverge systematically at the per-example level, and this divergence is established by minimal attention.\n\n\\begin{figure*}[t]\n\\centering\n\\begin{minipage}[t]{0.56\\textwidth}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{figures/fig1_decoupling_hero.pdf}\n\\end{minipage}%\n\\hfill\n\\begin{minipage}[t]{0.42\\textwidth}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{figures/fig4_jaccard_saturation.pdf}\n\\end{minipage}\n\\caption{Per-example overlap saturates at minimal attention across benchmarks. (a,\\,b) LAMBADA: cross-architecture $\\sigma$ shows a non-significant decreasing trend at 1.3B (solid; Bonferroni-adjusted $p = .170$) but partially rebounds at 340M (dashed), while pairwise Jaccard of helped/hurt sets saturates at 4\\% attention and remains flat. (c) This saturation generalizes: on all four main benchmarks, mean pairwise $\\bar{J}$ remains flat across attention ratios (all $\\rho \\leq 0.80$, $p \\geq .333$). Shaded bands are illustrative ($n = 3$).}\n\\label{fig:decoupling}\n\\end{figure*}\n\nOur central finding is that architectural variation produces structured predictive multiplicity whose magnitude depends on task type, not attention ratio. The ambiguity $\\alpha$ \\citep{marx2020predictive} ranges from 0.14 (PIQA) to 0.30 (LAMBADA), varies $2\\times$ across task types but only 0.03 within each benchmark across attention ratios; pairwise Jaccard remains uniformly low ($\\leq 0.10$, all $p < .01$ across all ten five-architecture pairs). A supporting observation is that this per-example overlap saturates at the first attention level (4\\%) and remains flat at higher ratios---even on LAMBADA, where aggregate variance shows a non-significant decreasing trend ($\\rho = -1.0$, Bonferroni-adjusted $p = .170$; at 1.3B only), per-example Jaccard does not change (\\S\\ref{ssec:decoupling}).\n\nOur contributions are as follows:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item Architectural variation in hybrid recurrent models---controlled within a single model zoo sharing training data and hyperparameters---produces structured predictive multiplicity whose magnitude varies by task type (or evaluation format) rather than attention ratio (\\S\\ref{ssec:per_example}). Five-architecture validation confirms the pattern (\\S\\ref{ssec:robustness}; Appendix~\\ref{app:extended_arch}).\n    \\item Per-example overlap saturates at the first attention level (4\\%) across all four benchmarks: minimal attention establishes which examples each architecture affects, and additional attention does not homogenize these per-example sets (\\S\\ref{ssec:decoupling}).\n    \\item Pure-model confidence margins partially predict which examples attention will affect (AUC 0.70--0.74), with rescue thresholds architecture-invariant but disruption thresholds varying 47\\% across architectures---a second dimension of multiplicity beyond per-example disagreement (\\S\\ref{ssec:confidence}).\n\\end{itemize}\n",

```text
Compilation is clean - no critical warnings, no undefined refs. The 22-page total includes appendix. The "over_limit" is just because the checker counts all pages including appendix. The page limit applies to main text only (through Conclusion), and Limitations/References/Appendix are unlimited.

Let me quickly verify the main text is still within 8 pages by checking where Limitations section starts.

Looking at page 8: I can see the end of §4.3 Robustness, then §5 Conclusion, and then *Limitations starts on page 8. The main text (through Conclusion) ends on page 8. The Limitations section starts at the bottom of page 8.

Since EMNLP 2026 says Limitations don't count toward the 8-page limit, the main text is exactly 8 pages. ✅

Let me clean up and report to the user.

周俊伟在质疑第三个 contribution 是否真实有实验数据支撑。让我验证一下这些数字确实在论文的实验部分和附录中有数据支持。

第三个 contribution 的关键 claim：
1. AUC 0.70-0.74 — 需要在实验部分/附录中找到
2. Rescue thresholds architecture-invariant (1% spread) — 需要找到
3. Disruption thresholds varying 47% — 需要找到


4. 我找到了 AUC 的数据支持：experiments.tex 中明确提到 AUC 0.70-0.74，而且附录的预测 AUC 表格显示了具体的数值（rescue 任务中 GDN 0.701、RetNet 0.696、HGRN2 0.708；disruption 任务中 GDN 0.732、RetNet 0.722、HGRN2 0.743），完全符合声称的范围。

5. 关于阈值的变异性，我看到了 threshold_gap 表格的数据：rescue 阈值在三个架构中非常一致（GDN 3.32、RetNet 3.29、HGRN2 3.31，相对差异仅 1.0%），而 disruption 阈值则差异很大（GDN 0.70、RetNet 1.00、HGRN2 1.14，相对差异达 47%）。

6. 这些数字已经在论文的结论和摘要中被引用过，所以这些数据点都是经过验证的。

全部有实验数据支撑，不是编造的。数据来源：

- **AUC 0.70–0.74**：Appendix Table 10 (`tab:prediction_auc`)，三个架构的 parametric AUC — GDN 0.701/0.732, RetNet 0.696/0.722, HGRN2 0.708/0.743（rescue/disruption）
- **Rescue 阈值 1% spread**：Appendix Table 12 (`tab:threshold_gap`) — GDN 3.32, RetNet 3.29, HGRN2 3.31, relative spread 1.0%
- **Disruption 阈值 47% 变化**：同一张表 — GDN 0.70, RetNet 1.00, HGRN2 1.14, relative spread 46.7%

主文 §4.1 "Confidence margin predictor" 段落（experiments.tex:47）已有完整讨论，Conclusion 也引用了同样的数字。

周俊伟提了3个大的修改：

1. Related Work §3 太长，需要缩短
2. 视觉观感改进：
   (a) 正文图表不够多，需要增加
   (b) 配色方案需要统一和提升
3. 图表分布要均匀，每页（除第一页外）至少一个图/表在页顶

这是一个比较大的任务。让我分析一下：

**1. Related Work §3 缩短**


Related Work 分为三个部分，其中第三部分关于 Underspecification 和 Predictive Multiplicity 占了3段，确实需要压缩。

**2a. 增加正文图表**
目前正文只有两个主要图表——introduction 的 hero figure 和 method section 的方法概览图，需要在其他章节补充更多可视化内容。

我在检查实验部分的图表分布：有多个条形图、热力图和层级图，以及两个表格展示收敛性和多重性的结果。现在要梳理各页面的布局，看哪些页面缺少图表来优化整体呈现。

**2b. 配色方案**
所有图表的颜色需要统一重新设计。

**3. 图表分布均匀**
我需要调整图表和表格的位置，确保每页都有合适的视觉内容。这涉及几个关键步骤：先压缩相关工作部分，然后渲染当前PDF查看实际页面布局，最后根据情况决定是否需要重新生成图表或调整它们的位置。考虑到任务的复杂性和时间限制，我应该优先处理最关键的部分。

我先从压缩相关工作开始，然后查看当前的页面布局，再根据缺少图表的页面来规划后续的工作。对于配色方案，我需要选择一个学术级别的调色板——使用柔和、去饱和的颜色，并确保对色盲友好，比如Tableau 10或其他精心设计的方案。

对于三个架构（GDN、RetNet、HGRN2），我打算用更柔和的颜色替换当前过于饱和的配色，比如用柔和的珊瑚色、钢蓝色和鼠尾草绿来区分它们。

现在的关键是时间管理——明天就是截止日期。我需要先压缩相关工作部分，然后渲染PDF查看当前布局，接着设计最终的配色方案。最耗时的是用新颜色重新生成所有图表，以及从附录中挑选合适的图表添加到内容稀疏的页面。我先从能立即完成的任务开始：压缩相关工作和渲染PDF。

```text
1	\section{Related Work}
2	
3	\paragraph{Hybrid Recurrent Architectures.}
4	The design space for combining attention with recurrence spans layer-level interleaving \citep[Jamba;][]{lieber2024jamba}, local attention pairing \citep[Griffin, RecurrentGemma;][]{de2024griffin,botev2024recurrentgemma}, matrix-valued recurrence \citep[RWKV-6;][]{peng2024eagle}, within-head mixing \citep[Hymba;][]{dong2024hymba}, and unbounded-context hybrid SSMs \citep[Samba;][]{ren2024samba}. H3 \citep{fu2023hungry} and Hyena \citep{poli2023hyena} establish early design points in the hybrid space with gated convolutions and subquadratic operators. Mamba-2 \citep{dao2024mamba2} establishes a duality between structured state spaces and attention; Mamba-3 \citep{lahoti2026mamba3} extends the design further, while \citet{ali2025hidden} reveal implicit attention within Mamba. Comparative evaluations confirm that hybrids outperform pure Transformers and SSMs at scale \citep{waleffe2024empirical}, and that even one attention layer enables content-based routing \citep{basu2026routing}. Recent theoretical work establishes a provable expressiveness hierarchy between hybrid and pure linear attention \citep{ye2026provable}, providing formal grounding for the architectural differences we characterize at the per-example level. \citet{wang2025hybrid} provide the controlled model zoo we use, holding training conditions constant while varying architecture and attention ratio.
5	
6	\paragraph{Linear Recurrent Models.}
7	Our three recurrent backbones represent distinct gating strategies within the linear recurrence family: RetNet \citep{sun2023retnet} uses multi-scale exponential decay, HGRN2 \citep{qin2024hgrn2} applies gated state expansion, and GatedDeltaNet \citep{yang2024gateddeltanet} combines gated updates with delta rules. These descend from S4 \citep{gu2022s4} and Mamba \citep{gu2024mamba}, which introduced structured state spaces and input-dependent selection, respectively, and connect to linear attention \citep{katharopoulos2020transformers} through the state-space--attention duality of Mamba-2.
8	
9	\paragraph{Underspecification and Predictive Multiplicity.}

      "content": "\\section{Related Work}\n\n\\paragraph{Hybrid Recurrent Architectures.}\nThe design space for combining attention with recurrence spans layer-level interleaving \\citep[Jamba;][]{lieber2024jamba}, local attention pairing \\citep[Griffin, RecurrentGemma;][]{de2024griffin,botev2024recurrentgemma}, matrix-valued recurrence \\citep[RWKV-6;][]{peng2024eagle}, within-head mixing \\citep[Hymba;][]{dong2024hymba}, and unbounded-context hybrid SSMs \\citep[Samba;][]{ren2024samba}. H3 \\citep{fu2023hungry} and Hyena \\citep{poli2023hyena} establish early design points in the hybrid space with gated convolutions and subquadratic operators. Mamba-2 \\citep{dao2024mamba2} establishes a duality between structured state spaces and attention; Mamba-3 \\citep{lahoti2026mamba3} extends the design further, while \\citet{ali2025hidden} reveal implicit attention within Mamba. Comparative evaluations confirm that hybrids outperform pure Transformers and SSMs at scale \\citep{waleffe2024empirical}, and that even one attention layer enables content-based routing \\citep{basu2026routing}. Recent theoretical work establishes a provable expressiveness hierarchy between hybrid and pure linear attention \\citep{ye2026provable}, providing formal grounding for the architectural differences we characterize at the per-example level. \\citet{wang2025hybrid} provide the controlled model zoo we use, holding training conditions constant while varying architecture and attention ratio.\n\n\\paragraph{Linear Recurrent Models.}\nOur three recurrent backbones represent distinct gating strategies within the linear recurrence family: RetNet \\citep{sun2023retnet} uses multi-scale exponential decay, HGRN2 \\citep{qin2024hgrn2} applies gated state expansion, and GatedDeltaNet \\citep{yang2024gateddeltanet} combines gated updates with delta rules. These descend from S4 \\citep{gu2022s4} and Mamba \\citep{gu2024mamba}, which introduced structured state spaces and input-dependent selection, respectively, and connect to linear attention \\citep{katharopoulos2020transformers} through the state-space--attention duality of Mamba-2.\n\n\\paragraph{Underspecification and Predictive Multiplicity.}\n\\citet{damour2022underspecification} formalized underspecification: equivalent aggregate performance can mask per-prediction divergence. NLP instances include seed-dependent BERT disagreement \\citep{mccoy2020berts,sellam2022multiberts,dodge2020finetuning} and four-phase convergence in autoregressive LMs \\citep{fehlauer2025convergence}. \\citet{marx2020predictive} introduced predictive multiplicity as a complementary lens (extending prediction churn; \\citealt{milanifard2016launch}), showing that near-optimal models produce conflicting per-example predictions; extensions address probabilistic classification \\citep{watson2023predictive}, Rashomon capacity \\citep{hsu2022rashomon}, reconciliation \\citep{du2025reconciling,haghighat2026resolving}, and cross-model disagreement as a correctness signal \\citep{gorbett2026crossmodel}.

<details><summary>Logged reasoning block</summary>

Now I have a clear picture of the current layout:

**Page 1**: Title, Abstract, Introduction start — NO figure/table (expected, user exempted page 1)
**Page 2**: Introduction continued, Related Work starts — NO figure/table
**Page 3**: Figure 1 (hero, full-width top), Related Work continues, Method starts — ✅ Figure at top
**Page 4**: Figure 2 (method overview, top), Method continues — ✅ Figure at top
**Page 5**: Method continues, Experiments starts, Figure 3 (per-example bars, right column) — ✅ Figure present but NOT at top


**Page 6**: Table 1 (convergence table, top) — ✅ Table at top
**Page 7**: Table 2 (multiplicity, top), Figure 4 (task specificity) — ✅ Table and Figure
**Page 8**: Figure 5 (Jaccard heatmap, top), Figure 6 (Jaccard hierarchy), Conclusion, Limitations starts — ✅ Figures at top

So I've identified two problematic pages: Page 2 needs a figure or table added, and Page 5 needs Figure 3 moved to the top instead of staying in the right column.

For Page 2, I could move Table 2 earlier, pull something from the appendix, or create a summary table. For Page 5, I'll try using the [t] position to force Figure 3 to the top.

Beyond the layout issues, I need to compress the Related Work section by tightening paragraphs 10-12, and then figure out what visual content would work best for the sparse pages without duplicating what's already in the appendix.

The bigger challenge is the color scheme—all the matplotlib figures need to be regenerated with a unified professional palette. That's a lot of figures to coordinate: the decoupling hero figure, method overview, per-example bars, task specificity plot, Jaccard heatmaps, hierarchy diagram, and saturation curve. I'll need to get the Main Agent to handle the regeneration once I settle on the palette.

For the three architectures, I'm weighing a few options—Nature-style muted tones, Tableau's palette, or Seaborn's deep colors. Leaning toward something colorblind-friendly and polished, like a warm terra cotta for GDN and steel blue for RetNet.

For the remaining architectures, I'd add a sage green for HGRN2, then muted purple and dark gold for GLA and DeltaNet. Actually, the Dark2 colorbrewer palette might be ideal here—it's specifically designed to be colorblind-accessible while maintaining that professional academic look. The key constraints are distinguishability for all readers, moderate saturation, and consistency across figures.

Now I'm settling on a specific palette: terra cotta for GDN, steel blue for RetNet, olive green for HGRN2, muted purple for GLA, and dark gold for DeltaNet, with gray for unchanged values. Though I'm reconsidering whether to use Paul Tol's tested colorblind-safe palettes instead, since those are rigorously validated for accessibility. I've settled on the color scheme—these palettes are colorblind-safe and professional. For the figures themselves, I'm using green for helped, red for hurt, and gray for unchanged. Now I need to coordinate with the Main Agent to locate all the figure generation scripts, update their color definitions, regenerate everything, and integrate the new figures into the paper. Before diving into that, let me search for where these scripts are stored.

Given the deadline tomorrow, I should tackle the Related Work compression myself first—that's a quick win. Then I'll write clear instructions for the Main Agent to handle the figure regeneration in parallel. For the Related Work section, I'm condensing two paragraphs down to their essentials: the core concepts of underspecification and predictive multiplicity from D'Amour and Marx, plus the key NLP work on seed variation and ensemble methods.

I can cut the survey references and most of the Rashomon citations since they're tangential. The Yang & Wang benchmark is the most relevant comparison point, and I need to emphasize how our approach isolates backbone variation within a single family—that's our differentiation. I'll keep selective prediction and ensemble selection briefly since they're directly related, but trim the weight-space interpolation and other tangential methods.

For the next section, I'm compressing the underspecification and predictive multiplicity literature: the key insight is that prior work attributes divergence to initialization or the near-optimal set within one architecture, but we're showing that swapping the backbone itself—a structural change—produces divergence. That's the novel angle. Prior work attributes divergence to initialization noise within a single architecture, but I'm showing that swapping the recurrent backbone itself produces per-example multiplicity that varies by task---this architectural variation is distinct from seed-dependent disagreement studied in BERT and other models. My routing approach connects to selective prediction and ensemble selection methods, and while Yang & Wang found similar per-item disagreement among frontier LLMs, my within-family design specifically isolates backbone variation from training-regime differences.

Now I'm moving on to update the figures---I need to locate the figure generation scripts, adjust the color schemes, and regenerate them.

<details><summary>Logged reasoning block</summary>

Excellent! Now I have a complete picture. There's a centralized `palette.py` at `/home/ubuntu/.agent-ml-research-idea_gen_0509_2/projects/entrainment_gated_ft/figures/paper/palette.py`. The current palette is:
- BLUE = #4878CF
- CORAL = #D65F5F


- TEAL = #2D9B8F
- AMBER = #E8A838
- GRAY = #8C8C8C
- DARK = #2D2D2D
- LIGHT = #D5D5D5
- SLATE = #6B7B8D

The user finds this palette looks cheap and unprofessional. Looking at how the colors are actually used across the figures, BLUE is the primary color for GDN and data lines, CORAL is secondary for RetNet and negative indicators, TEAL handles tertiary elements like HGRN2, and AMBER is used for reasoning. I need to redesign this with a more sophisticated, cohesive palette that maintains these role distinctions but elevates the overall aesthetic.

The real issue is that several scripts are ignoring the central palette entirely — gen_fig3_alpha_routing.py, gen_fig3_jaccard_heatmap.py, and sample_characterization.py all define their own colors instead of pulling from palette.py. This fragmentation is making the whole figure set look inconsistent and amateurish. I should design a new palette that's professional and colorblind-safe, with muted but distinguishable tones inspired by top-tier ML publications, then enforce its use across all scripts. I'm considering established palettes like Lancet and JAMA that are commonly used in academic publishing, weighing their color combinations against the specific needs of this paper—distinguishing three architectures, using green/red for helped/hurt semantics, handling four task categories, and working across different visualization types like lines, bars, and heatmaps.

For a Nature Methods aesthetic, I'd use a steel blue for GDN, warm amber for RetNet, and sage green for HGRN2 as the primary architecture colors, then layer in muted terra cotta for hurt outcomes and warm gray for unchanged, with the task categories mapping to those same architecture hues to create visual coherence.

Now I'm realizing there's a potential conflict if HGRN2 and the helped semantic color are both green—they'd be indistinguishable in figures showing both dimensions. I should shift HGRN2 to a seafoam tone instead, keeping the architecture and semantic palettes visually distinct while maintaining that sophisticated, muted journal aesthetic.

Looking back at the existing code, I see it actually maps helped to blue and hurt to coral, which sidesteps the colorblind accessibility issue entirely. That's the right call, so I'll stick with that semantic mapping and finalize a clean palette around steel blue and muted rose tones.

Defining the color constants... I'm second-guessing the saturation levels—the current colors are too vivid for a professional look. Let me shift toward a more muted palette inspired by accessible color schemes, desaturating each color while keeping them distinct and warm-toned where appropriate.

Actually, I should just commit to something. The user wants that premium feel you see in high-end scientific publications, so I'm pulling from Tableau's professional palette—deep, rich colors with strong contrast but nothing that feels garish or oversaturated. I'm settling on this color palette—it's professional and muted with good contrast—and now I need to execute the full plan: update the palette file, regenerate all figures with the new colors, modify the figure generation scripts to use these colors, add content to page 2, and fix figure placement issues.

For the figure regeneration, I need to check whether those scripts are self-contained or require external data, but rather than getting bogged down in that complexity, I should prioritize strategically. The color palette update and figure regeneration will have the highest impact, so I'll dispatch the Main Agent to handle that while I tackle the LaTeX adjustments myself—adding a table to page 2 and tweaking figure positioning.

The challenge with page 2 is that it sits between Introduction and Related Work, which doesn't naturally call for a figure, but I could either add a summary table of model configurations or let the hero figure float up from page 3. For page 5, I can force Figure 3 to the top by adjusting its positioning directive in the source.

Moving figures around in LaTeX is risky since it could cascade and break the whole layout, so I'm going to focus on the highest-impact changes: updating the color palette, ensuring all figures use top positioning, and strategically adding a table to a sparse page. Let me get the Main Agent started on regenerating the figures while I work through the LaTeX adjustments.

Before dispatching though, I need to verify whether the Main Agent can actually run the Python scripts locally—I should check if matplotlib and Python are available and whether the data files are in place.

OK, Table 1 is a `table*` (full-width) with `[t]` positioning. Let me look at the rest of the experiments section to see all figure/table placements.

Let me also think about what to add to page 2. Page 2 has the end of Introduction (contributions list) and start of Related Work. There's no natural figure/table to put there.

Options for page 2:
1. Add a small summary table of the model zoo configurations (3 archs × 5 attn ratios × 2 scales)


2. Move Figure 1 to page 2 instead of page 3, though it's already `figure*[t]` so LaTeX controls placement
3. Pull a table from the appendix

The best approach might be adding a compact model zoo summary table in the Method section to float to page 2, but Method doesn't start until page 3-4. I could also try an inline table in the Introduction showing the three architectures and their mechanisms, though that feels awkward. Let me reconsider the user's actual requirement here.

The user wants every page except the first to have at least one figure or table. So page 2 definitely needs something. The most natural solution would be converting the contributions in the Introduction from a bullet list into a small table, though that's unconventional. Moving Table 1 from page 6 earlier could work but might cascade issues throughout the layout.

The cleanest fix is adding a small "Model Zoo Summary" table early on that shows the key architectures with their mechanisms and specifications—something that belongs naturally in the Method section and could float to page 4 or 5, pushing other content forward to fill page 2.

But I'm realizing page 3 already has the hero figure and page 4 has the method overview, so those are covered. The real problem is page 2 specifically, which only contains the tail end of the Introduction and the start of Related Work—neither section typically has visuals. I could try forcing Figure 1 to page 2 with stricter positioning commands, but putting a full-width figure there alongside intro text feels awkward.

Actually, the cleaner approach might be to accept that one text-heavy page is fine and instead focus on adding a useful summary table to the Method section—either a Model Zoo comparison showing architectures and parameters, or a Benchmark summary listing all 10 tasks with their categories and sizes. Either would add real value and land naturally on pages 4 or 5.

For page 2, I could move the Method overview figure from the Method section up to the introduction, where it would sit near the contributions discussion and provide visual support for the conceptual explanation already there.

The challenge is that LaTeX placement depends on where the figure is defined in the source—if it's after the Method heading, it can't float backward to page 2. So my practical strategy is to add a small table to the Method section for visual variety on pages 4-5, and try positioning Figure 3 at the top of page 5 through placement hints. For page 2 itself, having it be text-heavy with Introduction and Related Work is actually standard for EMNLP papers, so that's acceptable. Let me check how the text flows now after the compression I just did.

Since the Main Agent is regenerating figures, the layout will shift anyway, so I should focus on the conceptual plan rather than making incremental tweaks. I'm thinking about pulling some appendix tables into the main text—the attention ratio table for section 4.1, the within-architecture Jaccard summary for section 4.2, and ideally a figure for the confidence margin analysis to support the third contribution, which currently lacks visual support in the main text.

The Related Work compression freed up about half a page, which gives me room to add one new figure or table without exceeding the 8-page limit. My next steps are to integrate that appendix content strategically and fix the figure placement issues, then compile to verify the layout works.

36	Do architectures converge by improving on the same examples? We compare each architecture's pure-recurrent baseline against its h3-1 hybrid on 5{,}153 LAMBADA examples, classifying each as helped, hurt, or unchanged. Although the decomposition is binary, it captures genuine separation in the continuous confidence space (Cohen's $d = 0.73$--$0.92$ between helped and hurt on LAMBADA; cross-benchmark details in Appendix~\ref{app:cm_cross}). Binarization discards confidence magnitude, so we supplement with continuous confidence margin analysis (Appendix~\ref{app:confidence_margin}) and verify that low Jaccard persists under continuous thresholds (Appendix~\ref{app:continuous_jaccard}).
37	
38	Each architecture displays a distinct profile of per-example changes (Figure~\ref{fig:per_example_bars}). GDN loses a net 153 examples (462 helped, 615 hurt), RetNet loses 69 (426/495), and HGRN2 gains 153 (548/395; full counts in Appendix~\ref{app:per_example_counts}). HGRN2 is the only architecture for which adding attention yields a net per-example benefit. Pairwise Jaccard similarity is low: mean $\bar{J} \leq 0.10$, indicating ${\sim}90$\% non-overlap. Overlap significantly exceeds the independence baseline ($J_{\text{null}} \approx 0.05$, all $z > 5.9$, $p < .0001$; Appendix~\ref{app:jaccard_permutation}), plausibly reflecting shared sensitivity to example difficulty. Normalizing by $J_{\max}$, observed overlap reaches only 6--7\% of the achievable range above chance (Appendix~\ref{app:normalized_es}), confirming that low Jaccard cannot be attributed to set-size constraints.

43	\caption{Per-example effects of adding attention (pure $\to$ h3-1) on LAMBADA at 1.3B scale. Helped: correct only in the hybrid; hurt: correct only in the pure model. HGRN2 is the only architecture with a net positive effect. Despite comparable magnitudes, these sets overlap minimally across architectures ($\bar{J} \leq 0.10$, all $p < .0001$).}
44	\label{fig:per_example_bars}
45	\end{figure}
46	
47	\paragraph{Confidence margin predictor.} Pure-model confidence on the target token predicts which examples will be affected (AUC 0.70--0.74, a non-parametric measure equivalent to Mann-Whitney $U$; Appendix~\ref{app:confidence_margin}): rescue thresholds are architecture-invariant (1\% spread) but disruption thresholds vary 47\%, explaining cross-architecture Jaccard divergence (Appendix~\ref{app:prediction_framework}). Calibration differences account for less than half the threshold spread (Appendix~\ref{app:calibration}). The rescue pattern generalizes across three benchmarks ($d = 0.13$--$0.60$; Appendix~\ref{app:cm_cross}); disruption is weaker on reasoning tasks (Appendix~\ref{app:boolq}). This structured disagreement constitutes predictive multiplicity \citep{marx2020predictive} under architectural variation.
48	
49	\paragraph{Confidence-based routing.} As an illustrative case study, the rescue-threshold asymmetry suggests a routing strategy: select the architecture whose pure-model confidence best predicts successful rescue. On LAMBADA, this outperforms majority vote by $+5.2$\,pp (SD $= 0.4$\,pp, 10 cross-validated splits), extracting 36\% of the oracle gap (oracle = 65.5\%; Appendix~\ref{app:complementarity}). On ARC-Easy, gains are modest ($+1.2$\,pp, SD $= 0.5$\,pp); on HellaSwag, routing provides no benefit ($-0.06$\,pp, $p = .374$); on PIQA, it is significantly negative ($-0.49$\,pp, $p = .006$). Routing works when multiplicity is high ($\alpha = 0.30$, LAMBADA) and a clear rescue-threshold signal exists, but is counterproductive when multiplicity is low ($\alpha = 0.14$, PIQA). A natural comparison---average-logits ensemble---is left to future work as it requires simultaneous inference across all architectures.
50	
51	\paragraph{Multiplicity variation.} Extending to HellaSwag ($N = 10{,}042$) and PIQA ($N = 1{,}838$) reveals that predictive multiplicity varies systematically across tasks (Table~\ref{tab:multiplicity}). The ambiguity $\alpha$ \citep{marx2020predictive} ranges from 0.14 (PIQA) through 0.15 (HellaSwag) and 0.21 (ARC-Easy; Appendix~\ref{app:arceasy}) to 0.30 (LAMBADA). Format does not drive this ordering: HellaSwag (four-way) and PIQA (two-choice) produce nearly identical $\alpha$ despite different answer-space sizes, and $\alpha$ does not correlate with task accuracy ($\rho = -0.60$, $p = .24$). This within-multiple-choice invariance suggests that per-example multiplicity is associated with the cognitive demands of the task rather than the mechanical constraints of the evaluation format, though the confound between task type and format cannot be fully resolved with the present benchmarks (Limitations). Bootstrap 95\% CIs confirm the ordering (all non-overlapping except PIQA--HellaSwag; Table~\ref{tab:arceasy_ambiguity}). Pairwise Jaccard remains uniformly low ($\bar{J} \leq 0.10$, all $p < .01$ across four benchmarks), indicating that architectures affect different examples regardless of how many are affected. Within each benchmark, $\alpha$ is stable across attention ratios (variation $< 0.03$) but differs $2\times$ across task types (or evaluation formats), confirming that multiplicity magnitude depends on task, not attention ratio \citep[cf.][]{gorbett2026crossmodel}.

72	\subsection{Per-Example Overlap Saturates at Minimal Attention}\label{ssec:decoupling}
73	
74	Does adding more attention change \emph{which} examples each architecture affects? Pairwise Jaccard saturates at the first attention level (4\%; $\bar{J} \approx 0.095$) and remains flat across all higher ratios (Figure~\ref{fig:decoupling}b), indicating that minimal attention suffices to establish the full per-example divergence pattern. As background, LAMBADA's aggregate cross-architecture $\sigma$ shows a non-significant decreasing trend ($\rho = -1.0$, Bonferroni-adjusted $p = .170$; excluding GDN: $\rho = -0.7$, $p = .233$; MMLU reverses to $\rho = +0.6$ when excluding GDN; observed at 1.3B, absent at 340M; Table~\ref{tab:convergence}, Figure~\ref{fig:task_specificity}). No other benchmark shows a comparable aggregate pattern ($n = 5$; negligible power for $|\rho| < 1.0$).

LAMBADA ($\rho = -1.0$; BCa 95\% CI $[-1.0,\,-0.7]$, heuristic) is the only benchmark with a negative correlation whose confidence interval excludes zero. Benchmarks are grouped by task category. Bootstrap CI is heuristic given $n = 3$ architectures.}

87	\label{fig:jaccard_heatmap_5arch}
88	\end{figure*}
89	
90	Each architecture's per-example response to attention is largely idiosyncratic. The observed $\bar{J}$ reaches only 6--7\% of the achievable range above chance ($J_{\max} \approx 0.78$--$0.92$), ruling out ceiling constraints (\S\ref{ssec:per_example}). Readers can verify $\rho$ directly from Table~\ref{tab:convergence}; with $n = 3$ architectures, all bootstrap CIs are heuristic indicators of direction rather than precise coverage.
91	
92	This saturation generalizes beyond LAMBADA (Figure~\ref{fig:decoupling}c): on all four main benchmarks, mean pairwise Jaccard shows no significant trend with attention ratio (all $\rho \leq 0.80$, $p \geq 0.333$), with values uniformly between 0.08 and 0.11.
93	
94	Heuristic bootstrap 95\% CIs ($n = 3$; \S\ref{ssec:statistical_methods}) show non-overlapping $\sigma$ between pure and h3-1 but completely overlapping Jaccard across all hybrid ratios (\S\ref{ssec:statistical_methods}). Figure~\ref{fig:jaccard_hierarchy} shows a three-tier Jaccard hierarchy: independence baseline (${\sim}0.05$), cross-architecture (${\sim}0.10$, $2\times$ baseline), and within-architecture (${\sim}0.33$, $3\times$ cross-architecture; Appendix~\ref{app:within_arch_stability}). Pythia 70M seed calibration yields a comparable within-seed level ($J = 0.27$--$0.39$; Appendix~\ref{app:seed_calibration}), consistent with architecture-driven divergence, though matched multi-seed experiments would be needed for definitive evidence.
95

97	\centering
98	\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figures/fig_jaccard_hierarchy.pdf}
99	\caption{Jaccard hierarchy on LAMBADA (1.3B). Cross-architecture overlap ($\bar{J} \approx 0.09$) is $2\times$ the independence baseline but only one-third of within-architecture overlap ($\bar{J} \approx 0.33$). Pythia 70M within-seed Jaccard (different scale) falls at a comparable level. Error bars show the helped--hurt range.}
100	\label{fig:jaccard_hierarchy}
101	\end{figure}
102	
103	An alternative interpretation of the saturation is that adding even minimal attention causes all architectures to rapidly adopt Transformer-like behavior, rather than locking in architecture-specific fingerprints. Appendix~\ref{app:transformer_entrainment} shows that h3-1 correct sets indeed converge toward the Transformer baseline, consistent with this account. Under the fingerprint view, each recurrent backbone imposes a characteristic inductive bias that determines which examples attention can rescue; under the convergence view, attention overrides backbone differences and steers all architectures toward a shared solution, with residual per-example divergence arising from incomplete convergence. Disentangling these accounts requires ablation of the attention mechanism itself---for example, replacing learned attention weights with random projections---which we leave to future work. Attention weight analysis (Appendix~\ref{app:attention_patterns}) shows GDN and RetNet produce nearly identical attention distributions (cosine 0.995) yet differ in per-example effects, suggesting these originate in the recurrent layers. The four-benchmark variation (Table~\ref{tab:multiplicity}) is consistent with independence: LAMBADA ($\alpha = 0.30$) is the only benchmark showing a variance-reduction trend despite having the highest multiplicity, while PIQA ($\alpha = 0.14$) and HellaSwag ($\alpha = 0.15$) show no variance reduction with the lowest multiplicity.
104	
105	Cross-scale analysis reveals a clear dissociation: per-example Jaccard is consistent across both scales ($\bar{J} = 0.08$--$0.10$ at 340M and 1.3B), whereas the aggregate variance trend is observed only at 1.3B on LAMBADA ($\rho = -0.50$, $p = .45$ at 340M). Ambiguity $\alpha$ is systematically higher at 340M ($\Delta \leq 8$\,pp), suggesting that the \emph{pattern} of per-example multiplicity is stable across scales while its magnitude co-varies with model capacity (Appendix~\ref{app:scale_per_example}--\ref{app:cross_scale}).

107	\subsection{Robustness}\label{ssec:robustness}
108	
109	Removing GDN weakens the LAMBADA variance reduction ($\rho = -0.7$, $p = .233$) and reverses MMLU's ($\rho = +0.6$), both driven by GDN's 16-head configuration (vs.\ 32 in others; Appendix~\ref{app:gdn_confound}). The RetNet--HGRN2 pair preserves the independence pattern ($\sigma \leq 0.008$, $J = 0.086$--$0.108$). The aggregate variance pattern therefore depends on GDN inclusion; the per-example saturation result does not. Five-architecture validation at 340M (adding GLA and DeltaNet) confirms $J \leq 0.14$ across all ten pairwise comparisons and four benchmarks (all $p < .01$; Figure~\ref{fig:jaccard_heatmap_5arch}; Appendix~\ref{app:extended_arch}), extending the per-example divergence finding to architectures not used in the primary analysis. Full sensitivity analyses appear in Appendix~\ref{app:sensitivity}; Transformer baseline comparison in Appendix~\ref{app:transformer_entrainment}.

      "content": "\nDo architectures converge by improving on the same examples? We compare each architecture's pure-recurrent baseline against its h3-1 hybrid on 5{,}153 LAMBADA examples, classifying each as helped, hurt, or unchanged. Although the decomposition is binary, it captures genuine separation in the continuous confidence space (Cohen's $d = 0.73$--$0.92$ between helped and hurt on LAMBADA; cross-benchmark details in Appendix~\\ref{app:cm_cross}). Binarization discards confidence magnitude, so we supplement with continuous confidence margin analysis (Appendix~\\ref{app:confidence_margin}) and verify that low Jaccard persists under continuous thresholds (Appendix~\\ref{app:continuous_jaccard}).\n\nEach architecture displays a distinct profile of per-example changes (Figure~\\ref{fig:per_example_bars}). GDN loses a net 153 examples (462 helped, 615 hurt), RetNet loses 69 (426/495), and HGRN2 gains 153 (548/395; full counts in Appendix~\\ref{app:per_example_counts}). HGRN2 is the only architecture for which adding attention yields a net per-example benefit. Pairwise Jaccard similarity is low: mean $\\bar{J} \\leq 0.10$, indicating ${\\sim}90$\\% non-overlap. Overlap significantly exceeds the independence baseline ($J_{\\text{null}} \\approx 0.05$, all $z > 5.9$, $p < .0001$; Appendix~\\ref{app:jaccard_permutation}), plausibly reflecting shared sensitivity to example difficulty. Normalizing by $J_{\\max}$, observed overlap reaches only 6--7\\% of the achievable range above chance (Appendix~\\ref{app:normalized_es}), confirming that low Jaccard cannot be attributed to set-size constraints.\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{figures/fig_per_example_bars.pdf}\n\\caption{Per-example effects of adding attention (pure $\\to$ h3-1) on LAMBADA at 1.3B scale. Helped: correct only in the hybrid; hurt: correct only in the pure model. HGRN2 is the only architecture with a net positive effect. Despite comparable magnitudes, these sets overlap minimally across architectures ($\\bar{J} \\leq 0.10$, all $p < .0001$).}\n\\label{fig:per_example_bars}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\paragraph{Confidence margin predictor.} Pure-model confidence on the target token predicts which examples will be affected (AUC 0.70--0.74, a non-parametric measure equivalent to Mann-Whitney $U$; Appendix~\\ref{app:confidence_margin}): rescue thresholds are architecture-invariant (1\\% spread) but disruption thresholds vary 47\\%, explaining cross-architecture Jaccard divergence (Appendix~\\ref{app:prediction_framework}). Calibration differences account for less than half the threshold spread (Appendix~\\ref{app:calibration}). The rescue pattern generalizes across three benchmarks ($d = 0.13$--$0.60$; Appendix~\\ref{app:cm_cross}); disruption is weaker on reasoning tasks (Appendix~\\ref{app:boolq}). This structured disagreement constitutes predictive multiplicity \\citep{marx2020predictive} under architectural variation.\n\n\\paragraph{Confidence-based routing.} As an illustrative case study, the rescue-threshold asymmetry suggests a routing strategy: select the architecture whose pure-model confidence best predicts successful rescue. On LAMBADA, this outperforms majority vote by $+5.2$\\,pp (SD $= 0.4$\\,pp, 10 cross-validated splits), extracting 36\\% of the oracle gap (oracle = 65.5\\%; Appendix~\\ref{app:complementarity}). On ARC-Easy, gains are modest ($+1.2$\\,pp, SD $= 0.5$\\,pp); on HellaSwag, routing provides no benefit ($-0.06$\\,pp, $p = .374$); on PIQA, it is significantly negative ($-0.49$\\,pp, $p = .006$). Routing works when multiplicity is high ($\\alpha = 0.30$, LAMBADA) and a clear rescue-threshold signal exists, but is counterproductive when multiplicity is low ($\\alpha = 0.14$, PIQA). A natural comparison---average-logits ensemble---is left to future work as it requires simultaneous inference across all architectures.\n\n\\paragraph{Multiplicity variation.} Extending to HellaSwag ($N = 10{,}042$) and PIQA ($N = 1{,}838$) reveals that predictive multiplicity varies systematically across tasks (Table~\\ref{tab:multiplicity}). The ambiguity $\\alpha$ \\citep{marx2020predictive} ranges from 0.14 (PIQA) through 0.15 (HellaSwag) and 0.21 (ARC-Easy; Appendix~\\ref{app:arceasy}) to 0.30 (LAMBADA). Format does not drive this ordering: HellaSwag (four-way) and PIQA (two-choice) produce nearly identical $\\alpha$ despite different answer-space sizes, and $\\alpha$ does not correlate with task accuracy ($\\rho = -0.60$, $p = .24$). This within-multiple-choice invariance suggests that per-example multiplicity is associated with the cognitive demands of the task rather than the mechanical constraints of the evaluation format, though the confound between task type and format cannot be fully resolved with the present benchmarks (Limitations). Bootstrap 95\\% CIs confirm the ordering (all non-overlapping except PIQA--HellaSwag; Table~\\ref{tab:arceasy_ambiguity}). Pairwise Jaccard remains uniformly low ($\\bar{J} \\leq 0.10$, all $p < .01$ across four benchmarks), indicating that architectures affect different examples regardless of how many are affected. Within each benchmark, $\\alpha$ is stable across attention ratios (variation $< 0.03$) but differs $2\\times$ across task types (or evaluation formats), confirming that multiplicity magnitude depends on task, not attention ratio \\citep[cf.][]{gorbett2026crossmodel}.\n\n\\begin{table}[t]\n\\centering\n\\small\n\\caption{Predictive multiplicity at 1.3B. $\\alpha$: ambiguity at h3-1 \\citep{marx2020predictive}. $\\bar{J}$: mean pairwise Jaccard of helped~(h) and hurt~(u) sets, averaged across four hybrid attention ratios and three architecture pairs. $\\rho_\\alpha$: Spearman $\\rho$ between attention ratio and $\\alpha$.

Pairwise Jaccard saturates at the first attention level (4\\%; $\\bar{J} \\approx 0.095$) and remains flat across all higher ratios (Figure~\\ref{fig:decoupling}b), indicating that minimal attention suffices to establish the full per-example divergence pattern. As background, LAMBADA's aggregate cross-architecture $\\sigma$ shows a non-significant decreasing trend ($\\rho = -1.0$, Bonferroni-adjusted $p = .170$; excluding GDN: $\\rho = -0.7$, $p = .233$; MMLU reverses to $\\rho = +0.6$ when excluding GDN; observed at 1.3B, absent at 340M; Table~\\ref{tab:convergence}, Figure~\\ref{fig:task_specificity}). No other benchmark shows a comparable aggregate pattern ($n = 5$; negligible power for $|\\rho| < 1.0$).\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{figures/fig2_task_specificity.pdf}\n\\caption{Spearman $\\rho$ between attention ratio and cross-architecture $\\sigma$ for each benchmark at 1.3B scale. LAMBADA ($\\rho = -1.0$; BCa 95\\% CI $[-1.0,\\,-0.7]$, heuristic) is the only benchmark with a negative correlation whose confidence interval excludes zero. Benchmarks are grouped by task category. Bootstrap CI is heuristic given $n = 3$ architectures.}\n\\label{fig:task_specificity}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\begin{figure*}[t]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{figures/jaccard_heatmap_5arch.pdf}\n\\caption{Pairwise Jaccard heatmap across five architectures (340M, h3-1), where helped (hurt) examples are those correct only with (without) attention.

HellaSwag and PIQA results in Appendix~\\ref{app:extended_arch}.}\n\\label{fig:jaccard_heatmap_5arch}\n\\end{figure*}\n\nEach architecture's per-example response to attention is largely idiosyncratic. The observed $\\bar{J}$ reaches only 6--7\\% of the achievable range above chance ($J_{\\max} \\approx 0.78$--$0.92$), ruling out ceiling constraints (\\S\\ref{ssec:per_example}). Readers can verify $\\rho$ directly from Table~\\ref{tab:convergence}; with $n = 3$ architectures, all bootstrap CIs are heuristic indicators of direction rather than precise coverage.\n\nThis saturation generalizes beyond LAMBADA (Figure~\\ref{fig:decoupling}c): on all four main benchmarks, mean pairwise Jaccard shows no significant trend with attention ratio (all $\\rho \\leq 0.80$, $p \\geq 0.333$), with values uniformly between 0.08 and 0.11.\n\nHeuristic bootstrap 95\\% CIs ($n = 3$; \\S\\ref{ssec:statistical_methods}) show non-overlapping $\\sigma$ between pure and h3-1 but completely overlapping Jaccard across all hybrid ratios (\\S\\ref{ssec:statistical_methods}). Figure~\\ref{fig:jaccard_hierarchy} shows a three-tier Jaccard hierarchy: independence baseline (${\\sim}0.05$), cross-architecture (${\\sim}0.10$, $2\\times$ baseline), and within-architecture (${\\sim}0.33$, $3\\times$ cross-architecture; Appendix~\\ref{app:within_arch_stability}). Pythia 70M seed calibration yields a comparable within-seed level ($J = 0.27$--$0.39$; Appendix~\\ref{app:seed_calibration}), consistent with architecture-driven divergence, though matched multi-seed experiments would be needed for definitive evidence.\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{figures/fig_jaccard_hierarchy.pdf}\n\\caption{Jaccard hierarchy on LAMBADA (1.3B). Cross-architecture overlap ($\\bar{J} \\approx 0.09$) is $2\\times$ the independence baseline but only one-third of within-architecture overlap ($\\bar{J} \\approx 0.33$). Pythia 70M within-seed Jaccard (different scale) falls at a comparable level. Error bars show the helped--hurt range.}\n\\label{fig:jaccard_hierarchy}\n\\end{figure}\n\nAn alternative interpretation of the saturation is that adding even minimal attention causes all architectures to rapidly adopt Transformer-like behavior, rather than locking in architecture-specific fingerprints. Appendix~\\ref{app:transformer_entrainment} shows that h3-1 correct sets indeed converge toward the Transformer baseline, consistent with this account. Under the fingerprint view, each recurrent backbone imposes a characteristic inductive bias that determines which examples attention can rescue; under the convergence view, attention overrides backbone differences and steers all architectures toward a shared solution, with residual per-example divergence arising from incomplete convergence. Disentangling these accounts requires ablation of the attention mechanism itself---for example, replacing learned attention weights with random projections---which we leave to future work. Attention weight analysis (Appendix~\\ref{app:attention_patterns}) shows GDN and RetNet produce nearly identical attention distributions (cosine 0.995) yet differ in per-example effects, suggesting these originate in the recurrent layers.

Now I have a full picture of the experiments section layout. Let me think about what to add:

Current figures/tables in main text:
1. Figure 1: Hero (intro, p3, figure*)
2. Figure 2: Method overview (method, p4)
3. Table 1: Convergence (experiments start, p6, table*)
4. Figure 3: Per-example bars (§4.1, p5)
5. Figure 4: Task specificity (§4.2, p7)


6. Figure 5: Jaccard heatmap 5-arch (§4.2, p7-8, figure*)
7. Table 2: Multiplicity (§4.1, p7)
8. Figure 6: Jaccard hierarchy (§4.2, p8)

For page 2, since I've compressed the Related Work section, there's now space available. I could either float one of the existing figures there or introduce a new compact element. The real question is which high-value figure or table would strengthen the main narrative most effectively.

The confidence margin prediction table from the appendix stands out as the strongest candidate—it directly validates the third contribution and would be much more impactful in the main text than buried in the appendix. I'm looking at the AUC values and threshold spreads to create a compact table that reinforces this claim.

Given the 8-page constraint and the space I've freed up from compressing Related Work, I can fit this table into §4.1 right after the confidence margin predictor discussion. I should also reconsider the positioning of existing figures to optimize the layout.

I'm noticing that the alpha routing figure—which visualizes per-example ambiguity and confidence-based routing gains—isn't currently referenced in the experiments section, even though it would directly support both my first and third contributions. Let me track down whether it's actually being used or if I should incorporate it into the main text.

```text
The fig3_alpha_routing figure exists in the figure generation scripts but isn't used in the paper! This is a perfect candidate to add to the main text. It shows (a) ambiguity α across benchmarks and (b) routing gains — both key results that are currently only described in text.

Let me check what it looks like.

There's an unused figure `fig3_alpha_routing` that shows ambiguity α and routing gains — perfect for adding visual density. Let me check what's available.

Good — the figure exists but isn't referenced in the paper. Let me add it to the experiments section along with a compact confidence margin table to support the 3rd contribution. This will add visual elements to the currently text-heavy pages.

This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The summary below covers the earlier portion of the conversation.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   - **曹晓玉 (primary user)**: Improve paper quality for EMNLP 2026 ARR submission (DDL 2026-05-25, tomorrow). Previously requested PaperBanana figure redraws and 6 specific text modifications.
   - **周俊伟 (co-author)**: Multiple rounds of feedback:
     - Asked for PaperBanana Figure 2 — rejected all 7 versions as "ugly and cheap, lacking premium quality"
     - Requested contributions expanded to 3 points, Code/Data Availability moved to appendix
     - Questioned whether 3rd contribution was fabricated (verified from data)
     - **Most recent request (3 major items)**: (1) Shorten Related Work §3, (2a) Add more figures/tables to main text for visual density, (2b) Redesign unified professional color scheme for ALL figures, (3) Every page (except p1) should have at least one figure/table at top
   - I am the Research Director (PI) managing Main Agent, Paper Agent, and Reviewer roles

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - EMNLP 2026 via ARR: 8-page main text limit, unlimited appendix, abstract ≤200 words, Limitations don't count toward page limit
   - Paper: "Aggregate Equivalence ≠ Behavioral Equivalence: Per-Example Multiplicity in Hybrid Linear Recurrent Models"
   - Controlled model zoo from Wang et al. (2025): 3 architectures × 5 attention ratios × 2 scales
   - Key metrics: Jaccard similarity (~0.10), ambiguity α (0.14–0.30), AUC 0.70-0.74, disruption threshold spread 47%
   - PaperBanana: Gemini-powered conceptual figure tool, uses `--vlm-model gemini-2.5-pro`
   - Centralized figure palette at `figures/paper/palette.py` controls all matplotlib figure colors
   - 8 figure generation scripts in `figures/paper/gen_*.py`

3. Files and Code Sections:

   - **`docs/paper/main.tex`** (multiple edits)
     - Title changed: `\title{Aggregate Equivalence $\neq$ Behavioral Equivalence: Per-Example Multiplicity in Hybrid Linear Recurrent Models}`
     - Abstract last sentence: `"Low cross-architecture overlap implies substantial complementarity, though routing-based exploitation remains task-dependent."`
     - Limitations "Single training runs" compressed: `"Each configuration is a single training run; consistency across all 40 architecture--benchmark combinations (all $p < .01$) and a $3\times$ within- vs.\ cross-architecture Jaccard gap (within-seed $J$ is 2.7--4.3$\times$ higher; Appendix~\ref{app:seed_calibration}) mitigate seed confounds but cannot fully resolve them."`
     - Code and Data Availability section REMOVED from main text (moved to appendix)

   - **`docs/paper/sections/introduction.tex`** (multiple edits)
     - Paragraph 1 simplified: removed "adding attention to three controlled linear recurrent backbones yields helped and hurt sets with at most 10\% pairwise overlap..." and "Across all ten pairwise comparisons among five architectures, overlap in per-example effects remains below 14\% (all $p < .01$)..."
     - Paragraph 4 ending: changed to "architectures that appear equivalent by aggregate benchmarks diverge systematically at the per-example level, and this divergence is established by minimal attention."
     - Paragraph 5: restructured from "Our analysis yields two findings. First... Second..." to "Our central finding is that architectural variation produces structured predictive multiplicity whose magnitude depends on task type, not attention ratio... A supporting observation is that this per-example overlap saturates at the first attention level (4%)..."
     - Contributions expanded to 3 items — added: `\item Pure-model confidence margins partially predict which examples attention will affect (AUC 0.70--0.74), with rescue thresholds architecture-invariant but disruption thresholds varying 47\% across architectures---a second dimension of multiplicity beyond per-example disagreement (\S\ref{ssec:per_example}; Appendix~\ref{app:prediction_framework}).`

   - **`docs/paper/sections/related_work.tex`** (compressed §3)
     - Underspecification and Predictive Multiplicity paragraph merged from 2 paragraphs to 1
     - Removed: prediction churn (Milanifard), surveys (Black, Ganesh), fairness (Cooper), Swayamdipta training dynamics, 6 Rashomon refs (Fisher, Jain, Fort, Kuncheva, Brown, Semenova→kept 2)
     - Kept: D'Amour, Marx, McCoy, Sellam, Watson, Hsu, Du, Haghighat, Fisher, Semenova, Wortsman, Geifman, Caruana, Yang2026

   - **`docs/paper/sections/appendix.tex`** (added section)
     - Added `\section{Code and Data Availability}\label{app:code_data}` before Use of AI Assistants section
     - Content: "All models are from the publicly available model zoo of \citet{wang2025hybrid}. Our analysis code and per-example evaluation outputs will be released upon publication."

   - **`figures/paper/palette.py`** (color scheme updated)
     - Old: BLUE=#4878CF, CORAL=#D65F5F, TEAL=#2D9B8F, AMBER=#E8A838, GRAY=#8C8C8C, DARK=#2D2D2D, LIGHT=#D5D5D5, SLATE=#6B7B8D
     - New: BLUE=#4E79A7, CORAL=#C56C6C, TEAL=#59A572, AMBER=#E49444, GRAY=#999999, DARK=#333333, LIGHT=#E5E5E5, SLATE=#708090, PURPLE=#B07AA1, GOLD=#E0C960
     - RCPARAMS unchanged (Helvetica Neue, 7.5pt, 300 DPI, etc.)

   - **Figure generation scripts** (identified, not yet modified):
     - `figures/paper/gen_fig1.py` → fig1_decoupling_hero.pdf
     - `figures/paper/gen_fig2.py` → fig2_task_specificity.pdf
     - `figures/paper/gen_fig_method_overview.py` → fig_method_overview.pdf
     - `figures/paper/gen_fig3_alpha_routing.py` → fig3_alpha_routing.pdf (NOT in paper yet!)
     - `figures/paper/gen_fig3_jaccard_heatmap.py` → jaccard_heatmap_5arch.pdf
     - `figures/paper/gen_fig4_jaccard_saturation.py` → fig4_jaccard_saturation.pdf
     - `figures/paper/gen_fig5_per_example_bars.py` → fig_per_example_bars.pdf
     - `figures/paper/gen_fig_jaccard_hierarchy.py` → fig_jaccard_hierarchy.pdf
     - 3 scripts DON'T use palette.py: gen_fig3_alpha_routing.py (#4DBBD5, #E64B35, #3C5488), gen_fig3_jaccard_heatmap.py (custom colormap), gen_fig_method_overview.py (custom panel colors)

   - **PaperBanana outputs**: 7 versions in `docs/paper/figures/`:
     - fig2_banana_v1.png through v7 (v2, v4, v5_separate_circles, v6_dot_matrix, v7_table_grid)
     - All rejected by 周俊伟 as ugly
     - v8/v9 "premium" versions dispatched but Agent hasn't reported back yet; PaperBanana figure task is still unresolved

4. Errors and Fixes:
   - **PaperBanana silent failures**: Agent generated intent files (v2-v5 in /tmp/) but failed to produce actual PNGs. Fixed by re-dispatching with explicit step-by-step commands, correct `--vlm-model gemini-2.5-pro`, and "禁止静默失败" requirement.
   - **Section ref error**: Added `\S\ref{ssec:confidence}` for 3rd contribution but no such label existed. Fixed by changing to `\S\ref{ssec:per_example}; Appendix~\ref{app:prediction_framework}` (confidence margin content is in §4.1).
   - **\cite check**: User requested \cite→\citep/\citet conversion. Grep found no matches — already all using \citep/\citet. No fix needed.

5. Problem Solving:
   - **Central finding hierarchy**: Resolved by restructuring intro paragraphs 4-5 from parallel "two findings" to hierarchical "central finding + supporting observation"
   - **3rd contribution validity**: Verified all numbers (AUC 0.70-0.74, rescue 1% spread, disruption 47%) against Appendix Tables 10 and 12 (prediction_auc, threshold_gap)
   - **Page layout analysis**: Mapped all 8 pages — identified pages 2 and 5 as lacking figures/tables at top. Page 2 has intro+related work text only; page 5 has Figure 3 but not at top position.
   - **Color scheme upgrade**: Identified that current palette (#4878CF etc.) looks "cheap"; designed new muted professional palette inspired by Nature/Science aesthetics

6. All User Messages:
   - "Continue from where you left off." (multiple times)
   - [Agent 回复]: PaperBanana Figure 2 — 7 versions produced, v5 recommended (separate circles), v6 alternative (dot matrix)
   - [飞书用户 周俊伟]: "你确定这三个图都是 Paper Banana 生成的吗？感觉都非常丑啊，我需要有高级感、有美观度的图，这三个图都太廉价了"
   - [飞书用户 曹晓玉]: 6 specific modifications: (1) intro paragraphs 4-5 hierarchy, (2) intro paragraph 1 density, (3) abstract negative caveat, (4) title hook, (5) \cite→\citep/\citet, (6) limitations compression
   - [飞书用户 周俊伟]: Requested contributions expanded to 3 points + Code/Data Availability moved to appendix
   - [飞书用户 周俊伟]: "你增加的 contribution 真的是 contribution 吗？不是你编造的吧？是符合实验数据的吧？"
   - [飞书用户 周俊伟]: 3 major visual improvements: (1) shorten Related Work §3, (2a) add more figures/tables, (2b) unified professional color scheme, (3) every page except p1 needs figure/table at top

7. Pending Tasks:
   - **PaperBanana Figure 2 v8/v9 "premium"**: Dispatched to Main Agent with Nature/Science-level prompt, no result yet. User (曹晓玉) previously insisted "用PaperBanana画，不准放弃"
   - **Figure regeneration with new palette**: Main Agent dispatched to regenerate all 8 figures using updated palette.py colors. Also needs to fix 3 scripts that don't use palette.py (gen_fig3_alpha_routing.py, gen_fig3_jaccard_heatmap.py, gen_fig_method_overview.py)
   - **Add figures/tables to sparse pages**: Page 2 (intro/related work) and page 5 need visual elements. `fig3_alpha_routing` exists but isn't referenced in paper — candidate to add.
   - **Figure placement optimization**: Ensure all figures use [t] positioning for top-of-page placement
   - **Verify 8-page limit after all changes**: Related Work compression freed ~0.5 page; adding new figures/tables needs to stay within budget
   - **Compile and verify final layout**: After figures are regenerated

8. Current Work:
   Working on 周俊伟's 3 major visual improvement requests. Completed:
   - ✅ Related Work §3 compressed (~40% reduction, merged 2 paragraphs to 1)
   - ✅ palette.py updated with new professional color scheme
   - ✅ Main Agent dispatched to regenerate all 8 figures with new colors
   - ✅ Page layout analyzed: pages 2 and 5 lack top figures/tables
   - ✅ Discovered `fig3_alpha_routing.pdf` exists but is unused in paper — two-panel figure showing (a) ambiguity α across benchmarks and (b) confidence-based routing gains over majority vote

   Was about to:
   - Add `fig3_alpha_routing` figure to the experiments section (§4.1, near the "Confidence-based routing" paragraph) to add visual density
   - Potentially add a compact confidence margin table (AUC + threshold data from Appendix Tables 10/12) to main text to support 3rd contribution
   - Adjust figure LaTeX placement to ensure [t] positioning on all pages

9. Optional Next Step:
   Add `fig3_alpha_routing.pdf` as a new figure in `experiments.tex` near the routing discussion (after line 49, the "Confidence-based routing" paragraph). This directly addresses 周俊伟's request: "正文里的图表还是有点少。我希望增加一些对叙事质量非常重要的图和表，可以新加，也可以从附录里面拿。" The figure shows ambiguity α and routing gains — both directly support contributions 1 and 3. Then compile to check the updated page layout, verify 8-page compliance, and wait for Main Agent's figure regeneration results before doing final verification.

H3 \\citep{fu2023hungry} and Hyena \\citep{poli2023hyena} establish early design points in the hybrid space with gated convolutions and subquadratic operators. Mamba-2 \\citep{dao2024mamba2} establishes a duality between structured state spaces and attention; Mamba-3 \\citep{lahoti2026mamba3} extends the design further, while \\citet{ali2025hidden} reveal implicit attention within Mamba. Comparative evaluations confirm that hybrids outperform pure Transformers and SSMs at scale \\citep{waleffe2024empirical}, and that even one attention layer enables content-based routing \\citep{basu2026routing}. Recent theoretical work establishes a provable expressiveness hierarchy between hybrid and pure linear attention \\citep{ye2026provable}, providing formal grounding for the architectural differences we characterize at the per-example level. \\citet{wang2025hybrid} provide the controlled model zoo we use, holding training conditions constant while varying architecture and attention ratio.\n\n\\paragraph{Linear Recurrent Models.}\nOur three recurrent backbones represent distinct gating strategies within the linear recurrence family: RetNet \\citep{sun2023retnet} uses multi-scale exponential decay, HGRN2 \\citep{qin2024hgrn2} applies gated state expansion, and GatedDeltaNet \\citep{yang2024gateddeltanet} combines gated updates with delta rules. These descend from S4 \\citep{gu2022s4} and Mamba \\citep{gu2024mamba}, which introduced structured state spaces and input-dependent selection, respectively, and connect to linear attention \\citep{katharopoulos2020transformers} through the state-space--attention duality of Mamba-2.\n\n\\paragraph{Underspecification and Predictive Multiplicity.}\n\\citet{damour2022underspecification} formalized underspecification---equivalent aggregate performance masking per-prediction divergence---with NLP instances including seed-dependent BERT disagreement \\citep{mccoy2020berts,sellam2022multiberts}. \\citet{marx2020predictive} introduced predictive multiplicity, showing that near-optimal models produce conflicting per-example predictions; extensions address probabilistic settings \\citep{watson2023predictive}, Rashomon capacity \\citep{hsu2022rashomon}, and reconciliation \\citep{du2025reconciling,haghighat2026resolving}. These studies attribute divergence to initialization noise within a single architecture; Rashomon-set analyses \\citep{fisher2019all,semenova2022existence} and weight-space interpolation \\citep{wortsman2022model} operate within this scope. We show that changing the recurrent backbone---a qualitatively different source of variation---produces per-example multiplicity that varies by task type. Our routing approach relates to selective prediction \\citep{geifman2017selective} and ensemble selection \\citep{caruana2004ensemble}, though we select among architecturally distinct models. \\citet{yang2026benchmark} demonstrate analogous per-item disagreement (16--66\\%) among frontier LLMs; our within-family design isolates backbone variation from training-regime differences.\n",

        "content": "\\section{Introduction}\n\nHybrid linear recurrent architectures---including GatedDeltaNet (GDN), RetNet, HGRN2, Gated Linear Attention (GLA), and DeltaNet---achieve aggregate benchmark scores within 1--2 points of each other at matched parameter budgets, yet they can differ on up to 90\\% of the individual examples they affect. This per-example divergence is invisible in aggregate metrics: architectures that score similarly reach that score by gaining and losing on different inputs, and the choice of backbone carries hidden consequences for which specific examples a deployed system handles correctly.\n\nThis tension arises in the context of a rapid architectural shift toward hybrid recurrent-attention models, which interleave attention layers within linear recurrent backbones. Jamba \\citep{lieber2024jamba}, Griffin \\citep{de2024griffin}, RWKV-6 \\citep{peng2024eagle}, and RecurrentGemma \\citep{botev2024recurrentgemma} each combine recurrence with attention using different mixing strategies. These systems now serve as production-grade alternatives to pure Transformers, and the practical question of how much attention to include is typically answered by comparing aggregate benchmark numbers. \\citet{wang2025hybrid} provide a controlled model zoo spanning three recurrent architectures, five attention ratios, and two parameter scales, which enables systematic study of how attention allocation affects these hybrid designs.\n\nPrior work on predictive multiplicity \\citep{marx2020predictive} and underspecification \\citep{damour2022underspecification,mccoy2020berts} documents this risk for seed variation within a single architecture, but whether it extends to architectural variation in hybrid recurrent models remains open. If architectures that score similarly in aggregate behave differently on individual inputs, the backbone choice carries hidden consequences for deployment reliability and ensemble construction.\n\nWe present the first controlled within-family per-example analysis of how attention affects cross-architecture agreement in hybrid recurrent models. Using the model zoo of \\citet{wang2025hybrid}, we compare three architectures---GatedDeltaNet (gated delta rules), RetNet (multi-scale exponential decay), and HGRN2 (gated state expansion)---at five attention ratios (0--25\\%) and two scales (340M, 1.3B). We evaluate all 30 configurations on 10 benchmarks spanning retrieval, comprehension, reasoning, and mixed categories. On four benchmarks (LAMBADA, $N = 5{,}153$; HellaSwag, $N = 10{,}042$; PIQA, $N = 1{,}838$; ARC-Easy, $N = 2{,}376$) we conduct per-example decompositions, classifying each example as helped, hurt, or unchanged when attention is added, and measure cross-architecture overlap via Jaccard similarity. Figure~\\ref{fig:decoupling} previews our central finding: architectures that appear equivalent by aggregate benchmarks diverge systematically at the per-example level, and this divergence is established by minimal attention.\n\n\\begin{figure*}[t]\n\\centering\n\\begin{minipage}[t]{0.56\\textwidth}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{figures/fig1_decoupling_hero.pdf}\n\\end{minipage}%\n\\hfill\n\\begin{minipage}[t]{0.42\\textwidth}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{figures/fig4_jaccard_saturation.pdf}\n\\end{minipage}\n\\caption{Per-example overlap saturates at minimal attention across benchmarks. (a,\\,b) LAMBADA: cross-architecture $\\sigma$ shows a non-significant decreasing trend at 1.3B (solid; Bonferroni-adjusted $p = .170$) but partially rebounds at 340M (dashed), while pairwise Jaccard of helped/hurt sets saturates at 4\\% attention and remains flat. (c) This saturation generalizes: on all four main benchmarks, mean pairwise $\\bar{J}$ remains flat across attention ratios (all $\\rho \\leq 0.80$, $p \\geq .333$). Shaded bands are illustrative ($n = 3$).}\n\\label{fig:decoupling}\n\\end{figure*}\n\nOur central finding is that architectural variation produces structured predictive multiplicity whose magnitude depends on task type, not attention ratio. The ambiguity $\\alpha$ \\citep{marx2020predictive} ranges from 0.14 (PIQA) to 0.30 (LAMBADA), varies $2\\times$ across task types but only 0.03 within each benchmark across attention ratios; pairwise Jaccard remains uniformly low ($\\leq 0.10$, all $p < .01$ across all ten five-architecture pairs). A supporting observation is that this per-example overlap saturates at the first attention level (4\\%) and remains flat at higher ratios---even on LAMBADA, where aggregate variance shows a non-significant decreasing trend ($\\rho = -1.0$, Bonferroni-adjusted $p = .170$; at 1.3B only), per-example Jaccard does not change (\\S\\ref{ssec:decoupling}).\n\nOur contributions are as follows:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item Architectural variation in hybrid recurrent models---controlled within a single model zoo sharing training data and hyperparameters---produces structured predictive multiplicity whose magnitude varies by task type (or evaluation format) rather than attention ratio (\\S\\ref{ssec:per_example}). Five-architecture validation confirms the pattern (\\S\\ref{ssec:robustness}; Appendix~\\ref{app:extended_arch}).\n    \\item Per-example overlap saturates at the first attention level (4\\%) across all four benchmarks: minimal attention establishes which examples each architecture affects, and additional attention does not homogenize these per-example sets (\\S\\ref{ssec:decoupling}).\n    \\item Pure-model confidence margins partially predict which examples attention will affect (AUC 0.70--0.74), with rescue thresholds architecture-invariant but disruption thresholds varying 47\\% across architectures---a second dimension of multiplicity beyond per-example disagreement (\\S\\ref{ssec:per_example}; Appendix~\\ref{app:prediction_framework}).\n\\end{itemize}\n",

Using a controlled model zoo \\citep{wang2025hybrid} (three architectures, five attention ratios, two scales), we decompose per-example effects of adding attention and find structured predictive multiplicity \\citep{marx2020predictive}: pairwise overlap of helped and hurt example sets is uniformly low (Jaccard $\\approx 0.10$, roughly twice the independence baseline; all $p < .01$ across five architectures). This multiplicity varies by task type or evaluation format ($\\alpha = 0.14$--$0.30$) rather than attention ratio. Per-example overlap saturates at 4\\% attention and remains flat across higher ratios, indicating that minimal attention establishes which examples each architecture affects. \\citet{yang2026benchmark} document analogous per-item disagreement (16--66\\%) among frontier large language models (LLMs) despite comparable aggregate scores; our within-family design isolates backbone variation from training-regime differences. Confidence margins partially predict affected examples (area under the ROC curve [AUC] 0.70--0.74). Low cross-architecture overlap implies substantial complementarity, though routing-based exploitation remains task-dependent.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\input{sections/introduction}\n\n\\input{sections/related_work}\n\n\\input{sections/method}\n\n\\input{sections/experiments}\n\n\\input{sections/conclusion}\n\n\\section*{Limitations}\n\n\\paragraph{Single training runs.} Each configuration is a single training run; consistency across all 40 architecture--benchmark combinations (all $p < .01$) and a $3\\times$ within- vs.\\ cross-architecture Jaccard gap (within-seed $J$ is 2.7--4.3$\\times$ higher; Appendix~\\ref{app:seed_calibration}) mitigate seed confounds but cannot fully resolve them.\n\n\\paragraph{Format confound.} The confound between task type and evaluation format cannot be fully resolved: LAMBADA is the only free-form benchmark, so its higher $\\alpha$ may reflect format differences rather than cognitive demands alone.\n\n\\paragraph{Coverage.} We examine three primary architectures (plus two extended) from one model zoo, four main benchmarks, and two scale points. Generalization to Mamba, RWKV, other hybrid families, and generation tasks remains open; all four per-example benchmarks use discriminative scoring, so multiplicity under open-ended generation is untested.

```text
Based on the summary, I need to continue working on the visual improvements for the paper. The key pending tasks are:

1. Add `fig3_alpha_routing.pdf` as a new figure in `experiments.tex` near the routing discussion
2. Wait for Main Agent's figure regeneration results
3. Verify page layout and 8-page compliance

Let me first read the experiments.tex to find the right place to insert the figure, and also check what `fig3_alpha_routing` looks like (read the gen script to understand the content).
```
