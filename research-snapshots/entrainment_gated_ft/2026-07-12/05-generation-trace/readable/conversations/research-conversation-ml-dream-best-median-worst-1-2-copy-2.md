Key concerns: (1) only LAMBADA shows clear convergence — is the finding too narrow? (2) n=3 architectures — sufficient? (3) differentiation from Wang et al. who have the model zoo and noted qualitative convergence. (4) no 7B scale yet — two scales enough? Assess whether the equalizer paradox (aggregate convergence + per-example divergence) is novel and interesting enough for EMNLP Findings/Main.\n\n## paper_framing.md\n\n# Paper Framing — entrainment_gated_ft\n\n## Target Venue\n- Primary: EMNLP 2026 Main (via ARR)\n- Backup: EMNLP 2026 Findings\n- Deadline: ARR June 2026 cycle (submission ~June 15)\n\n## Paper Type\nEmpirical analysis paper (not method paper)\n\n## Core Claims (3 条)\n\n### Claim 1: Task-Specific Equalizer Effect\nAdding attention layers to different linear recurrent architectures (GatedDeltaNet, RetNet, HGRN2) induces aggregate performance convergence whose strength scales with task retrieval demand—strongest on LAMBADA (ρ=-1.0, cross-arch std drops 79%), suggestive on ARC-Easy (ρ=-0.7, underpowered), absent on reasoning-heavy tasks (HellaSwag, WinoGrande). This continuous relationship between retrieval demand and convergence strength is a key finding, not a limitation of single-task significance.\n\n### Claim 2: Scale-Dependent Convergence\nThe convergence effect is scale-dependent: monotonically complete at 1.3B parameters (Spearman ρ=-1.0 for cross-arch std vs attention ratio, exact permutation p=0.0083) but only partial at 340M with a non-monotonic rebound at high attention ratios. Note: only two scale points available (Wang et al. do not provide 7B models); this is a binary contrast, not a multi-point trend. Paper must frame honestly as \"scale matters\" without implying extrapolation.\n\n### Claim 3: Architecture-Specific Mechanism (Equalizer Paradox)\nDespite aggregate convergence, attention acts on almost entirely different sample subsets per architecture (pairwise Jaccard < 0.10). GDN and RetNet are hurt (net negative on LAMBADA), HGRN2 is helped (net positive), with symmetric effect magnitudes—convergence emerges from complementary, not redundant, mechanisms.\n\n## Story Spine\n\n### Problem\nHybrid architectures mixing linear recurrence with full attention are becoming the dominant paradigm for efficient language models. A critical open question: does adding attention homogenize model behavior across different recurrence mechanisms, or do architecture-specific effects persist?\n\n### Existing Approaches & Gaps\nWang et al. (2025, arXiv 2507.06457) provide the most comprehensive model zoo (72 models, 3 architectures, multiple scales and attention ratios) but report only aggregate metrics. They qualitatively note convergence trends but do not analyze: (a) the per-example mechanism, (b) scale dependency of convergence, (c) task-specificity, or (d) why architectures converge to similar *aggregate* performance through *different* individual-sample effects.\n\n### Our Framing\nWe provide the first quantitative characterization of the \"equalizer effect\"—a systematic per-example analysis revealing that attention creates aggregate performance convergence through architecture-specific, largely non-overlapping mechanisms. This \"equalizer paradox\" (aggregate convergence + per-example divergence) has direct implications for architecture selection: even when aggregate metrics converge, the types of inputs each architecture handles well remain architecture-specific.\n\n### Headline Result Template\n\"At 1.3B scale, adding attention layers reduces cross-architecture performance variance by 79% on LAMBADA (std 0.024→0.005), yet per-example analysis reveals the affected sample subsets are almost entirely non-overlapping across architectures (Jaccard < 0.10), with symmetric but opposite effect directions.\"\n\n## Venue Fit Risks\n\n### Risk 1: Architecture Analysis vs NLP\nEMNLP is NLP-focused; this paper is closer to architecture analysis. **Mitigation**: Frame in terms of understanding language model behavior on specific linguistic tasks. Anchor analysis to token-level and context-level linguistic features (frequency, context length, retrieval demand). Include practical recommendations for practitioners choosing hybrid architectures for specific NLP tasks.\n\n### Risk 2: Limited Task Coverage\nCurrently only LAMBADA shows clear convergence. **Mitigation**: (a) Extend per-example analysis to HellaSwag and other benchmarks, (b) provide principled explanation of LAMBADA's retrieval-dependent nature vs reasoning tasks, (c) if convergence appears on other retrieval tasks, strengthens Claim 1; if not, reframe as \"convergence is task-type-specific\" which is still interesting.\n\n### Risk 3: Small Architecture Sample\nOnly 3 architectures (GDN, RetNet, HGRN2). **Mitigation**: These represent three distinct recurrence mechanisms (gated delta rule, linear attention with exponential decay, hierarchical gated recurrence). Check if Wang et al. have additional architectures or scales. n=3 is sufficient for the per-example analysis which is our main contribution.\n\n### Risk 4: Wang et al. Overlap\nThey have the model zoo AND qualitative convergence observation. **Mitigation**: Our contribution is explicitly about what they did NOT do: quantitative convergence framework, scale-dependent analysis, per-example mechanism analysis. Frame as \"using their excellent model zoo, we discover a deeper phenomenon they missed.\"\n\n## Anticipated Reviewer Concerns\n\n### Concern A: \"This is just a negative result from a failed hypothesis\"\nResponse: Frame as discovery paper. The equalizer effect is a positive finding—it was not the hypothesis we started with, but it's a genuine empirical phenomenon with theoretical implications. Many impactful papers come from unexpected findings.\nRequired evidence: Strong standalone story; no mention of original entrainment hypothesis in the paper.\n\n### Concern B: \"Only one task shows the effect\" + Post-hoc taxonomy risk\nResponse: Do NOT use binary retrieval/reasoning split — vulnerable to post-hoc cherry-picking (only 1 benchmark in \"retrieval\" category, exactly the one that's significant). Instead:\n1. **Continuous spectrum**: Plot convergence strength (Spearman ρ) against a continuous measure of \"retrieval demand\" per benchmark. LAMBADA ρ=-1.0, ARC-E ρ=-0.7 (suggestive), ARC-C ρ=-0.3, HellaSwag/WinoGrande/MMLU near zero. Frame as dose-response: more retrieval demand → stronger convergence.\n2. **Cite existing task taxonomies**: Use BIG-bench taxonomy or other published meta-analyses for task property classification — don't invent our own post-hoc.\n3. **Honest reporting**: ARC-E ρ=-0.7 (p=0.117) is \"suggestive but underpowered\" — n=5 ratios means low statistical power. Continuous spectrum framing turns \"only LAMBADA significant\" into \"graded effect consistent with retrieval demand.\"\n4. **Winogrande ambiguity**: Coreference resolution has a retrieval component (finding antecedent). Acknowledge this honestly rather than forcing it into \"reasoning.\"\n5. **exp-002 validation**: If HellaSwag per-example analysis confirms no convergence at sample level, upgrades from \"aggregate not significant\" to \"per-example confirmed non-converging.\"\nRequired experiments: exp-001 (done, PASS on dichotomy), exp-002 (per-example validation), exp-003 (sample characterization).\n\n### Concern C: \"No causal mechanism\"\nResponse: Per-example analysis provides mechanistic evidence (different subsets). Strengthen with attention weight visualization and sample feature characterization.\nRequired experiments: Sample characterization (exp-003), attention weight analysis (exp-004).\n\n### Concern D: \"n=3 architectures is too few\"\nResponse: Three architectures with 5 attention ratios × 2 scales = 30 models. The per-example analysis provides thousands of data points. Check if additional architectures available.\nRequired experiments: Architecture expansion check (exp-005).\n\n### Concern E: \"Two scales don't establish a trend\"\nResponse: 7B unavailable (Wang et al. capped at 1.3B). Frame as \"binary contrast showing scale is a necessary condition\" — convergence requires sufficient model capacity (1.3B), not just attention. Strengthen via exp-007 (340M rebound mechanism analysis) to provide mechanistic explanation for the scale gap. Acknowledge as limitation; do not imply extrapolation.\nRequired experiments: exp-007 (340M rebound mechanism).\n\n\n## experiment_plan (with registry status)\n\n- id: exp-001\n  claim: 1\n  title: Task-specificity characterization of equalizer effect\n  description: 'Compute cross-architecture variance (std) at each attention ratio\n    for all 6 benchmarks.

## Core Claims (3 条)

### Claim 1: Task-Specific Equalizer Effect
Adding attention layers to different linear recurrent architectures (GatedDeltaNet, RetNet, HGRN2) induces aggregate performance convergence whose strength scales with task retrieval demand—strongest on LAMBADA (ρ=-1.0, cross-arch std drops 79%), suggestive on ARC-Easy (ρ=-0.7, underpowered), absent on reasoning-heavy tasks (HellaSwag, WinoGrande). This continuous relationship between retrieval demand and convergence strength is a key finding, not a limitation of single-task significance.

### Claim 2: Scale-Dependent Convergence
The convergence effect is scale-dependent: monotonically complete at 1.3B parameters (Spearman ρ=-1.0 for cross-arch std vs attention ratio, exact permutation p=0.0083) but only partial at 340M with a non-monotonic rebound at high attention ratios. Note: only two scale points available (Wang et al. do not provide 7B models); this is a binary contrast, not a multi-point trend. Paper must frame honestly as "scale matters" without implying extrapolation.

### Claim 3: Architecture-Specific Mechanism (Equalizer Paradox)
Despite aggregate convergence, attention acts on almost entirely different sample subsets per architecture (pairwise Jaccard < 0.10). GDN and RetNet are hurt (net negative on LAMBADA), HGRN2 is helped (net positive), with symmetric effect magnitudes—convergence emerges from complementary, not redundant, mechanisms.

## Story Spine

### Problem
Hybrid architectures mixing linear recurrence with full attention are becoming the dominant paradigm for efficient language models. A critical open question: does adding attention homogenize model behavior across different recurrence mechanisms, or do architecture-specific effects persist?

### Existing Approaches & Gaps
Wang et al. (2025, arXiv 2507.06457) provide the most comprehensive model zoo (72 models, 3 architectures, multiple scales and attention ratios) but report only aggregate metrics. They qualitatively note convergence trends but do not analyze: (a) the per-example mechanism, (b) scale dependency of convergence, (c) task-specificity, or (d) why architectures converge to similar *aggregate* performance through *different* individual-sample effects.

### Our Framing
We provide the first quantitative characterization of the "equalizer effect"—a systematic per-example analysis revealing that attention creates aggregate performance convergence through architecture-specific, largely non-overlapping mechanisms. This "equalizer paradox" (aggregate convergence + per-example divergence) has direct implications for architecture selection: even when aggregate metrics converge, the types of inputs each architecture handles well remain architecture-specific.

### Headline Result Template
"At 1.3B scale, adding attention layers reduces cross-architecture performance variance by 79% on LAMBADA (std 0.024→0.005), yet per-example analysis reveals the affected sample subsets are almost entirely non-overlapping across architectures (Jaccard < 0.10), with symmetric but opposite effect directions."

## Venue Fit Risks

### Risk 1: Architecture Analysis vs NLP
EMNLP is NLP-focused; this paper is closer to architecture analysis. **Mitigation**: Frame in terms of understanding language model behavior on specific linguistic tasks. Anchor analysis to token-level and context-level linguistic features (frequency, context length, retrieval demand). Include practical recommendations for practitioners choosing hybrid architectures for specific NLP tasks.

### Risk 2: Limited Task Coverage
Currently only LAMBADA shows clear convergence. **Mitigation**: (a) Extend per-example analysis to HellaSwag and other benchmarks, (b) provide principled explanation of LAMBADA's retrieval-dependent nature vs reasoning tasks, (c) if convergence appears on other retrieval tasks, strengthens Claim 1; if not, reframe as "convergence is task-type-specific" which is still interesting.

### Risk 3: Small Architecture Sample
Only 3 architectures (GDN, RetNet, HGRN2). **Mitigation**: These represent three distinct recurrence mechanisms (gated delta rule, linear attention with exponential decay, hierarchical gated recurrence). Check if Wang et al. have additional architectures or scales. n=3 is sufficient for the per-example analysis which is our main contribution.

### Risk 4: Wang et al. Overlap
They have the model zoo AND qualitative convergence observation. **Mitigation**: Our contribution is explicitly about what they did NOT do: quantitative convergence framework, scale-dependent analysis, per-example mechanism analysis. Frame as "using their excellent model zoo, we discover a deeper phenomenon they missed."

## Anticipated Reviewer Concerns

### Concern A: "This is just a negative result from a failed hypothesis"
Response: Frame as discovery paper. The equalizer effect is a positive finding—it was not the hypothesis we started with, but it's a genuine empirical phenomenon with theoretical implications. Many impactful papers come from unexpected findings.
Required evidence: Strong standalone story; no mention of original entrainment hypothesis in the paper.

### Concern B: "Only one task shows the effect" + Post-hoc taxonomy risk
Response: Do NOT use binary retrieval/reasoning split — vulnerable to post-hoc cherry-picking (only 1 benchmark in "retrieval" category, exactly the one that's significant). Instead:
1. **Continuous spectrum**: Plot convergence strength (Spearman ρ) against a continuous measure of "retrieval demand" per benchmark. LAMBADA ρ=-1.0, ARC-E ρ=-0.7 (suggestive), ARC-C ρ=-0.3, HellaSwag/WinoGrande/MMLU near zero. Frame as dose-response: more retrieval demand → stronger convergence.
2. **Cite existing task taxonomies**: Use BIG-bench taxonomy or other published meta-analyses for task property classification — don't invent our own post-hoc.
3. **Honest reporting**: ARC-E ρ=-0.7 (p=0.117) is "suggestive but underpowered" — n=5 ratios means low statistical power. Continuous spectrum framing turns "only LAMBADA significant" into "graded effect consistent with retrieval demand."
4. **Winogrande ambiguity**: Coreference resolution has a retrieval component (finding antecedent). Acknowledge this honestly rather than forcing it into "reasoning."
5. **exp-002 validation**: If HellaSwag per-example analysis confirms no convergence at sample level, upgrades from "aggregate not significant" to "per-example confirmed non-converging."
Required experiments: exp-001 (done, PASS on dichotomy), exp-002 (per-example validation), exp-003 (sample characterization).

### Concern C: "No causal mechanism"
Response: Per-example analysis provides mechanistic evidence (different subsets). Strengthen with attention weight visualization and sample feature characterization.
Required experiments: Sample characterization (exp-003), attention weight analysis (exp-004).

### Concern D: "n=3 architectures is too few"
Response: Three architectures with 5 attention ratios × 2 scales = 30 models. The per-example analysis provides thousands of data points. Check if additional architectures available.
Required experiments: Architecture expansion check (exp-005).

### Concern E: "Two scales don't establish a trend"
Response: 7B unavailable (Wang et al. capped at 1.3B). Frame as "binary contrast showing scale is a necessary condition" — convergence requires sufficient model capacity (1.3B), not just attention. Strengthen via exp-007 (340M rebound mechanism analysis) to provide mechanistic explanation for the scale gap. Acknowledge as limitation; do not imply extrapolation.
Required experiments: exp-007 (340M rebound mechanism).

<details><summary>Logged reasoning block</summary>

```text
The user wants me to define three tiers (best/median/worst) for a Dream simulation based on their research project about the "equalizer effect" in hybrid linear recurrent + attention architectures. Let me analyze the project context carefully and produce a well-reasoned YAML output.

Key facts from the context:
- Project: entrainment_gated_ft, pivoted from failed entrainment hypothesis to equalizer effect
- Venue: EMNLP 2026 (Main or Findings)
- 3 claims: task-specific equalizer effect, scale-dependent convergence, architecture-specific mechanism (equalizer paradox)


- Current data: LAMBADA shows strong convergence evidence (ρ=-1.0, 79% std reduction, Jaccard <0.10), ARC-Easy is suggestive (ρ=-0.7), others lack significance
- Limited scope: only 3 architectures (GDN, RetNet, HGRN2), 2 scales (340M, 1.3B), missing 7B scale
- Several critical experiments still pending: multi-benchmark per-example analysis, sample characterization, attention weight inspection, 340M rebound testing, and statistical robustness checks

Now I'm thinking through what best/median/worst scenarios look like for this project. The best case would be if all pending experiments validate the equalizer effect across multiple benchmarks and scales, showing the mechanism holds consistently. The median case is where we get partial validation—maybe the effect replicates on a few more tasks but not universally, or the mechanism is clearer but scale-dependence remains ambiguous. The worst case is if the effect doesn't generalize beyond LAMBADA, or if the pending experiments reveal confounds that undermine the core claims. All pending experiments confirm and strengthen the story
- exp-002: Per-example analysis on HellaSwag/ARC confirms task-specificity (no convergence on reasoning tasks at per-example level, confirming the continuous spectrum)
- exp-003: Sample characterization finds clear, interpretable features differentiating helped/hurt samples across architectures
- exp-004: Attention weights show distinct patterns correlating with per-example effects
- exp-007: 340M rebound has clear mechanistic explanation
- exp-008: All claims survive with GDN excluded, bootstrap CIs solid
- exp-005: Additional architecture found and confirms convergence
- ARC-Easy might show stronger signal with per-example analysis
- The continuous retrieval-demand spectrum holds up

**Median case**: Partial confirmation where exp-002 shows no convergence on HellaSwag but ARC results stay ambiguous, exp-003 finds only weak feature differentiation across architectures, exp-004 shows faint attention correlations, and exp-008's confidence intervals widen when excluding GDN—forcing me to soften claims and possibly target just the Findings section.

**Worst case**: The core task-specificity claim breaks if per-example analysis reveals convergence on non-retrieval tasks too, no interpretable features emerge to explain the helped/hurt distinction, GDN exclusion invalidates the results entirely, and the whole paradox dissolves into noise.

Now I'm identifying the specific metrics that matter most for evaluating these scenarios. I'm tracking cross-architecture standard deviation reduction on LAMBADA, correlation strengths between convergence and attention patterns, Jaccard similarity across feature sets, confidence interval widths, how many benchmarks show the pattern, effect sizes for sample characterization, and whether the core claims hold when removing potential confounds. Let me define clear thresholds for what counts as strong, moderate, or weak evidence across each metric. LAMBADA convergence: bootstrap CI for std reduction [70%, 85%], confirming the 79%
- ρ LAMBADA: [-1.0, -0.9] (remains strong)
- ρ ARC-Easy: [-0.9, -0.6] (strengthens with per-example data)
- Benchmarks with ρ < -0.5: 2-3 (LAMBADA + ARC-E + possibly another)
- Jaccard: [0.03, 0.10] (stays very low)
- Sample feature p-value: < 0.001 (strong differentiation)
- Attention correlation: > 0.4
- GDN exclusion: claims survive
- Additional architectures: 1+ tested, confirms

Under the median scenario, the LAMBADA effect weakens considerably with a wider confidence interval spanning 55-80%, and the correlation coefficients become less decisive—LAMBADA drops to [-1.0, -0.7] while ARC-Easy shows only modest negative correlation. The worst case is even more pessimistic, with the bootstrap interval potentially crossing zero and correlations falling below significance thresholds after multiple comparison corrections, leaving only LAMBADA as a clearly robust finding.

I'm reconsidering what these robustness checks actually measure—the LAMBADA correlation and permutation test are already computed from the data, so the real question is whether those results hold up under resampling and whether the effect generalizes across other benchmarks and architectures. Let me refocus the metrics around what the pending experiments will actually reveal.

Drafting the YAML structure now...

      depth 降低——从 "causal mechanism" 降为 "suggestive mechanistic evidence"。标题改为更保守的
      "Aggregate Convergence, Per-Example Divergence: How Attention Reshapes Hybrid Recurrent
      Architectures on Retrieval Tasks"。主投 Findings，若 reviewer 反馈积极可争取 Main。
      需补充 limitations 段落诚实讨论 n=3 和单任务问题。

  worst:
    meaning: "核心数值被 robustness check 削弱或 GDN confound 致命；equalizer paradox 的新颖性不足以独立成文；需 reframe angle"
    key_assumptions:
      - "exp-008: 排除 GDN 后 LAMBADA ρ 升至 >-0.6（不显著），79% std reduction 依赖 GDN 的 D004 confound"
      - "exp-002: 非 LAMBADA 任务 per-example 分析反而显示弱收敛，破坏 task-specificity 叙事"
      - "exp-003: 无 feature 通过 p<0.01，helped/hurt sample 无可解释结构"
      - "exp-004: attention pattern 与 per-example effect 相关性 <0.2，无 mechanistic story"
      - "exp-007: 340M rebound 无法解释，scale contrast 退化为 unexplained observation"
      - "Jaccard 在 bootstrap 下 CI 上界 >0.20，paradox 程度大幅减弱"
      - "Wang et al. 的 qualitative convergence 观察已覆盖了我们的大部分 aggregate 发现，incremental contribution 不足"

    narrative_direction: >
      原始三条 claim 均无法以当前强度成立。Reframe 策略（仍冲 EMNLP，不降级）：放弃 "equalizer effect"
      作为核心贡献，转向 **per-example analysis methodology paper**。新 angle: "Per-Example Probing
      Reveals Hidden Heterogeneity in Hybrid Architecture Evaluations"——核心论点变为：aggregate
      benchmark 评估掩盖了架构间的 per-example 行为差异，即使 aggregate 指标相近，底层机制完全不同。
      这是一个 methodology + cautionary tale 的 framing：(1) 提出 per-example divergence metrics
      (Jaccard, net-effect asymmetry) 作为评估工具，(2) 用 Wang et al. model zoo 做 case study
      展示 aggregate metric 的盲区，(3) 给出 practitioner recommendation——选架构时不能只看
      leaderboard 数字。即使 equalizer effect 本身不 robust，per-example heterogeneity 的存在
      及其对架构选择的 implication 仍是 solid contribution。标题: "Beyond Aggregate Benchmarks:
      Per-Example Analysis Exposes Architecture-Specific Behavior in Hybrid Language Models"。
      投 EMNLP Findings。
