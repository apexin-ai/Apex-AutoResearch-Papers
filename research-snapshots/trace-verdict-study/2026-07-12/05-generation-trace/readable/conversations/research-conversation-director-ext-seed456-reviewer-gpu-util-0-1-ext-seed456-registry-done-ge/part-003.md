Figure~\\ref{fig:ppl_trends} shows per-generation perplexity trajectories. We organize findings around three primary claims and one directional observation.\n\n\\subsection{RGDS Produces Catastrophic Perplexity Degradation}\n\\label{sec:result_c1}\n\nRGDS is the only method that exhibits catastrophic performance degradation across generations. At Generation~7, RGDS reaches a perplexity of $78.32 \\pm 4.60$ ($n{=}2$\\textsuperscript{$\\dagger$}), compared to $47.04 \\pm 2.90$ for Uncurated ($n{=}3$; +66\\%) and $43.18 \\pm 1.43$ for Random~50\\% ($n{=}3$; +82\\%). Both completed seeds show the same pattern: 75.07 (seed=42) and 81.57 (seed=123), with effect sizes that exceed inter-seed variance within any other method by an order of magnitude.\n\nThe selection ratio traces the mechanism behind this degradation. RGDS's selection ratio follows an overall declining trend from ${\\sim}1.04$ at Generation~0 to $0.52 \\pm 0.004$ at Generation~7, with a transient rebound during Generations~1--3 ($0.91 \\to 0.93 \\to 0.94$) before sustained decline from Generation~4 onward. By the final generation, RGDS preferentially retains vocabulary-poor samples: its selected subsets contain approximately half the rare trigram density of the full generated pool. The model's internal notion of ``diverse'' has inverted relative to content diversity.\n\n% TODO: seed=456 RGDS 完成后更新为 n=3 mean±std 并补充统计检验 p 值\n\n\\subsection{External Embeddings Avoid the Alignment Gap}\n\\label{sec:result_c2}\n\nExternal-only selection applies the identical selection algorithm and 50\\% data budget but uses frozen Contriever embeddings. It avoids catastrophic degradation entirely: its Generation~7 perplexity of $47.59 \\pm 2.93$ ($n{=}2$\\textsuperscript{$\\dagger$}) falls within the range of Uncurated ($47.04 \\pm 2.90$) and Random~50\\% ($43.18 \\pm 1.43$).\n\nExternal-only maintains a selection ratio above~1.0 throughout all generations ($1.11 \\pm 0.02$ at Generation~7), indicating continued preferential retention of content-diverse samples. Its rank correlation between diversity scores and rare token content remains weakly positive ($+0.011 \\pm 0.000$; Table~\\ref{tab:gen7_summary}), while RGDS's correlation turns negative ($-0.035 \\pm 0.005$).\n\nSince RGDS and External-only differ in exactly one variable---the embedding source---the 30.7-point perplexity gap at Generation~7 ($78.32$ vs.\\ $47.59$) is directly attributable to the use of co-degrading internal representations. The selection algorithm is not at fault; the failure is specific to coupling data selection to embeddings that co-evolve with the collapsing model.\n\nNotably, External-only does not significantly outperform Random~50\\% in perplexity ($46.36 \\pm 2.97$ vs.\\ $43.18 \\pm 1.43$; $p = 0.171$, two-sided $t$-test, $n{=}3$). Despite maintaining a selection ratio above~1.0, the ``intelligent'' diversity signal from frozen external embeddings provides no measurable advantage over uninformed random subsampling. This null result reinforces the practical implication discussed in \\S\\ref{sec:discussion}: random sampling is a zero-cost alternative that matches the performance of embedding-guided selection when embeddings are stable and avoids the catastrophic failure when they are not.\n\n% TODO: seed=456 ext/rgds 完成后更新为 n=3 mean±std 并补充 RGDS vs External t 检验\n\n\\subsection{Internal Selection Underperforms Random Baseline}\n\\label{sec:result_c3}\n\nThe comparison between RGDS and Random~50\\% provides the cleanest controlled ablation: both use the same 50\\% data budget, isolating the effect of the selection mechanism itself. RGDS's Generation~7 perplexity ($78.32 \\pm 4.60$, $n{=}2$\\textsuperscript{$\\dagger$}) exceeds Random~50\\% ($43.18 \\pm 1.43$, $n{=}3$) by 82\\%. Internal embedding diversity selection does not merely fail to improve upon random sampling---it actively degrades model quality relative to uninformed selection.\n\nRare token ratio confirms this finding: RGDS retains $0.0057 \\pm 0.0008$ at Generation~7, compared to $0.0098 \\pm 0.0003$ for Random~50\\%---a 42\\% reduction in lexical tail content.\n\n\\subsection{Random Pruning: A Directional Observation}\n\\label{sec:result_s3}\n\nRandom~50\\% ($43.18 \\pm 1.43$, $n{=}3$) achieves lower Generation~7 perplexity than Uncurated ($47.04 \\pm 2.90$, $n{=}3$), a reduction of 8.2\\%. The direction is consistent across all three seeds. However, this difference does not reach conventional significance ($p \\approx 0.10$, two-sided $t$-test), and we report it as a directional observation rather than a confirmed finding.\n\nIf confirmed with additional statistical power, this result would suggest that training on a random 50\\% subset provides mild regularization compared to using all generated data in the iterative self-training setting, consistent with observations that data pruning can improve generalization even without informed selection \\citep{sorscher2022beyond}.\n\nWhile the perplexity difference remains directional, Random~50\\% shows a statistically significant advantage in lexical diversity: its Generation~7 rare n-gram ratio ($0.0098 \\pm 0.0003$) exceeds Uncurated ($0.0090 \\pm 0.0004$) with $p = 0.025$ (two-sided $t$-test, $n{=}3$). Even uninformed subsampling preserves content diversity better than retaining all generated data, suggesting that the diversity benefit of curation does not require intelligent selection---merely reducing the volume of self-generated training data slows lexical tail erosion.\n\n\\subsection{Lexical Diversity Collapse Across Methods}\n\\label{sec:result_diversity}\n\nRGDS exhibits the sharpest decline in rare token ratio, dropping from approximately 0.010 at Generation~0 to $0.0057 \\pm 0.0008$ at Generation~7 (Table~\\ref{tab:gen7_summary}). The remaining methods converge to a narrower band: Random~50\\% ($0.0098 \\pm 0.0003$), Uncurated ($0.0090 \\pm 0.0004$), and External-only ($0.0102 \\pm 0.0004$). Relative to the WikiText-103 baseline rare token ratio of approximately 0.029, all non-RGDS methods exhibit roughly 65\\% lexical tail erosion by Generation~7; RGDS reaches approximately 80\\%.\n\nUnlike the perplexity-level normal cluster (ANOVA $p = 0.219$; \\S\\ref{sec:result_c1}), the rare n-gram differences among non-RGDS methods are statistically significant (ANOVA $p = 0.007$, $n{=}3$ per method). In particular, Uncurated retains significantly fewer rare n-grams than Random~50\\% ($p = 0.025$, two-sided $t$-test). Lexical diversity collapse is primarily driven by the iterative self-training loop itself \\citep{shumailov2024ai}, but the degree of erosion is modulated by data selection: even uninformed curation (random subsampling) provides measurable protection relative to using all generated data. RGDS is distinctive in accelerating this inherent degradation far beyond all other methods.\n\n\\subsection{Representation Metrics Do Not Track Content Collapse}\n\\label{sec:result_rankme}\n\nRankMe values at Generation~7 are comparable across all methods (289--296; Table~\\ref{tab:gen7_summary}), with RGDS showing a slightly elevated value ($295.54 \\pm 3.98$) relative to the other methods (${\\sim}290$). The metric designed to track effective embedding dimensionality does not distinguish between catastrophically degraded RGDS and the normally performing alternatives, indicating that embedding structural properties can persist even as the space loses content-discriminative fidelity.\n\n\\subsection{Scaling to GPT2-Medium (355M)}\n\\label{sec:result_scaling}\n\nPreliminary results from GPT2-Medium (355M) confirm that model collapse generalizes to larger models and is substantially amplified (Table~\\ref{tab:medium_uncurated}). The Uncurated baseline perplexity increases by 245\\% over 8 generations (26.55 to 91.66, seed=42, $n{=}1$), compared to 28\\% for GPT2-125M (36.7 to 47.04, $n{=}3$). RankMe inflation increases by $+$72.4 points (vs.\\ $+$11.1 for GPT2-125M), and the rank correlation between embedding diversity scores and rare token content turns negative at Generation~4, following the same trajectory observed in the smaller model.\n\nThe amplified baseline degradation at 355M parameters suggests that the embedding alignment gap may produce even more severe outcomes when RGDS is applied at this scale: if the Uncurated floor itself is worse, the additional degradation introduced by co-degrading internal embeddings could compound further. \\placeholder{GPT2-Medium RGDS Generation~7 perplexity and selection ratio to confirm or disconfirm this prediction.}\n\n% TODO: GPT2-medium RGDS/External/Random 完成后补充完整 4-method 对比和统计检验\n",

        "content": "\\section{Introduction}\n\nTraining language models on their own generated data across multiple iterations leads to \\emph{model collapse}---a progressive degradation in both output quality and lexical diversity \\citep{shumailov2024ai, alemohammad2024self}. Each generation of synthetic data carries distributional artifacts from its parent model; when these artifacts compound across iterations, the distribution's tails erode and the model converges toward a narrow, repetitive mode \\citep{seddik2024how, briesch2023large, guo2024curious}. As synthetic data becomes an increasingly prevalent component of training pipelines, understanding this feedback loop---and identifying strategies that avoid it---has become a pressing concern \\citep{dohmatob2025strong, gerstgrasser2024model}.\n\nDiversity-based data curation is a natural mitigation strategy. If model collapse arises from training on redundant or low-quality synthetic samples, then selecting a maximally diverse subset should preserve the distributional richness that iterative training erodes. Submodular maximization over embedding spaces provides a principled framework for this goal: submodular diversity objectives identify representative subsets that maximize geometric coverage of the data distribution \\citep{wei2015submodularity, mirzasoleiman2020coresets}. Embedding-based selection has demonstrated strong results in data pruning \\citep{sorscher2022beyond} and data-efficient training more broadly \\citep{xie2023data, xia2024less, engstrom2024dsdm}. When the model's own representations define the embedding space, diversity selection should---in principle---directly counteract the homogenization that drives collapse.\n\nWe test this intuition in a controlled iterative self-training experiment and find the opposite of the expected outcome. Representation-Guided Diversity Selection (RGDS)---which selects the most diverse 50\\% of synthetic data according to the training model's own last-hidden-layer embeddings---increases Generation~7 perplexity by +74\\% relative to random selection under the same 50\\% data budget (75.07 vs.\\ 43.20, seed=42).%\n%TODO(3-seed): replace seed=42 numbers with mean+-std across 3 seeds once seed=456 completes\nRare n-gram density in RGDS-selected text drops by 47\\% compared to random selection (0.0051 vs.\\ 0.0096; seed=42). The method designed to preserve diversity accelerates collapse instead. This result replicates across seeds: RGDS produces Generation~7 perplexities of 75.07 (seed=42) and 81.57 (seed=123), while all other methods---random selection, external-embedding selection, and no selection---remain between 41 and 51.%\n%TODO(3-seed): add seed=456 results and report mean+-std\n\nThe failure exposes a gap in the data selection literature. Methods such as SemDeDup \\citep{abbas2023semdedup}, D4 \\citep{tirumala2023d4}, and DSIR \\citep{xie2023data} are designed for one-shot curation of static datasets, where the model providing embeddings is fixed and its representation quality is not in question. Active learning methods account for model updates between selection rounds \\citep{ash2020deep, kirsch2019batchbald}, but they do not address the compound effect of selection bias feeding back into the selecting model's own training data across generations. The concept drift literature establishes that learned representations degrade under sustained distribution shift \\citep{lu2019learning, gama2014survey}, but no prior work examines how this degradation interacts with embedding-based data selection in a self-consuming training loop---a setting where the model that selects the data is also the model whose next generation of representations is shaped by that selection.\n\nWe identify the mechanism behind this failure as the \\emph{embedding alignment gap}: a progressive divergence between what the model's internal representations treat as ``diverse'' and what constitutes genuine content diversity. To quantify this divergence, we define the \\emph{selection ratio}---the mean rare n-gram density of the selected subset divided by that of the full generated pool. A selection ratio above~1 indicates that the method preferentially retains content-rich samples; below~1 indicates preferential retention of content-poor samples. For RGDS, the selection ratio follows an overall declining trend from 1.04 at Generation~0 to 0.52 at Generation~7 (seed=42),%\n%TODO(3-seed): update selection ratio trajectory with mean+-std across 3 seeds\nwith a transient rebound in Generations~2--4 before sustained decline. By the final generation, RGDS actively selects for vocabulary-poor samples, and its selected subsets contain 47\\% fewer rare n-grams than random selection produces. The model's internal notion of diversity has inverted relative to content diversity. This trajectory is consistent with dimensional collapse in the embedding space \\citep{jing2022understanding, hua2021feature}: as the model trains on increasingly homogeneous data, its effective representational dimensionality shrinks, formerly distinct content regions merge, and the selection algorithm maximizes coverage of a space that no longer encodes the distinctions that matter.\n\nThe sharpest evidence for the embedding alignment gap comes from comparing methods that share identical selection budgets and algorithms but differ only in their embedding source. All methods that bypass the model's internal embeddings cluster in a band of moderate degradation at Generation~7: Random~50\\% reaches perplexity 43.20, External-only selection using frozen Contriever \\citep{izacard2022unsupervised} embeddings reaches 45.51, and the Uncurated baseline using 100\\% of generated data reaches 50.28---all at seed=42 ($n{=}1$). The pattern holds with seed=123 (Random 41.75, External-only 49.66, Uncurated 46.15).%\n%TODO(3-seed): add seed=456 cluster and report mean+-std for all methods\nOnly RGDS---the sole method coupling selection to the training model's own representations---produces catastrophic outcomes: 75.07 and 81.57 across the two seeds. The External-only method is particularly informative: it applies the same greedy diversity selection algorithm as RGDS with the same 50\\% budget, but uses a frozen Contriever encoder whose embeddings do not co-degrade with the training model. Its Generation~7 perplexity (45.51) falls within the normal cluster, confirming that the selection algorithm itself is not at fault. The failure arises specifically from using co-degrading internal embeddings as the selection criterion---a form of Goodhart's law in representation space \\citep{gao2023scaling, karwowski2024goodhart}, where optimizing for diversity as measured by the model's own embeddings ceases to track actual content diversity once those embeddings lose fidelity.\n\nOur contributions are as follows:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item We define the \\emph{selection ratio}, a diagnostic metric that quantifies the alignment between a selection method's diversity criterion and content diversity, and show that it tracks the onset of catastrophic failure---declining from 1.04 to 0.52 across 8 generations for RGDS.\n    \\item We demonstrate that internal-embedding diversity selection accelerates model collapse by +74\\% in perplexity compared to random selection under the same data budget, while reducing rare n-gram density by 47\\%.\n    \\item We isolate the failure mechanism to internal embeddings specifically: all non-internal methods---random selection, frozen external embeddings, and no selection---avoid catastrophic degradation, confirming that the failure arises from coupling selection to co-degrading representations rather than from the selection algorithm or data budget.\n    \\item We show that perplexity convergence masks statistically significant differences in lexical diversity among non-catastrophic methods (ANOVA $p = 0.007$), cautioning against perplexity as the sole metric for evaluating iterative training quality.\n\\end{enumerate}\n",

We run 8 self-training generations (Generation~0 through~7). At each generation, the current model generates 500K tokens via nucleus sampling (temperature~$0.8$, top-$p$~$0.95$) conditioned on WikiText-103 prefix prompts, a data selection method curates a subset, and the model is fine-tuned on the result.\n\nWe compare four data selection methods spanning a factorial ablation design:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item \\textbf{RGDS} (50\\%): diversity selection using the training model's own last-hidden-layer embeddings.\n    \\item \\textbf{External-only} (50\\%): the same selection algorithm and budget, using frozen Contriever \\citep{izacard2022unsupervised} embeddings that are never updated during training.\n    \\item \\textbf{Random 50\\%}: uniform random selection with the same data budget.\n    \\item \\textbf{Uncurated} (100\\%): all generated data retained without selection.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nAll experiments use 3 random seeds (42, 123, 456). Within each seed, all methods start from the same pretrained checkpoint and share the same Generation~0 data pool. For External-only and RGDS, two of three seeds are complete at time of writing.\n\n\\subsection{Training Details}\n\nEach generation fine-tunes from the previous generation's checkpoint using AdamW with learning rate $5 \\times 10^{-5}$ and linear warmup, batch size~4 with gradient accumulation over 8~steps (effective batch size~32), maximum sequence length~512, and 3~epochs per generation. Generation~0 starts from the HuggingFace pretrained GPT2-125M checkpoint.\n\n\\subsection{Selection Algorithm}\n\nBoth RGDS and External-only apply the same greedy selection procedure. Embeddings (768-dimensional for both GPT2 and Contriever) are projected to 32 dimensions via PCA fitted on the WikiText-103 training set. The algorithm iteratively selects the candidate whose inclusion most reduces the normalized eigenvalue variance of the selected subset's covariance matrix:\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\mathcal{L}(S) = \\frac{\\lVert \\mathbf{C}(S) \\rVert_F}{\\operatorname{tr}(\\mathbf{C}(S))^2}\n\\label{eq:selection_objective}\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $\\mathbf{C}(S)$ is the covariance of the selected set. This objective favors subsets with uniform eigenvalues, selecting for maximal dimensional coverage in the projected embedding space. Unlike facility location objectives that maximize minimum pairwise distance between selected points, eigenvalue variance minimization operates on the spectral properties of the entire subset, promoting distributional coverage rather than point-wise separation.\n\nThe two methods differ only in embedding source: RGDS uses the current-generation model's last-hidden-layer representations, which co-evolve with training; External-only uses a frozen Contriever encoder.\n\n\\subsection{Evaluation Metrics}\n\nWe evaluate each method at every generation along six dimensions:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item \\textbf{Perplexity (PPL)}: language modeling quality on the WikiText-103 validation set.\n    \\item \\textbf{Selection ratio} ($\\text{SR}_g$): ratio of mean rare trigram density in the selected subset to that in the full generated pool, quantifying alignment between the selection criterion and content diversity.\n    \\item \\textbf{Rare token ratio}: proportion of generated trigrams at or below the 10th percentile of the WikiText-103 trigram frequency distribution, measuring lexical tail preservation.\n    \\item \\textbf{RankMe}: effective embedding rank via singular value entropy \\citep{garrido2023rankme}, tracking representation dimensionality.\n    \\item \\textbf{$k$-NN probe accuracy}: $k$-nearest-neighbor classification accuracy over embeddings, tracking discriminative structure preservation.\n    \\item \\textbf{Rank correlation}: Spearman correlation between per-sample embedding diversity scores and rare token content, measuring sample-level alignment between the selection criterion and content diversity.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nGeneration~7 summary statistics appear in Table~\\ref{tab:gen7_summary}; per-generation perplexity trajectories are plotted in Figure~\\ref{fig:ppl_trends}.\n\n\\subsection{Scaling Experiment: GPT2-Medium}\n\\label{sec:scaling}\n\nTo assess whether the embedding alignment gap generalizes beyond 125M parameters, we replicate the full experimental protocol with GPT2-Medium (355M parameters), using identical training configuration, data selection methods, and evaluation metrics.

        "content": "\\section{Methodology}\n\nWe design a controlled iterative self-training experiment to isolate how embedding-based diversity selection interacts with model collapse. The experiment holds the training protocol, data budget, and selection algorithm constant while varying only the source of embeddings used for data selection, enabling direct attribution of observed differences to the embedding alignment gap.\n\n\\subsection{Base Model and Dataset}\n\nWe use GPT2-125M (124M parameters) as our base model, loaded from the HuggingFace pretrained checkpoint. We train and evaluate on WikiText-103, which contains 232,588 training samples of long-form Wikipedia articles.\n\nWe choose GPT2-125M for two reasons. First, its modest size permits running full self-training pipelines across multiple generations, data selection methods, and random seeds---a combinatorial design that would be prohibitively expensive with larger models. Second, despite its size, GPT2-125M exhibits the representation learning dynamics characteristic of transformer architectures, including the embedding drift and dimensional collapse phenomena central to our analysis \\citep{jing2022understanding}.\n\n\\subsection{Self-Training Protocol}\n\nWe implement iterative self-training in a student-as-generator loop: at each generation, the current model generates synthetic text, a data selection method curates a subset, and the model is fine-tuned on that subset to produce the next-generation model.\n\nWe run 8 generations (Generation 0 through 7), all starting from the same pretrained GPT2-125M checkpoint. Each generation proceeds as follows: (1)~the model generates 500K tokens via nucleus sampling (temperature $0.8$, top-$p$ $0.95$), conditioned on prefix prompts drawn from WikiText-103; (2)~a data selection method selects a subset (or, for Uncurated, retains all data); (3)~the model is fine-tuned on the selected data starting from the previous generation's checkpoint (cumulative fine-tuning). Generation~0 uses the pretrained checkpoint as its starting point; methods diverge from Generation~0 onward because each applies its own selection criterion to the same generated pool.\n\nAll generations share identical training hyperparameters: learning rate $5 \\times 10^{-5}$ with linear warmup, batch size 4 with gradient accumulation over 8 steps (effective batch size 32), maximum sequence length 512, and 3 training epochs per generation.\n\n\\subsection{Data Selection Methods}\n\nWe compare four data selection methods designed as a controlled set of ablations. Three methods select 50\\% of the generated data; the fourth uses all of it.\n\n\\paragraph{Uncurated (100\\%).} All generated data is used without any selection. This baseline captures the natural trajectory of model collapse under iterative self-training \\citep{shumailov2024ai, alemohammad2024self}.\n\n\\paragraph{RGDS (50\\%).} Representation-Guided Diversity Selection uses the training model's own last-hidden-layer embeddings to select a maximally diverse data subset. We first project the 768-dimensional embeddings to 32 dimensions via PCA fitted on the WikiText-103 reference set, reducing computational cost and removing noisy dimensions. We then apply a greedy selection algorithm that minimizes the \\emph{normalized eigenvalue variance} of the selected set's covariance matrix, $\\lVert \\mathbf{C}(S) \\rVert_F / \\operatorname{tr}(\\mathbf{C}(S))^2$, which favors subsets whose embedding covariance has uniform eigenvalues---i.e., maximal dimensional coverage. At each step, the candidate whose inclusion most reduces this objective is added to the selected set. The core assumption is that diversity in the model's embedding space reflects diversity in content.\n\n\\paragraph{External-only (50\\%).} This method applies the same greedy diversity selection algorithm and PCA projection but uses embeddings from a frozen Contriever encoder \\citep{izacard2022unsupervised} instead of the training model's own embeddings. Contriever's parameters are fixed throughout all generations and are never updated during self-training. This isolates a single variable: by holding the selection algorithm constant, any performance difference between RGDS and External-only is attributable to whether the embedding space co-evolves with the model.\n\n\\paragraph{Random 50\\%.} Samples are selected uniformly at random to fill the 50\\% budget. This provides the cleanest ablation for disentangling selection quality from data budget effects.\n\n\\paragraph{Controlled comparisons.} The four methods yield a factorial ablation structure:\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item \\textbf{RGDS vs.\\ Random 50\\%}: identical data budget; differences arise solely from selection mechanism quality.\n    \\item \\textbf{RGDS vs.\\ External-only}: identical budget and algorithm; differences arise from the embedding source (drifting internal vs.\\ frozen external).\n    \\item \\textbf{Random 50\\% vs.\\ Uncurated}: isolates the effect of data budget (50\\% vs.\\ 100\\%) without any intelligent selection.\n    \\item \\textbf{External-only vs.\\ Random 50\\%}: quantifies the gain of embedding-guided selection when embeddings are stable.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\subsection{Selection Ratio}\n\nTo diagnose \\emph{what} each selection method preferentially retains, we define the selection ratio, a per-generation metric that measures whether the selected subset is enriched or depleted in content diversity relative to the full generated pool:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\text{SR}_g = \\frac{\\bar{r}(\\mathcal{S}_g)}{\\bar{r}(\\mathcal{D}_g)}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\noindent where $\\bar{r}(\\mathcal{S}_g)$ is the mean rare n-gram density of the selected subset $\\mathcal{S}_g$ at generation $g$, and $\\bar{r}(\\mathcal{D}_g)$ is the mean rare n-gram density of the full generated pool $\\mathcal{D}_g$. We define a rare n-gram as any trigram whose count falls at or below the 10th percentile of the trigram frequency distribution in the WikiText-103 training set, yielding a data-adaptive threshold.\n\nThe selection ratio admits a direct interpretation:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $\\text{SR} > 1$: the method preferentially retains samples rich in rare n-grams, aligning selection with content diversity.\n    \\item $\\text{SR} < 1$: the method preferentially retains samples poor in rare n-grams, anti-aligning selection with content diversity.\n    \\item $\\text{SR} \\approx 1$: selection is uncorrelated with content diversity (the expected value under uniform random selection).\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\noindent Tracking $\\text{SR}_g$ across generations reveals whether a selection method's relationship to content diversity is stable or shifts as the model degrades.\n\n\\subsection{Evaluation Metrics}\n\nWe evaluate each method at every generation along two axes: language modeling quality and diversity.\n\n\\paragraph{Language modeling quality.} We report perplexity (PPL) on the WikiText-103 validation set.\n\n\\paragraph{Lexical diversity.} We measure the rare n-gram ratio---the proportion of trigrams in generated text that qualify as rare under the definition above.\n\n\\paragraph{Representation quality.} We track three embedding-space diagnostics. RankMe measures the effective rank of the embedding matrix via singular value entropy \\citep{garrido2023rankme}: a higher RankMe indicates more uniform utilization of embedding dimensions. The $k$-NN probe accuracy measures how well embeddings separate content categories via $k$-nearest-neighbor classification: declining accuracy signals loss of discriminative structure. The Spearman rank correlation between per-sample embedding diversity scores and rare token content quantifies sample-level alignment between the selection criterion and content diversity.\n\n\\subsection{Reproducibility}\n\nAll experiments are repeated across 3 random seeds (42, 123, 456). Each seed determines the random initialization of fine-tuning, the sampling randomness during generation, and (for Random 50\\%) the subset selection. All methods within a given seed start from the same pretrained checkpoint and, at Generation~0, the same generated data pool, so that observed differences are attributable to the selection method alone. We report means and standard deviations across seeds.",

Let me continue from where I left off. The immediate task is to create Table 1 (tab:gen7_summary) in results.tex. I have all the computed data ready. Let me insert it after line 4 in results.tex.

I also need to:
1. Create the table in results.tex
2. Spawn a Worker to extract rgds_seed456 metrics
3. Report GPU status to Director

Let me first read the current state of results.tex to make sure I have the latest version, then insert the table.

Figure~\\ref{fig:ppl_trends} shows per-generation perplexity trajectories. We organize findings around three primary claims and one directional observation.\n\n\\subsection{RGDS Produces Catastrophic Perplexity Degradation}\n\\label{sec:result_c1}\n\nRGDS is the only method that exhibits catastrophic performance degradation across generations. At Generation~7, RGDS reaches a perplexity of $78.32 \\pm 4.60$ ($n{=}2$\\textsuperscript{$\\dagger$}), compared to $47.04 \\pm 2.90$ for Uncurated ($n{=}3$; +66\\%) and $43.18 \\pm 1.43$ for Random~50\\% ($n{=}3$; +82\\%). Both completed seeds show the same pattern: 75.07 (seed=42) and 81.57 (seed=123), with effect sizes that exceed inter-seed variance within any other method by an order of magnitude.\n\nThe selection ratio traces the mechanism behind this degradation. RGDS's selection ratio follows an overall declining trend from ${\\sim}1.04$ at Generation~0 to $0.52 \\pm 0.004$ at Generation~7, with a transient rebound during Generations~1--3 ($0.91 \\to 0.93 \\to 0.94$) before sustained decline from Generation~4 onward. By the final generation, RGDS preferentially retains vocabulary-poor samples: its selected subsets contain approximately half the rare trigram density of the full generated pool. The model's internal notion of ``diverse'' has inverted relative to content diversity.\n\n% TODO: seed=456 RGDS 完成后更新为 n=3 mean±std 并补充统计检验 p 值\n\n\\subsection{External Embeddings Avoid the Alignment Gap}\n\\label{sec:result_c2}\n\nExternal-only selection applies the identical selection algorithm and 50\\% data budget but uses frozen Contriever embeddings. It avoids catastrophic degradation entirely: its Generation~7 perplexity of $47.59 \\pm 2.93$ ($n{=}2$\\textsuperscript{$\\dagger$}) falls within the range of Uncurated ($47.04 \\pm 2.90$) and Random~50\\% ($43.18 \\pm 1.43$).\n\nExternal-only maintains a selection ratio above~1.0 throughout all generations ($1.11 \\pm 0.02$ at Generation~7), indicating continued preferential retention of content-diverse samples. Its rank correlation between diversity scores and rare token content remains weakly positive ($+0.011 \\pm 0.000$; Table~\\ref{tab:gen7_summary}), while RGDS's correlation turns negative ($-0.035 \\pm 0.005$).\n\nSince RGDS and External-only differ in exactly one variable---the embedding source---the 30.7-point perplexity gap at Generation~7 ($78.32$ vs.\\ $47.59$) is directly attributable to the use of co-degrading internal representations. The selection algorithm is not at fault; the failure is specific to coupling data selection to embeddings that co-evolve with the collapsing model.\n\nNotably, External-only does not significantly outperform Random~50\\% in perplexity ($46.36 \\pm 2.97$ vs.\\ $43.18 \\pm 1.43$; $p = 0.171$, two-sided $t$-test, $n{=}3$). Despite maintaining a selection ratio above~1.0, the ``intelligent'' diversity signal from frozen external embeddings provides no measurable advantage over uninformed random subsampling. This null result reinforces the practical implication discussed in \\S\\ref{sec:discussion}: random sampling is a zero-cost alternative that matches the performance of embedding-guided selection when embeddings are stable and avoids the catastrophic failure when they are not.\n\n% TODO: seed=456 ext/rgds 完成后更新为 n=3 mean±std 并补充 RGDS vs External t 检验\n\n\\subsection{Internal Selection Underperforms Random Baseline}\n\\label{sec:result_c3}\n\nThe comparison between RGDS and Random~50\\% provides the cleanest controlled ablation: both use the same 50\\% data budget, isolating the effect of the selection mechanism itself. RGDS's Generation~7 perplexity ($78.32 \\pm 4.60$, $n{=}2$\\textsuperscript{$\\dagger$}) exceeds Random~50\\% ($43.18 \\pm 1.43$, $n{=}3$) by 82\\%. Internal embedding diversity selection does not merely fail to improve upon random sampling---it actively degrades model quality relative to uninformed selection.\n\nRare token ratio confirms this finding: RGDS retains $0.0057 \\pm 0.0008$ at Generation~7, compared to $0.0098 \\pm 0.0003$ for Random~50\\%---a 42\\% reduction in lexical tail content.\n\n\\subsection{Random Pruning: A Directional Observation}\n\\label{sec:result_s3}\n\nRandom~50\\% ($43.18 \\pm 1.43$, $n{=}3$) achieves lower Generation~7 perplexity than Uncurated ($47.04 \\pm 2.90$, $n{=}3$), a reduction of 8.2\\%. The direction is consistent across all three seeds. However, this difference does not reach conventional significance ($p \\approx 0.10$, two-sided $t$-test), and we report it as a directional observation rather than a confirmed finding.\n\nIf confirmed with additional statistical power, this result would suggest that training on a random 50\\% subset provides mild regularization compared to using all generated data in the iterative self-training setting, consistent with observations that data pruning can improve generalization even without informed selection \\citep{sorscher2022beyond}.\n\nWhile the perplexity difference remains directional, Random~50\\% shows a statistically significant advantage in lexical diversity: its Generation~7 rare n-gram ratio ($0.0098 \\pm 0.0003$) exceeds Uncurated ($0.0090 \\pm 0.0004$) with $p = 0.025$ (two-sided $t$-test, $n{=}3$). Even uninformed subsampling preserves content diversity better than retaining all generated data, suggesting that the diversity benefit of curation does not require intelligent selection---merely reducing the volume of self-generated training data slows lexical tail erosion.\n\n\\subsection{Lexical Diversity Collapse Across Methods}\n\\label{sec:result_diversity}\n\nRGDS exhibits the sharpest decline in rare token ratio, dropping from approximately 0.010 at Generation~0 to $0.0057 \\pm 0.0008$ at Generation~7 (Table~\\ref{tab:gen7_summary}). The remaining methods converge to a narrower band: Random~50\\% ($0.0098 \\pm 0.0003$), Uncurated ($0.0090 \\pm 0.0004$), and External-only ($0.0102 \\pm 0.0004$). Relative to the WikiText-103 baseline rare token ratio of approximately 0.029, all non-RGDS methods exhibit roughly 65\\% lexical tail erosion by Generation~7; RGDS reaches approximately 80\\%.\n\nUnlike the perplexity-level normal cluster (ANOVA $p = 0.219$; \\S\\ref{sec:result_c1}), the rare n-gram differences among non-RGDS methods are statistically significant (ANOVA $p = 0.007$, $n{=}3$ per method). In particular, Uncurated retains significantly fewer rare n-grams than Random~50\\% ($p = 0.025$, two-sided $t$-test). Lexical diversity collapse is primarily driven by the iterative self-training loop itself \\citep{shumailov2024ai}, but the degree of erosion is modulated by data selection: even uninformed curation (random subsampling) provides measurable protection relative to using all generated data. RGDS is distinctive in accelerating this inherent degradation far beyond all other methods.\n\n\\subsection{Representation Metrics Do Not Track Content Collapse}\n\\label{sec:result_rankme}\n\nRankMe values at Generation~7 are comparable across all methods (289--296; Table~\\ref{tab:gen7_summary}), with RGDS showing a slightly elevated value ($295.54 \\pm 3.98$) relative to the other methods (${\\sim}290$). The metric designed to track effective embedding dimensionality does not distinguish between catastrophically degraded RGDS and the normally performing alternatives, indicating that embedding structural properties can persist even as the space loses content-discriminative fidelity.\n\n\\subsection{Scaling to GPT2-Medium (355M)}\n\\label{sec:result_scaling}\n\nPreliminary results from GPT2-Medium (355M) confirm that model collapse generalizes to larger models and is substantially amplified (Table~\\ref{tab:medium_uncurated}). The Uncurated baseline perplexity increases by 245\\% over 8 generations (26.55 to 91.66, seed=42, $n{=}1$), compared to 28\\% for GPT2-125M (36.7 to 47.04, $n{=}3$). RankMe inflation increases by $+$72.4 points (vs.\\ $+$11.1 for GPT2-125M), and the rank correlation between embedding diversity scores and rare token content turns negative at Generation~4, following the same trajectory observed in the smaller model.\n\nThe amplified baseline degradation at 355M parameters suggests that the embedding alignment gap may produce even more severe outcomes when RGDS is applied at this scale: if the Uncurated floor itself is worse, the additional degradation introduced by co-degrading internal embeddings could compound further. \\placeholder{GPT2-Medium RGDS Generation~7 perplexity and selection ratio to confirm or disconfirm this prediction.}\n\n% TODO: GPT2-medium RGDS/External/Random 完成后补充完整 4-method 对比和统计检验\n",

_source line 588 · 2026-05-13T23:21:07.245Z_

This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The summary below covers the earlier portion of the conversation.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user (Director) is managing an ML research paper submission for EMNLP 2026 ARR (deadline May 25, 2026). The project "div_cal_verify" studies the "Embedding Alignment Gap" — how diversity-based data selection using a model's own embeddings accelerates model collapse in iterative self-training. The agent serves as the execution coordinator, managing GPU experiments, spawning Workers, and maintaining paper consistency. The session involved: confirming experiment completions, computing multi-seed statistics, writing/editing paper sections, fixing numerous consistency issues identified by a Reviewer, and compiling the paper. The most recent instruction requires a comprehensive update now that rgds_seed456 has completed, including recalculating all 3-seed RGDS statistics, replacing old 2-seed values throughout all .tex files, and adding discussion of seed=456's ratio rebound behavior.

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - **Embedding Alignment Gap**: Progressive divergence between model's internal embedding diversity and actual content diversity during iterative self-training
   - **Selection Ratio (SR)**: Mean rare n-gram density of selected subset / full generated pool. SR>1 = good alignment, SR<1 = anti-alignment
   - **RGDS**: Representation-Guided Diversity Selection using model's own embeddings — catastrophically accelerates collapse
   - **Normal Cluster**: Random 50%, External-only, and Uncurated methods cluster in PPL 43-47 (ANOVA p=0.219), but show significant differences in rare n-gram (ANOVA p=0.007)
   - **Four methods**: RGDS 50%, External-only 50% (frozen Contriever), Random 50%, Uncurated 100%
   - **GPT2-125M and GPT2-medium (355M)** on WikiText-103, 8 generations, 3 seeds (42, 123, 456)
   - **Goodhart's Law framing**: Internal embeddings as proxy that inverts relative to true objective
   - **Key stats**: RGDS ~80% higher PPL than Random baseline; ratio declines ~1.04→~0.52; standard metrics (RankMe, k-NN) remain stable during collapse

3. Files and Code Sections:

   - **`docs/paper/main.tex`** (main compilation entry point)
     - Abstract written by Worker (~245 words), covers problem→finding→mechanism→evidence→contribution
     - `\input{conclusion}` uncommented
     - `\usepackage{inconsolata}` removed (package not installed)
     - "GPT-2" → "GPT2" in abstract
     - Current state includes all 8 section inputs in correct ACL/EMNLP order
     ```latex
     \input{introduction}
     \input{related_work}
     \input{methodology}
     \input{experiments}
     \input{results}
     \input{discussion}
     \input{conclusion}
     \bibliography{references}
     ```

   - **`docs/paper/experiments.tex`** (training details + evaluation metrics)
     - L20 grad_accum fixed: "gradient accumulation over 8~steps (effective batch size~32)"
     - L72 uncurated baseline: "1.28$\times$ for GPT2-125M (36.7 to 47.04, $n{=}3$)"
     - §4.4 metric list expanded to 6 items (added k-NN probe accuracy)
     - **Missing**: `tab:gen7_summary` table — Director requested it be created but not yet done
     - **Missing**: `fig:ppl_trends` figure — waiting for rgds_seed456 data

   - **`docs/paper/methodology.tex`**
     - §3.5 Distinct-n and Self-BLEU definitions deleted
     - Rank correlation added to Representation quality paragraph ("three embedding-space diagnostics")
     - L17 confirmed: "gradient accumulation over 8 steps (effective batch size 32)"

   - **`docs/paper/results.tex`**
     - L47: `\ref{sec:result_cluster}` → `\ref{sec:result_c1}` (broken cross-ref fix)
     - §5.4 added rare n-gram statistical significance paragraph (Random vs Uncurated p=0.025)
     - §5.5 replaced narrative with ANOVA p=0.007 data, noting PPL cluster ≠ rare n-gram cluster
     - §5.2 added External vs Random null result paragraph (p=0.171)
     - L55: uncurated baseline corrected to "28% for GPT2-125M (36.7 to 47.04, n=3)"
     - **Still contains 2-seed RGDS values** (78.32±4.60, n=2) — needs update to 3-seed

   - **`docs/paper/introduction.tex`**
     - L9: Added "(seed=42)" to rare n-gram -47% comparison
     - L27: Added 4th contribution about ANOVA p=0.007 / PPL masking lexical diversity differences
     - Contains TODO comments for 3-seed updates (L8, L10, L15, L19)
     - **Still contains seed=42 numbers** (+74%, 0.0051 vs 0.0096) — pending 3-seed update

   - **`docs/paper/discussion.tex`**
     - L10: "Generations~0--2" → "Generations~1--3" for ratio rebound period
     - §6.2: Added PPL-specific qualification (ANOVA p=0.219) and rare n-gram caveat paragraph (ANOVA p=0.007)
     - §6.5 Limitations and §6.6 Future Work exist and are complete
     - **Needs update**: seed=456 ratio rebound discussion paragraph (Director's latest request)

   - **`docs/paper/conclusion.tex`** (created by Worker, ~370 words)
     - Three principal findings + limitations reference + practical implication
     - Uses approximate values (~80%, ~1.04→~0.52) — needs 3-seed precision update

   - **`docs/paper/related_work.tex`** (complete, 36 references, 4 subsections)
     - No changes needed

   - **`docs/paper/references.bib`** — exists, bibtex compiles successfully
     - Missing `goodhart1984problems` entry (used in artifacts version but not docs version)

   - **`artifacts/_project/paper/experiments.tex`** (Worker-produced draft, NOT compiled by main.tex)
     - External row filled with seed456 data
     - External ratio stability paragraph updated
     - **This is a separate version from docs/paper/** — Reviewer confusion source
     - Still has RGDS placeholders and some 2-seed values

4. Errors and Fixes:
   - **inconsolata.sty not found**: Compilation failed. Fixed by removing `\usepackage{inconsolata}` from main.tex.
   - **edit_paper_section tool failures**: The MCP tool couldn't find text with whitespace-normalized matching. Fixed by using direct Edit tool on the actual .tex files instead.
   - **File modified since read errors**: Multiple Edit attempts failed because files were concurrently modified (by system/linter/other Workers). Fixed by re-reading files before each edit.
   - **Reviewer repeatedly reporting grad_accum unfixed**: Likely because Reviewer was checking `artifacts/_project/paper/experiments.tex` (old Worker draft) instead of `docs/paper/experiments.tex` (main version). The docs/paper version was correctly fixed. Reported this hypothesis to Director.
   - **Duplicate Director instructions**: Items 1-7 were sent twice. Verified all were already fixed and reported grep confirmation.
   - **Broken cross-reference `\ref{sec:result_cluster}`**: Label didn't exist in any file. Fixed by changing to `\ref{sec:result_c1}`.
   - **Two paper versions causing confusion**: `docs/paper/` is the main version (compiled by main.tex), `artifacts/_project/paper/` is a Worker-produced draft. Edits need to go to docs/paper/.

5. Problem Solving:
   - Successfully computed 3-seed statistics for External_only, Uncurated, and Random 50% methods
   - Systematically addressed 7 Reviewer consistency issues in one pass
   - Resolved the two-version paper confusion (docs/ vs artifacts/)
   - Full LaTeX compilation achieved: 13 pages, 0 errors, only missing table/figure references remain
   - GPU chain automation working correctly: rgds_seed456 completed → medium_external auto-started on cuda:1
   - medium_rgds_seed42 progressed to Gen 5/7 on cuda:0

6. All User Messages:
   - `[Director 指令] ext_seed456 完成确认（Reviewer 已核实数据）。GPU util=0% 排查取消...立即执行：ext_seed456 registry → DONE，记录 Gen 7 指标...计算 3-seed External 统计量...继续监控 cuda:0/cuda:1`

   - `[Director 指令] rgds_seed456 完成，3-seed RGDS 数据就位。立即执行：1. 精确重算 2. 论文全局数字替换 3. Ratio 叙事调整 4. seed=456 ratio 反弹讨论` (MOST RECENT — marked CRITICAL: TEXT ONLY)
   - Multiple "Continue from where you left off." messages

7. Pending Tasks:
   - **[HIGHEST PRIORITY] rgds_seed456 3-seed update**: Extract seed456 RGDS metrics from server log, update registry, compute 3-seed RGDS statistics (PPL mean±std, ratio mean±std, rare mean±std), run all pairwise t-tests, update all .tex files with precise 3-seed values
   - **Create `tab:gen7_summary` (Table 1)**: Still not created — Director explicitly requested this. Should go in results.tex with columns: Method | Gen 0 PPL | Gen 7 PPL | Δ% | SR | Rare | RankMe | n
   - **Global number replacement in all .tex**: Replace 2-seed RGDS values (78.32, +82%, 0.52, 4.60 std) with 3-seed values throughout Abstract, Introduction, Results, Discussion, Conclusion
   - **Ratio narrative adjustment**: Update "1.04→0.52" to new 3-seed mean±std; note inter-seed variance (seed456 shows ratio rebound to 0.868)
   - **seed=456 ratio rebound discussion**: Add paragraph in Discussion about gen6=0.645→gen7=0.868 rebound without PPL improvement
   - **Register medium_external experiment**: Auto-started on cuda:1 after rgds_seed456 completed, needs registry entry
   - **Generate `fig:ppl_trends`**: PPL trajectory figure (waiting until rgds_seed456 data is in)
   - **Monitor running experiments**: medium_rgds_seed42 (cuda:0, Gen 5/7), medium_external (cuda:1, just started)

8. Current Work:
   The most recent Director instruction arrived with "CRITICAL: Respond with TEXT ONLY" — requiring a summary rather than tool execution. Before this summary request, I was working on two parallel tracks:
   
   **Track A**: Creating `tab:gen7_summary` (Table 1) — Director instructed to create this table in results.tex with current data. I had read all registry data and was about to draft the LaTeX table when the next Director instruction arrived.
   
   **Track B**: The final Director instruction (rgds_seed456 complete) requires a 4-part comprehensive update:
   1. Precise 3-seed RGDS recalculation (all stats + t-tests + ANOVA + Cohen's d)
   2. Global .tex number replacement (78.32→new mean, +82%→new%, ratio values)
   3. Ratio narrative adjustment (acknowledge inter-seed variance, seed456 rebound)
   4. Discussion paragraph about seed=456 ratio rebound (0.645→0.868 at gen7 but PPL still 66.22)
   
   **Key missing data**: rgds_seed456 Gen 7 metrics are NOT YET in the registry. The Worker reported the experiment completed on the server, but no one has extracted the actual metric values from the log file. A Worker needs to SSH to westd-11235 and parse `/root/autodl-tmp/div_cal_verify/rgds_seed456.log` to get gen7_ppl, gen7_ratio, gen7_rare, gen7_rankme, gen7_corr values, then update_registry.

   **Available RGDS data from registry**:
   - seed42: gen7_ppl=75.07, gen7_ratio=0.5173, gen7_rare=0.0051, gen7_rankme=292.72, gen7_corr=-0.0387
   - seed123: gen7_ppl=81.57, gen7_ratio=0.5236, gen7_rare=0.0062, gen7_rankme=298.35, gen7_corr=-0.0312
   - seed456: NOT IN REGISTRY YET (Director mentions PPL=66.22, ratio=0.868 in instruction text)

9. Optional Next Step:
   Based on the Director's most recent instruction: "rgds_seed456 完成，3-seed RGDS 数据就位。立即执行以下更新（按顺序）：1. 精确重算（最高优先级）..."
   
   The immediate next steps are:
   1. Spawn a Worker to SSH to westd-11235 and extract rgds_seed456 full Gen 0-7 metrics from the log file, then update_registry with conclusion=success and all metrics
   2. Using the Director-provided seed456 values (PPL=66.22, ratio=0.868) plus registry seed42/seed123 data, compute 3-seed RGDS statistics:
      - PPL mean = (75.07+81.57+66.22)/3 = 74.29, std ≈ 7.7
      - ratio mean = (0.5173+0.5236+0.868)/3 = 0.636, std ≈ 0.20
   3. Run pairwise t-tests (RGDS vs Random/External/Uncurated) and ANOVA
   4. Create `tab:gen7_summary` Table 1 in results.tex with complete 3-seed data
   5. Global grep-and-replace of old 2-seed values across all .tex files
   6. Add ratio rebound discussion paragraph to discussion.tex

A natural mitigation is diversity-based data curation: selecting training subsets that maximize coverage in the model's own embedding space. We show that this intuitive strategy backfires. In controlled iterative self-training experiments with GPT2 (125M and 355M parameters) on WikiText-103, Representation-Guided Diversity Selection (RGDS)---which uses the training model's embeddings to greedily maximize diversity---\\emph{accelerates} collapse rather than preventing it, producing roughly 80\\% higher perplexity than a random selection baseline operating under the same 50\\% data budget. We identify the mechanism behind this failure as the \\emph{Embedding Alignment Gap}: the model's internal notion of ``diversity'' progressively diverges from actual content diversity as its representations co-degrade with the generated data, causing the selection ratio to decline from approximately 1.0 to 0.5 over eight generations. Critically, all selection strategies that bypass the model's own embeddings---random sampling (PPL 43.18$\\pm$1.43), external frozen embeddings (PPL 46.36$\\pm$2.97), and uncurated full-corpus training (PPL 47.04$\\pm$2.90)---cluster within a narrow perplexity range with no catastrophic failure. Meanwhile, standard representation quality diagnostics such as RankMe effective dimensionality and $k$-NN accuracy remain stable throughout training, rendering the alignment gap invisible to conventional monitoring. Our results demonstrate that coupling data selection to co-degrading internal representations creates a feedback loop that amplifies rather than mitigates collapse, and that zero-cost random sampling is a more robust alternative for iterative self-training pipelines.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\input{introduction}\n\n\\input{related_work}\n\n\\input{methodology}\n\n\\input{experiments}\n\n\\input{results}\n\n\\input{discussion}\n\n\\input{conclusion}\n\n\\bibliography{references}\n\n\\end{document}\n",

At Generation~7, RGDS reaches a perplexity of $78.32 \\pm 4.60$ ($n{=}2$\\textsuperscript{$\\dagger$}), compared to $47.04 \\pm 2.90$ for Uncurated ($n{=}3$; +66\\%) and $43.18 \\pm 1.43$ for Random~50\\% ($n{=}3$; +82\\%). Both completed seeds show the same pattern: 75.07 (seed=42) and 81.57 (seed=123), with effect sizes that exceed inter-seed variance within any other method by an order of magnitude.\n\nThe selection ratio traces the mechanism behind this degradation. RGDS's selection ratio follows an overall declining trend from ${\\sim}1.04$ at Generation~0 to $0.52 \\pm 0.004$ at Generation~7, with a transient rebound during Generations~1--3 ($0.91 \\to 0.93 \\to 0.94$) before sustained decline from Generation~4 onward. By the final generation, RGDS preferentially retains vocabulary-poor samples: its selected subsets contain approximately half the rare trigram density of the full generated pool. The model's internal notion of ``diverse'' has inverted relative to content diversity.\n\n% TODO: seed=456 RGDS 完成后更新为 n=3 mean±std 并补充统计检验 p 值\n\n\\subsection{External Embeddings Avoid the Alignment Gap}\n\\label{sec:result_c2}\n\nExternal-only selection applies the identical selection algorithm and 50\\% data budget but uses frozen Contriever embeddings. It avoids catastrophic degradation entirely: its Generation~7 perplexity of $47.59 \\pm 2.93$ ($n{=}2$\\textsuperscript{$\\dagger$}) falls within the range of Uncurated ($47.04 \\pm 2.90$) and Random~50\\% ($43.18 \\pm 1.43$).\n\nExternal-only maintains a selection ratio above~1.0 throughout all generations ($1.11 \\pm 0.02$ at Generation~7), indicating continued preferential retention of content-diverse samples. Its rank correlation between diversity scores and rare token content remains weakly positive ($+0.011 \\pm 0.000$; Table~\\ref{tab:gen7_summary}), while RGDS's correlation turns negative ($-0.035 \\pm 0.005$).\n\nSince RGDS and External-only differ in exactly one variable---the embedding source---the 30.7-point perplexity gap at Generation~7 ($78.32$ vs.\\ $47.59$) is directly attributable to the use of co-degrading internal representations. The selection algorithm is not at fault; the failure is specific to coupling data selection to embeddings that co-evolve with the collapsing model.\n\nNotably, External-only does not significantly outperform Random~50\\% in perplexity ($46.36 \\pm 2.97$ vs.\\ $43.18 \\pm 1.43$; $p = 0.171$, two-sided $t$-test, $n{=}3$). Despite maintaining a selection ratio above~1.0, the ``intelligent'' diversity signal from frozen external embeddings provides no measurable advantage over uninformed random subsampling. This null result reinforces the practical implication discussed in \\S\\ref{sec:discussion}: random sampling is a zero-cost alternative that matches the performance of embedding-guided selection when embeddings are stable and avoids the catastrophic failure when they are not.\n\n% TODO: seed=456 ext/rgds 完成后更新为 n=3 mean±std 并补充 RGDS vs External t 检验\n\n\\subsection{Internal Selection Underperforms Random Baseline}\n\\label{sec:result_c3}\n\nThe comparison between RGDS and Random~50\\% provides the cleanest controlled ablation: both use the same 50\\% data budget, isolating the effect of the selection mechanism itself. RGDS's Generation~7 perplexity ($78.32 \\pm 4.60$, $n{=}2$\\textsuperscript{$\\dagger$}) exceeds Random~50\\% ($43.18 \\pm 1.43$, $n{=}3$) by 82\\%. Internal embedding diversity selection does not merely fail to improve upon random sampling---it actively degrades model quality relative to uninformed selection.\n\nRare token ratio confirms this finding: RGDS retains $0.0057 \\pm 0.0008$ at Generation~7, compared to $0.0098 \\pm 0.0003$ for Random~50\\%---a 42\\% reduction in lexical tail content.\n\n\\subsection{Random Pruning: A Directional Observation}\n\\label{sec:result_s3}\n\nRandom~50\\% ($43.18 \\pm 1.43$, $n{=}3$) achieves lower Generation~7 perplexity than Uncurated ($47.04 \\pm 2.90$, $n{=}3$), a reduction of 8.2\\%. The direction is consistent across all three seeds. However, this difference does not reach conventional significance ($p \\approx 0.10$, two-sided $t$-test), and we report it as a directional observation rather than a confirmed finding.\n\nIf confirmed with additional statistical power, this result would suggest that training on a random 50\\% subset provides mild regularization compared to using all generated data in the iterative self-training setting, consistent with observations that data pruning can improve generalization even without informed selection \\citep{sorscher2022beyond}.\n\nWhile the perplexity difference remains directional, Random~50\\% shows a statistically significant advantage in lexical diversity: its Generation~7 rare n-gram ratio ($0.0098 \\pm 0.0003$) exceeds Uncurated ($0.0090 \\pm 0.0004$) with $p = 0.025$ (two-sided $t$-test, $n{=}3$). Even uninformed subsampling preserves content diversity better than retaining all generated data, suggesting that the diversity benefit of curation does not require intelligent selection---merely reducing the volume of self-generated training data slows lexical tail erosion.\n\n\\subsection{Lexical Diversity Collapse Across Methods}\n\\label{sec:result_diversity}\n\nRGDS exhibits the sharpest decline in rare token ratio, dropping from approximately 0.010 at Generation~0 to $0.0057 \\pm 0.0008$ at Generation~7 (Table~\\ref{tab:gen7_summary}). The remaining methods converge to a narrower band: Random~50\\% ($0.0098 \\pm 0.0003$), Uncurated ($0.0090 \\pm 0.0004$), and External-only ($0.0102 \\pm 0.0004$). Relative to the WikiText-103 baseline rare token ratio of approximately 0.029, all non-RGDS methods exhibit roughly 65\\% lexical tail erosion by Generation~7; RGDS reaches approximately 80\\%.\n\nUnlike the perplexity-level normal cluster (ANOVA $p = 0.219$; \\S\\ref{sec:result_c1}), the rare n-gram differences among non-RGDS methods are statistically significant (ANOVA $p = 0.007$, $n{=}3$ per method). In particular, Uncurated retains significantly fewer rare n-grams than Random~50\\% ($p = 0.025$, two-sided $t$-test). Lexical diversity collapse is primarily driven by the iterative self-training loop itself \\citep{shumailov2024ai}, but the degree of erosion is modulated by data selection: even uninformed curation (random subsampling) provides measurable protection relative to using all generated data. RGDS is distinctive in accelerating this inherent degradation far beyond all other methods.\n\n\\subsection{Representation Metrics Do Not Track Content Collapse}\n\\label{sec:result_rankme}\n\nRankMe values at Generation~7 are comparable across all methods (289--296; Table~\\ref{tab:gen7_summary}), with RGDS showing a slightly elevated value ($295.54 \\pm 3.98$) relative to the other methods (${\\sim}290$). The metric designed to track effective embedding dimensionality does not distinguish between catastrophically degraded RGDS and the normally performing alternatives, indicating that embedding structural properties can persist even as the space loses content-discriminative fidelity.\n\n\\subsection{Scaling to GPT2-Medium (355M)}\n\\label{sec:result_scaling}\n\nPreliminary results from GPT2-Medium (355M) confirm that model collapse generalizes to larger models and is substantially amplified (Table~\\ref{tab:medium_uncurated}). The Uncurated baseline perplexity increases by 245\\% over 8 generations (26.55 to 91.66, seed=42, $n{=}1$), compared to 28\\% for GPT2-125M (36.7 to 47.04, $n{=}3$). RankMe inflation increases by $+$72.4 points (vs.\\ $+$11.1 for GPT2-125M), and the rank correlation between embedding diversity scores and rare token content turns negative at Generation~4, following the same trajectory observed in the smaller model.\n\nThe amplified baseline degradation at 355M parameters suggests that the embedding alignment gap may produce even more severe outcomes when RGDS is applied at this scale: if the Uncurated floor itself is worse, the additional degradation introduced by co-degrading internal embeddings could compound further. \\placeholder{GPT2-Medium RGDS Generation~7 perplexity and selection ratio to confirm or disconfirm this prediction.}\n\n% TODO: GPT2-medium RGDS/External/Random 完成后补充完整 4-method 对比和统计检验\n",

Each generation of synthetic data carries distributional artifacts from its parent model; when these artifacts compound across iterations, the distribution's tails erode and the model converges toward a narrow, repetitive mode \\citep{seddik2024how, briesch2023large, guo2024curious}. As synthetic data becomes an increasingly prevalent component of training pipelines, understanding this feedback loop---and identifying strategies that avoid it---has become a pressing concern \\citep{dohmatob2025strong, gerstgrasser2024model}.\n\nDiversity-based data curation is a natural mitigation strategy. If model collapse arises from training on redundant or low-quality synthetic samples, then selecting a maximally diverse subset should preserve the distributional richness that iterative training erodes. Submodular maximization over embedding spaces provides a principled framework for this goal: submodular diversity objectives identify representative subsets that maximize geometric coverage of the data distribution \\citep{wei2015submodularity, mirzasoleiman2020coresets}. Embedding-based selection has demonstrated strong results in data pruning \\citep{sorscher2022beyond} and data-efficient training more broadly \\citep{xie2023data, xia2024less, engstrom2024dsdm}. When the model's own representations define the embedding space, diversity selection should---in principle---directly counteract the homogenization that drives collapse.\n\nWe test this intuition in a controlled iterative self-training experiment and find the opposite of the expected outcome. Representation-Guided Diversity Selection (RGDS)---which selects the most diverse 50\\% of synthetic data according to the training model's own last-hidden-layer embeddings---increases Generation~7 perplexity by +74\\% relative to random selection under the same 50\\% data budget (75.07 vs.\\ 43.20, seed=42).%\n%TODO(3-seed): replace seed=42 numbers with mean+-std across 3 seeds once seed=456 completes\nRare n-gram density in RGDS-selected text drops by 47\\% compared to random selection (0.0051 vs.\\ 0.0096; seed=42). The method designed to preserve diversity accelerates collapse instead. This result replicates across seeds: RGDS produces Generation~7 perplexities of 75.07 (seed=42) and 81.57 (seed=123), while all other methods---random selection, external-embedding selection, and no selection---remain between 41 and 51.%\n%TODO(3-seed): add seed=456 results and report mean+-std\n\nThe failure exposes a gap in the data selection literature. Methods such as SemDeDup \\citep{abbas2023semdedup}, D4 \\citep{tirumala2023d4}, and DSIR \\citep{xie2023data} are designed for one-shot curation of static datasets, where the model providing embeddings is fixed and its representation quality is not in question. Active learning methods account for model updates between selection rounds \\citep{ash2020deep, kirsch2019batchbald}, but they do not address the compound effect of selection bias feeding back into the selecting model's own training data across generations. The concept drift literature establishes that learned representations degrade under sustained distribution shift \\citep{lu2019learning, gama2014survey}, but no prior work examines how this degradation interacts with embedding-based data selection in a self-consuming training loop---a setting where the model that selects the data is also the model whose next generation of representations is shaped by that selection.\n\nWe identify the mechanism behind this failure as the \\emph{embedding alignment gap}: a progressive divergence between what the model's internal representations treat as ``diverse'' and what constitutes genuine content diversity. To quantify this divergence, we define the \\emph{selection ratio}---the mean rare n-gram density of the selected subset divided by that of the full generated pool. A selection ratio above~1 indicates that the method preferentially retains content-rich samples; below~1 indicates preferential retention of content-poor samples. For RGDS, the selection ratio follows an overall declining trend from 1.04 at Generation~0 to 0.52 at Generation~7 (seed=42),%\n%TODO(3-seed): update selection ratio trajectory with mean+-std across 3 seeds\nwith a transient rebound in Generations~2--4 before sustained decline. By the final generation, RGDS actively selects for vocabulary-poor samples, and its selected subsets contain 47\\% fewer rare n-grams than random selection produces. The model's internal notion of diversity has inverted relative to content diversity. This trajectory is consistent with dimensional collapse in the embedding space \\citep{jing2022understanding, hua2021feature}: as the model trains on increasingly homogeneous data, its effective representational dimensionality shrinks, formerly distinct content regions merge, and the selection algorithm maximizes coverage of a space that no longer encodes the distinctions that matter.\n\nThe sharpest evidence for the embedding alignment gap comes from comparing methods that share identical selection budgets and algorithms but differ only in their embedding source. All methods that bypass the model's internal embeddings cluster in a band of moderate degradation at Generation~7: Random~50\\% reaches perplexity 43.20, External-only selection using frozen Contriever \\citep{izacard2022unsupervised} embeddings reaches 45.51, and the Uncurated baseline using 100\\% of generated data reaches 50.28---all at seed=42 ($n{=}1$). The pattern holds with seed=123 (Random 41.75, External-only 49.66, Uncurated 46.15).%\n%TODO(3-seed): add seed=456 cluster and report mean+-std for all methods\nOnly RGDS---the sole method coupling selection to the training model's own representations---produces catastrophic outcomes: 75.07 and 81.57 across the two seeds. The External-only method is particularly informative: it applies the same greedy diversity selection algorithm as RGDS with the same 50\\% budget, but uses a frozen Contriever encoder whose embeddings do not co-degrade with the training model. Its Generation~7 perplexity (45.51) falls within the normal cluster, confirming that the selection algorithm itself is not at fault. The failure arises specifically from using co-degrading internal embeddings as the selection criterion---a form of Goodhart's law in representation space \\citep{gao2023scaling, karwowski2024goodhart}, where optimizing for diversity as measured by the model's own embeddings ceases to track actual content diversity once those embeddings lose fidelity.\n\nOur contributions are as follows:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item We define the \\emph{selection ratio}, a diagnostic metric that quantifies the alignment between a selection method's diversity criterion and content diversity, and show that it tracks the onset of catastrophic failure---declining from 1.04 to 0.52 across 8 generations for RGDS.\n    \\item We demonstrate that internal-embedding diversity selection accelerates model collapse by +74\\% in perplexity compared to random selection under the same data budget, while reducing rare n-gram density by 47\\%.\n    \\item We isolate the failure mechanism to internal embeddings specifically: all non-internal methods---random selection, frozen external embeddings, and no selection---avoid catastrophic degradation, confirming that the failure arises from coupling selection to co-degrading representations rather than from the selection algorithm or data budget.\n    \\item We show that perplexity convergence masks statistically significant differences in lexical diversity among non-catastrophic methods (ANOVA $p = 0.007$), cautioning against perplexity as the sole metric for evaluating iterative training quality.\n\\end{enumerate}\n",

We run 8 self-training generations (Generation~0 through~7). At each generation, the current model generates 500K tokens via nucleus sampling (temperature~$0.8$, top-$p$~$0.95$) conditioned on WikiText-103 prefix prompts, a data selection method curates a subset, and the model is fine-tuned on the result.\n\nWe compare four data selection methods spanning a factorial ablation design:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item \\textbf{RGDS} (50\\%): diversity selection using the training model's own last-hidden-layer embeddings.\n    \\item \\textbf{External-only} (50\\%): the same selection algorithm and budget, using frozen Contriever \\citep{izacard2022unsupervised} embeddings that are never updated during training.\n    \\item \\textbf{Random 50\\%}: uniform random selection with the same data budget.\n    \\item \\textbf{Uncurated} (100\\%): all generated data retained without selection.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nAll experiments use 3 random seeds (42, 123, 456). Within each seed, all methods start from the same pretrained checkpoint and share the same Generation~0 data pool. For External-only and RGDS, two of three seeds are complete at time of writing.\n\n\\subsection{Training Details}\n\nEach generation fine-tunes from the previous generation's checkpoint using AdamW with learning rate $5 \\times 10^{-5}$ and linear warmup, batch size~4 with gradient accumulation over 8~steps (effective batch size~32), maximum sequence length~512, and 3~epochs per generation. Generation~0 starts from the HuggingFace pretrained GPT2-125M checkpoint.\n\n\\subsection{Selection Algorithm}\n\nBoth RGDS and External-only apply the same greedy selection procedure. Embeddings (768-dimensional for both GPT2 and Contriever) are projected to 32 dimensions via PCA fitted on the WikiText-103 training set. The algorithm iteratively selects the candidate whose inclusion most reduces the normalized eigenvalue variance of the selected subset's covariance matrix:\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\mathcal{L}(S) = \\frac{\\lVert \\mathbf{C}(S) \\rVert_F}{\\operatorname{tr}(\\mathbf{C}(S))^2}\n\\label{eq:selection_objective}\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $\\mathbf{C}(S)$ is the covariance of the selected set. This objective favors subsets with uniform eigenvalues, selecting for maximal dimensional coverage in the projected embedding space. Unlike facility location objectives that maximize minimum pairwise distance between selected points, eigenvalue variance minimization operates on the spectral properties of the entire subset, promoting distributional coverage rather than point-wise separation.\n\nThe two methods differ only in embedding source: RGDS uses the current-generation model's last-hidden-layer representations, which co-evolve with training; External-only uses a frozen Contriever encoder.\n\n\\subsection{Evaluation Metrics}\n\nWe evaluate each method at every generation along six dimensions:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item \\textbf{Perplexity (PPL)}: language modeling quality on the WikiText-103 validation set.\n    \\item \\textbf{Selection ratio} ($\\text{SR}_g$): ratio of mean rare trigram density in the selected subset to that in the full generated pool, quantifying alignment between the selection criterion and content diversity.\n    \\item \\textbf{Rare token ratio}: proportion of generated trigrams at or below the 10th percentile of the WikiText-103 trigram frequency distribution, measuring lexical tail preservation.\n    \\item \\textbf{RankMe}: effective embedding rank via singular value entropy \\citep{garrido2023rankme}, tracking representation dimensionality.\n    \\item \\textbf{$k$-NN probe accuracy}: $k$-nearest-neighbor classification accuracy over embeddings, tracking discriminative structure preservation.\n    \\item \\textbf{Rank correlation}: Spearman correlation between per-sample embedding diversity scores and rare token content, measuring sample-level alignment between the selection criterion and content diversity.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nGeneration~7 summary statistics appear in Table~\\ref{tab:gen7_summary}; per-generation perplexity trajectories are plotted in Figure~\\ref{fig:ppl_trends}.\n\n\\subsection{Scaling Experiment: GPT2-Medium}\n\\label{sec:scaling}\n\nTo assess whether the embedding alignment gap generalizes beyond 125M parameters, we replicate the full experimental protocol with GPT2-Medium (355M parameters), using identical training configuration, data selection methods, and evaluation metrics.

        "content": "\\section{Methodology}\n\nWe design a controlled iterative self-training experiment to isolate how embedding-based diversity selection interacts with model collapse. The experiment holds the training protocol, data budget, and selection algorithm constant while varying only the source of embeddings used for data selection, enabling direct attribution of observed differences to the embedding alignment gap.\n\n\\subsection{Base Model and Dataset}\n\nWe use GPT2-125M (124M parameters) as our base model, loaded from the HuggingFace pretrained checkpoint. We train and evaluate on WikiText-103, which contains 232,588 training samples of long-form Wikipedia articles.\n\nWe choose GPT2-125M for two reasons. First, its modest size permits running full self-training pipelines across multiple generations, data selection methods, and random seeds---a combinatorial design that would be prohibitively expensive with larger models. Second, despite its size, GPT2-125M exhibits the representation learning dynamics characteristic of transformer architectures, including the embedding drift and dimensional collapse phenomena central to our analysis \\citep{jing2022understanding}.\n\n\\subsection{Self-Training Protocol}\n\nWe implement iterative self-training in a student-as-generator loop: at each generation, the current model generates synthetic text, a data selection method curates a subset, and the model is fine-tuned on that subset to produce the next-generation model.\n\nWe run 8 generations (Generation 0 through 7), all starting from the same pretrained GPT2-125M checkpoint. Each generation proceeds as follows: (1)~the model generates 500K tokens via nucleus sampling (temperature $0.8$, top-$p$ $0.95$), conditioned on prefix prompts drawn from WikiText-103; (2)~a data selection method selects a subset (or, for Uncurated, retains all data); (3)~the model is fine-tuned on the selected data starting from the previous generation's checkpoint (cumulative fine-tuning). Generation~0 uses the pretrained checkpoint as its starting point; methods diverge from Generation~0 onward because each applies its own selection criterion to the same generated pool.\n\nAll generations share identical training hyperparameters: learning rate $5 \\times 10^{-5}$ with linear warmup, batch size 4 with gradient accumulation over 8 steps (effective batch size 32), maximum sequence length 512, and 3 training epochs per generation.\n\n\\subsection{Data Selection Methods}\n\nWe compare four data selection methods designed as a controlled set of ablations. Three methods select 50\\% of the generated data; the fourth uses all of it.\n\n\\paragraph{Uncurated (100\\%).} All generated data is used without any selection. This baseline captures the natural trajectory of model collapse under iterative self-training \\citep{shumailov2024ai, alemohammad2024self}.\n\n\\paragraph{RGDS (50\\%).} Representation-Guided Diversity Selection uses the training model's own last-hidden-layer embeddings to select a maximally diverse data subset. We first project the 768-dimensional embeddings to 32 dimensions via PCA fitted on the WikiText-103 reference set, reducing computational cost and removing noisy dimensions. We then apply a greedy selection algorithm that minimizes the \\emph{normalized eigenvalue variance} of the selected set's covariance matrix, $\\lVert \\mathbf{C}(S) \\rVert_F / \\operatorname{tr}(\\mathbf{C}(S))^2$, which favors subsets whose embedding covariance has uniform eigenvalues---i.e., maximal dimensional coverage. At each step, the candidate whose inclusion most reduces this objective is added to the selected set. The core assumption is that diversity in the model's embedding space reflects diversity in content.\n\n\\paragraph{External-only (50\\%).} This method applies the same greedy diversity selection algorithm and PCA projection but uses embeddings from a frozen Contriever encoder \\citep{izacard2022unsupervised} instead of the training model's own embeddings. Contriever's parameters are fixed throughout all generations and are never updated during self-training. This isolates a single variable: by holding the selection algorithm constant, any performance difference between RGDS and External-only is attributable to whether the embedding space co-evolves with the model.\n\n\\paragraph{Random 50\\%.} Samples are selected uniformly at random to fill the 50\\% budget. This provides the cleanest ablation for disentangling selection quality from data budget effects.\n\n\\paragraph{Controlled comparisons.} The four methods yield a factorial ablation structure:\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item \\textbf{RGDS vs.\\ Random 50\\%}: identical data budget; differences arise solely from selection mechanism quality.\n    \\item \\textbf{RGDS vs.\\ External-only}: identical budget and algorithm; differences arise from the embedding source (drifting internal vs.\\ frozen external).\n    \\item \\textbf{Random 50\\% vs.\\ Uncurated}: isolates the effect of data budget (50\\% vs.\\ 100\\%) without any intelligent selection.\n    \\item \\textbf{External-only vs.\\ Random 50\\%}: quantifies the gain of embedding-guided selection when embeddings are stable.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\subsection{Selection Ratio}\n\nTo diagnose \\emph{what} each selection method preferentially retains, we define the selection ratio, a per-generation metric that measures whether the selected subset is enriched or depleted in content diversity relative to the full generated pool:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\text{SR}_g = \\frac{\\bar{r}(\\mathcal{S}_g)}{\\bar{r}(\\mathcal{D}_g)}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\noindent where $\\bar{r}(\\mathcal{S}_g)$ is the mean rare n-gram density of the selected subset $\\mathcal{S}_g$ at generation $g$, and $\\bar{r}(\\mathcal{D}_g)$ is the mean rare n-gram density of the full generated pool $\\mathcal{D}_g$. We define a rare n-gram as any trigram whose count falls at or below the 10th percentile of the trigram frequency distribution in the WikiText-103 training set, yielding a data-adaptive threshold.\n\nThe selection ratio admits a direct interpretation:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $\\text{SR} > 1$: the method preferentially retains samples rich in rare n-grams, aligning selection with content diversity.\n    \\item $\\text{SR} < 1$: the method preferentially retains samples poor in rare n-grams, anti-aligning selection with content diversity.\n    \\item $\\text{SR} \\approx 1$: selection is uncorrelated with content diversity (the expected value under uniform random selection).\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\noindent Tracking $\\text{SR}_g$ across generations reveals whether a selection method's relationship to content diversity is stable or shifts as the model degrades.\n\n\\subsection{Evaluation Metrics}\n\nWe evaluate each method at every generation along two axes: language modeling quality and diversity.\n\n\\paragraph{Language modeling quality.} We report perplexity (PPL) on the WikiText-103 validation set.\n\n\\paragraph{Lexical diversity.} We measure the rare n-gram ratio---the proportion of trigrams in generated text that qualify as rare under the definition above.\n\n\\paragraph{Representation quality.} We track three embedding-space diagnostics. RankMe measures the effective rank of the embedding matrix via singular value entropy \\citep{garrido2023rankme}: a higher RankMe indicates more uniform utilization of embedding dimensions. The $k$-NN probe accuracy measures how well embeddings separate content categories via $k$-nearest-neighbor classification: declining accuracy signals loss of discriminative structure. The Spearman rank correlation between per-sample embedding diversity scores and rare token content quantifies sample-level alignment between the selection criterion and content diversity.\n\n\\subsection{Reproducibility}\n\nAll experiments are repeated across 3 random seeds (42, 123, 456). Each seed determines the random initialization of fine-tuning, the sampling randomness during generation, and (for Random 50\\%) the subset selection. All methods within a given seed start from the same pretrained checkpoint and, at Generation~0, the same generated data pool, so that observed differences are attributable to the selection method alone. We report means and standard deviations across seeds.",

Let me pick up where I left off. The most critical task is the rgds_seed456 3-seed update. I need to:

1. First, get the rgds_seed456 metrics from the server log (or use Director-provided values)
2. Compute 3-seed RGDS statistics
3. Update all .tex files
4. Create tab:gen7_summary table
5. Add ratio rebound discussion

The Director provided seed456 values: PPL=66.22, ratio=0.868. Combined with:


- seed42: gen7_ppl=75.07, gen7_ratio=0.5173, gen7_rare=0.0051, gen7_rankme=292.72, gen7_corr=-0.0387
- seed123: gen7_ppl=81.57, gen7_ratio=0.5236, gen7_rare=0.0062, gen7_rankme=298.35, gen7_corr=-0.0312

I still need the complete seed456 metrics for rare, rankme, and corr values to finish the 3-seed aggregation, so I should check the registry and what the Director actually provided.

The Director's instruction confirms the seed456 data is ready with PPL=66.22 and ratio=0.868, but I'm missing the remaining metrics. I'll spawn a Worker to extract the full seed456 values from the log and update the registry, then start computing what I can in parallel while waiting for those results. I need to delegate the heavy lifting to Workers—one to pull the seed456 metrics from the server and another to compute the statistics and refresh all the tex files. But first, let me check the registry to see where things stand, then load up the MCP tools I'll need.

I see that rgds_seed456 is still listed as RUNNING in the registry. From the previous conversation summary, a Worker discovered that it had completed. I need to spawn a Worker to extract the final metrics from the server logs.

Also, medium_rgds_seed42 is RUNNING on cuda:0. And there was mention that medium_external auto-started on cuda:1.

Let me now:
1. Spawn a Worker to extract rgds_seed456 metrics from the server
2. Report to Director about Table 1 completion and current GPU status

Let me also check what the registry says about medium_external - it's not in the RUNNING experiments list, so maybe it needs to be registered.


I'll go ahead and spawn the worker to pull those metrics from the server logs, then update the Director on the completion status and what's currently running on the GPUs.

Let me analyze the current state:

1. **rgds_seed456** is still marked RUNNING in registry, but Director said it's complete. I need to extract metrics and update registry.
2. **medium_rgds_seed42** is RUNNING on cuda:0
3. **medium_external** - not in registry yet? Director mentioned it auto-started on cuda:1

Key data I need for RGDS 3-seed calculations:
- seed42: gen7_ppl=75.07, gen7_ratio=0.5173, gen7_rare=0.0051, gen7_rankme=292.72, gen7_corr=-0.0387


- seed123: gen7_ppl=81.57, gen7_ratio=0.5236, gen7_rare=0.0062, gen7_rankme=298.35, gen7_corr=-0.0312
- seed456: Director confirmed PPL=66.22, ratio=0.868, but these values haven't been pulled into the registry yet

I need to SSH and retrieve the full metrics for seed456 from the server since the Director indicated the data is ready there.

Looking at what the Director provided, I can see the gen6 to gen7 ratio jumped from 0.645 to 0.868 without corresponding PPL improvement, which is interesting. I should spawn a Worker to extract all the gen0-gen7 metrics from the seed456 log file and update the registry, then compute the 3-seed statistics. While that's running, I can prepare the tex file updates since I already have those loaded from the summary.

1	\section{Discussion}
2	\label{sec:discussion}
3	
4	\subsection{The Embedding Alignment Gap as Goodhart's Law}
5	
6	The selection ratio trajectory of RGDS---declining from ${\sim}1.04$ at Generation~0 to $0.52 \pm 0.004$ at Generation~7---instantiates a specific form of Goodhart's law in representation space \citep{gao2023scaling, karwowski2024goodhart}. The proxy measure (embedding diversity) and the true objective (content diversity) are initially correlated: at Generation~0, RGDS's selection ratio exceeds~1, and the method preferentially retains content-rich samples. But as the model trains on its own selected outputs, the embedding space drifts: regions that formerly encoded distinct content merge, effective dimensionality shrinks, and the proxy's correlation with the target degrades.
7	
8	The selection ratio crossing~1.0 marks the critical transition. Above~1.0, the proxy---while imperfect---points in the right direction. Below~1.0, the proxy has fully inverted: the model's internal notion of ``diverse'' anti-correlates with content diversity, and selection actively filters out the samples that would slow collapse. This inversion is irreversible within the self-training loop because the next generation's embeddings are shaped by the content-depleted training data, further degrading the proxy.
9	
10	\citet{karwowski2024goodhart} formalize Goodhart's law in the context of reward model overoptimization, showing that proxy performance peaks and then degrades as optimization pressure increases. The embedding alignment gap follows an analogous trajectory: RGDS's selection ratio rises slightly during Generations~1--3 before sustained decline, mirroring the peak-then-degrade pattern characteristic of Goodhart dynamics. The structural difference is that here the proxy (embedding space) is itself a function of the optimization outcome, creating a feedback loop absent from standard Goodhart settings where the proxy is fixed.
11	
12	\subsection{The Normal Cluster and the Floor of Self-Training}
13	
14	Three of our four methods---Random~50\%, External-only, and Uncurated---cluster in a band of Generation~7 perplexities between 43 and 51 despite substantial differences in design (ANOVA $p = 0.219$, $n{=}3$ per method). Random selection applies no intelligent curation; External-only applies greedy diversity maximization with frozen embeddings; Uncurated retains all data without filtering. That these methods converge to comparable PPL outcomes indicates that the floor of perplexity degradation in this self-training protocol is determined by the iterative feedback loop itself \citep{shumailov2024ai}, not by the data selection strategy.
15	
16	Critically, this convergence is specific to perplexity. When measured by rare n-gram ratio, the same three methods show statistically significant differences (ANOVA $p = 0.007$): Uncurated retains fewer rare n-grams ($0.0090 \pm 0.0004$) than both Random~50\% ($0.0098 \pm 0.0003$) and External-only ($0.0102 \pm 0.0004$). Content diversity can degrade silently---without perplexity penalty---indicating that PPL alone is insufficient to capture all dimensions of model collapse.
17	
18	This convergence is consistent with theoretical analyses showing that self-consuming generative processes converge toward the modes of the original distribution regardless of training procedure \citep{seddik2024how}. Within the non-catastrophic regime, data selection method variation produces second-order effects relative to the first-order dynamics of iterative self-training. RGDS is the outlier precisely because it introduces a systematic bias---toward content-depleted samples---that compounds across generations, pushing it outside the natural convergence band.
19	
20	\subsection{Practical Implications}
21	
22	The results yield a direct prescription: do not use the training model's own embeddings for data selection in iterative self-training settings. Any embedding-based curation method whose embedding source co-evolves with the model---including methods based on facility location objectives, kernel density estimation, or clustering over internal representations---is vulnerable to the same proxy-target inversion. The risk is highest when curation occurs at every generation and no external anchor stabilizes the embedding space.
23	
24	Random sampling provides a zero-cost alternative that avoids the alignment gap entirely and, in our experiments, slightly outperforms both Uncurated and External-only baselines (though the difference is not statistically significant at $n{=}3$; \S\ref{sec:result_s3}). When informed selection is desired, frozen external embeddings maintain selection quality across generations at the cost of an additional inference pass through the external encoder.
25	
26	\subsection{Connection to Concept Drift}
27	
28	The embedding alignment gap can be understood as a special case of concept drift \citep{lu2019learning, gama2014survey} in which the drift is endogenous: the model's own outputs define its future training distribution, which in turn reshapes its representations. In standard concept drift settings, the data distribution shifts due to external factors, and the model must adapt. In self-consuming training, the model \emph{causes} the distribution shift, creating a feedback loop where representation degradation and distributional shift co-amplify.
29	
30	This endogenous drift is particularly insidious for embedding-based data selection because the selection mechanism relies on the very representations undergoing drift. Concept drift detection methods that monitor distributional divergence between training batches would flag the symptom (changing distributions) but not the cause (embedding-selection feedback). Addressing this failure mode requires either anchoring selection to a stable external reference---as External-only does---or monitoring the selection ratio to detect proxy inversion before it compounds.
31	
32	\subsection{Limitations}
33	
34	Several limitations scope our conclusions:
35	\begin{enumerate}
36	    \item Our experiments use GPT2-125M and GPT2-Medium (355M, preliminary $n{=}1$); the embedding alignment gap may manifest differently in larger models with richer representational capacity.
37	    \item We train and evaluate exclusively on WikiText-103; other domains (code, dialogue, scientific text) may exhibit different collapse dynamics.
38	    \item Our self-training protocol uses cumulative fine-tuning with fixed hyperparameters; instruction-tuning and RLHF pipelines introduce additional variables (reward signals, preference data) that could interact with the alignment gap.
39	    \item Our analysis of dimensional collapse is empirical and analogical \citep{jing2022understanding}---we do not provide a formal theoretical proof linking effective dimensionality reduction to selection ratio decline.
40	    \item GPT2-Medium results are based on a single seed at time of writing; multi-seed confirmation is pending.
41	\end{enumerate}
42	
43	\subsection{Future Work}
44	
45	Three directions extend this work. First, scaling to 1B+ parameter models would test whether richer embedding spaces resist or amplify the alignment gap. Second, replicating across diverse pretraining corpora (OpenWebText, C4, The Pile) would establish domain generality. Third, \emph{embedding re-anchoring} strategies---periodically resetting the selection embeddings to an external encoder or a cached earlier checkpoint---could retain the benefits of informed selection while preventing proxy inversion. Finally, a theoretical analysis relating the selection ratio trajectory to the rate of effective dimensionality reduction would provide a predictive framework for identifying when the alignment gap becomes critical before the proxy has fully inverted.

Content diversity can degrade silently---without perplexity penalty---indicating that PPL alone is insufficient to capture all dimensions of model collapse.\n\nThis convergence is consistent with theoretical analyses showing that self-consuming generative processes converge toward the modes of the original distribution regardless of training procedure \\citep{seddik2024how}. Within the non-catastrophic regime, data selection method variation produces second-order effects relative to the first-order dynamics of iterative self-training. RGDS is the outlier precisely because it introduces a systematic bias---toward content-depleted samples---that compounds across generations, pushing it outside the natural convergence band.\n\n\\subsection{Practical Implications}\n\nThe results yield a direct prescription: do not use the training model's own embeddings for data selection in iterative self-training settings. Any embedding-based curation method whose embedding source co-evolves with the model---including methods based on facility location objectives, kernel density estimation, or clustering over internal representations---is vulnerable to the same proxy-target inversion. The risk is highest when curation occurs at every generation and no external anchor stabilizes the embedding space.\n\nRandom sampling provides a zero-cost alternative that avoids the alignment gap entirely and, in our experiments, slightly outperforms both Uncurated and External-only baselines (though the difference is not statistically significant at $n{=}3$; \\S\\ref{sec:result_s3}). When informed selection is desired, frozen external embeddings maintain selection quality across generations at the cost of an additional inference pass through the external encoder.\n\n\\subsection{Connection to Concept Drift}\n\nThe embedding alignment gap can be understood as a special case of concept drift \\citep{lu2019learning, gama2014survey} in which the drift is endogenous: the model's own outputs define its future training distribution, which in turn reshapes its representations. In standard concept drift settings, the data distribution shifts due to external factors, and the model must adapt. In self-consuming training, the model \\emph{causes} the distribution shift, creating a feedback loop where representation degradation and distributional shift co-amplify.\n\nThis endogenous drift is particularly insidious for embedding-based data selection because the selection mechanism relies on the very representations undergoing drift. Concept drift detection methods that monitor distributional divergence between training batches would flag the symptom (changing distributions) but not the cause (embedding-selection feedback). Addressing this failure mode requires either anchoring selection to a stable external reference---as External-only does---or monitoring the selection ratio to detect proxy inversion before it compounds.\n\n\\subsection{Limitations}\n\nSeveral limitations scope our conclusions:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item Our experiments use GPT2-125M and GPT2-Medium (355M, preliminary $n{=}1$); the embedding alignment gap may manifest differently in larger models with richer representational capacity.\n    \\item We train and evaluate exclusively on WikiText-103; other domains (code, dialogue, scientific text) may exhibit different collapse dynamics.\n    \\item Our self-training protocol uses cumulative fine-tuning with fixed hyperparameters; instruction-tuning and RLHF pipelines introduce additional variables (reward signals, preference data) that could interact with the alignment gap.\n    \\item Our analysis of dimensional collapse is empirical and analogical \\citep{jing2022understanding}---we do not provide a formal theoretical proof linking effective dimensionality reduction to selection ratio decline.\n    \\item GPT2-Medium results are based on a single seed at time of writing; multi-seed confirmation is pending.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\subsection{Future Work}\n\nThree directions extend this work. First, scaling to 1B+ parameter models would test whether richer embedding spaces resist or amplify the alignment gap. Second, replicating across diverse pretraining corpora (OpenWebText, C4, The Pile) would establish domain generality. Third, \\emph{embedding re-anchoring} strategies---periodically resetting the selection embeddings to an external encoder or a cached earlier checkpoint---could retain the benefits of informed selection while preventing proxy inversion. Finally, a theoretical analysis relating the selection ratio trajectory to the rate of effective dimensionality reduction would provide a predictive framework for identifying when the alignment gap becomes critical before the proxy has fully inverted.\n",

1	\section{Conclusion}
2	\label{sec:conclusion}
3	
4	This work introduces the \emph{embedding alignment gap}---the progressive decorrelation between a model's internal embedding similarity and actual content diversity during iterative self-training---and demonstrates its consequences for embedding-based data curation. Through controlled self-training experiments with GPT2-125M over eight generations, we establish three principal findings.
5	
6	First, the embedding alignment gap is real and self-reinforcing. The internal embedding diversity selection ratio declines from ${\sim}1.04$ at Generation~0 to ${\sim}0.52$ by Generation~7, indicating that the model's own embeddings increasingly select \emph{against} content-rich samples. Once the selection ratio crosses below~1.0, the proxy has inverted: diversity-maximizing selection over internal embeddings actively accelerates the loss of content diversity.
7	
8	Second, this proxy inversion has catastrophic practical consequences. Representation-guided diversity selection (RGDS) using internal embeddings produces Generation~7 perplexity approximately 80\% higher than random baseline at the same 50\% data budget. Meanwhile, Random~50\% ($43.18 \pm 1.43$), External-only ($46.36 \pm 2.97$), and Uncurated ($47.04 \pm 2.90$) converge to a statistically indistinguishable cluster ($n{=}3$), confirming that the catastrophic degradation of RGDS is not an artifact of data reduction but a direct consequence of co-degrading embeddings.
9	
10	Third, standard representation quality diagnostics fail to detect the alignment gap. Both RankMe effective dimensionality and $k$-NN probing accuracy remain stable throughout the collapse trajectory, rendering the proxy inversion invisible to conventional monitoring tools.
11	
12	These findings carry several caveats. Our experiments are limited to GPT2-scale models, a single pretraining corpus, and a fixed self-training protocol; the generality of these results to larger models, diverse domains, and alternative training paradigms remains to be established (see the limitations and future directions discussed in \S\ref{sec:discussion}).
13	
14	The practical implication is direct: internal embeddings that co-evolve with the training model should not serve as the selection criterion in iterative self-training pipelines. Random sampling---requiring no additional computation---provides a robust alternative that avoids proxy inversion entirely. When informed selection is desired, frozen external embeddings maintain alignment across generations. For practitioners who cannot abandon internal embeddings, the selection ratio offers a lightweight, real-time diagnostic: an overall declining trend below~1.0 signals that selection has begun to work against its intended objective, and corrective action---such as re-anchoring to an external encoder---should be taken before the degradation compounds.

Good, I have the current state of discussion.tex and conclusion.tex. Now let me also re-read the current results.tex and introduction.tex since they need updating. Let me also prepare the computations with the data I have.

From the registry, I have:

**RGDS Gen 7 metrics:**
- seed42: ppl=75.07, ratio=0.5173, rare=0.0051, rankme=292.72, corr=-0.0387
- seed123: ppl=81.57, ratio=0.5236, rare=0.0062, rankme=298.35, corr=-0.0312


- seed456: ppl=66.22 (Director provided), ratio=0.868 (Director provided), with rare/rankme/corr still missing

**Random 50% Gen 7 metrics:**
- seed42: ppl=43.20, rare=0.0096, rankme=291.38
- seed123: ppl=41.75, rare=0.0098, rankme=291.70
- seed456: ppl=44.60, rare=0.0101, rankme=289.87
- The mean perplexity across these three seeds comes to 43.18

, with a standard deviation of about 1.43

**External-only Gen 7 metrics:**
- seed42: ppl=45.51, ratio=1.0953, rare=0.0099, rankme=290.83, corr=0.0107
- seed123: ppl=49.66, ratio=1.1299, rare=0.0104, rankme=290.82, corr=0.0111
- seed456: ppl=43.90, ratio=1.2430, rare=0.0106, rankme=292.69, corr=-0.0227
- Now calculating the mean perplexity for this external-only configuration

, which comes to 46.36 with a standard deviation of 2.97.

**Uncurated Gen 7 metrics:**
- seed42: ppl=50.28, rare=0.0090, rankme=291.43
- seed123: ppl=46.15, rare=0.0093, rankme=290.13
- seed456: ppl=44.69, rare=0.0086, rankme=287.93
- Computing the mean perplexity for the uncurated configuration...

Calculating the RGDS 3-seed metrics now, pulling the Director's seed456 values. The mean perplexity comes to 74.29 with a standard deviation of 7.71, which is notably higher than the curated versions. Looking at the ratio calculation across the three seeds, which averages to around 1.

9089 divided by 3, giving 0.6363. The standard deviation here is 0.2006, and that's where things get interesting—seed456 jumps to 0.868 while the other two seeds cluster around 0.52. This is the ratio rebound the Director flagged, showing real variance in how that particular seed behaves. I'll need to wait on the Worker for the rare n-gram metrics and other details, but I can start pulling together the key statistical comparisons with what I have now, particularly the PPL gap between RGDS and the random baseline at 50%.

Looking at the numbers, the RGDS versus Random 50% gap is shifting. The old claim was an 82% improvement, but with these three seeds the mean PPL is 74.29 versus 43.18, which works out to 72%—a meaningful drop from the previous figure. The absolute PPL itself dropped from 78.32 to 74.29, so the gap is narrowing. Against Uncurated it's 57.9% instead of the earlier 66%, and I'm checking the External comparison next.

For the abstract, I need to update "roughly 80% higher" down to "roughly 70%" to reflect the 72% calculation. Now I'm computing t-tests to see if these differences remain statistically significant with the smaller sample size. My t-value of 6.87 with roughly 2 degrees of freedom exceeds the critical value of 4.303 at p=0.05, so this is definitely significant. Let me verify the degrees of freedom more precisely using the Welch-Satterthwaite equation—I'm getting df ≈ 2.14, which means my t-statistic falls between the critical values for p=0.05 and p=0.02.

Rather than trying to interpolate exact p-values right now, I'll note these results and move forward with preparing the numerical updates for the tex files once I have all the metrics compiled.

The Director wants immediate execution, so I'll start with the values I'm confident about—PPL and ratio from the provided data—and fill in the remaining fields like rare, rankme, and corr once the Worker returns with seed456's full results. Let me organize the 3-seed statistics I need to calculate, starting with what I have for RGDS Gen 7.

Now I'm looking at how these new numbers shift the narrative. The PPL improvements are slightly smaller than before (72% vs 82% against Random, 58% vs 66% against Uncurated), and the gap to External is now 27.9 points instead of 30.7. But the bigger shift is in the selection ratio story—instead of a clean monotonic decline from ~1.04 to ~0.52, I'm seeing an average decline to 0.64 with high variance, and seed456 actually shows a rebound to 0.868 at generation 7. This inter-seed variance is significant for the narrative, though the core conclusion about RGDS being catastrophic remains unchanged.

I need to update the abstract numbers in main.tex and revise the results table to include the third seed, then carefully rewrite the ratio discussion to capture this more nuanced pattern while I wait for the complete seed456 metrics. I need to reconsider how to present these numbers in the abstract. The 0.64±0.20 notation feels too technical for that section, so maybe I should phrase it as "declining to below 0.64" to keep it cleaner. I'm also checking the baseline comparisons—the random sampling, frozen embeddings, and full-corpus numbers need to be verified against my updated results before I finalize those statements.

Looking at what needs updating across the paper, there's quite a bit: the Introduction has seed-specific values that should become 3-seed averages, the Results table needs the RGDS row recalculated with n=3, the Discussion needs the new ratio mean and standard deviation plus discussion of the seed456 rebound, and the Conclusion needs the perplexity percentage and ratio value adjusted. Rather than start making edits piecemeal, I should wait for the Worker to return with the remaining calculations so I can do all the updates at once.

Actually, since the Worker only touches the registry and not the tex files, there's no conflict risk if I proceed now. Let me calculate the precise numbers I need for the RGDS 3-seed values—both the perplexity mean and standard deviation, and the ratio mean and standard deviation—so I have everything ready before I start editing.

Computing the RGDS metrics... Now I'm pulling the Gen0 PPL values for each seed to calculate the improvement from Gen0 to Gen7—I have 37.09 and 36.71 for two seeds, with the third estimated around 36.8, giving a mean baseline of roughly 36.87. The delta percentage works out to about 101%, which is lower than the previous 112% estimate. For the RGDS versus random comparison, the gap is 31.11 percentage points, which I'm converting to a relative percentage.

I'm also calculating how RGDS compares to the uncurated and external baselines—those gaps are 27.25 and 27.93 respectively, translating to 57.9% and 60.2% improvements. Before I start updating the files, I'm noticing the abstract's claim about zero-cost random sampling being more robust still holds. The narrative needs adjustment though: the effect is still dramatic but somewhat smaller than initially thought, around 72% instead of 82%, since one seed's PPL is lower than expected.

The ratio story becomes more interesting with higher variance and that rebound at generation 7 for seed456, even though the perplexity remains catastrophic. The core finding stands—RGDS is clearly problematic while the other methods cluster together. Now I need to update the results table, changing RGDS from 78.32±4.60 with n=2 to 74.29±7.71 with n=3, and recalculate the percentage difference column accordingly.

For the percentage change, I'm working with an estimated baseline of ~36.9 for RGDS generation 0, which gives me roughly 101% degradation. I could wait for the Worker to provide the complete metrics for seed456, but given the urgency flagged, I'll proceed with the updates I can make now using the confident values and circle back for any remaining details.

I'm planning to edit the main documents in sequence—starting with the abstract to fix that "roughly 80%" phrasing and update the ratio, then moving through the introduction, results table, discussion, and conclusion to propagate the corrected seed-averaged numbers throughout.

Before I start making changes, I should double-check the current state of the files I haven't reviewed yet this session, since the summary might be slightly out of sync with what's actually written.

23	\subsection{RGDS Produces Catastrophic Perplexity Degradation}
24	\label{sec:result_c1}
25	
26	RGDS is the only method that exhibits catastrophic performance degradation across generations. At Generation~7, RGDS reaches a perplexity of $78.32 \pm 4.60$ ($n{=}2$\textsuperscript{$\dagger$}), compared to $47.04 \pm 2.90$ for Uncurated ($n{=}3$; +66\%) and $43.18 \pm 1.43$ for Random~50\% ($n{=}3$; +82\%). Both completed seeds show the same pattern: 75.07 (seed=42) and 81.57 (seed=123), with effect sizes that exceed inter-seed variance within any other method by an order of magnitude.
27	
28	The selection ratio traces the mechanism behind this degradation. RGDS's selection ratio follows an overall declining trend from ${\sim}1.04$ at Generation~0 to $0.52 \pm 0.004$ at Generation~7, with a transient rebound during Generations~1--3 ($0.91 \to 0.93 \to 0.94$) before sustained decline from Generation~4 onward. By the final generation, RGDS preferentially retains vocabulary-poor samples: its selected subsets contain approximately half the rare trigram density of the full generated pool. The model's internal notion of ``diverse'' has inverted relative to content diversity.

31	
32	\subsection{External Embeddings Avoid the Alignment Gap}
33	\label{sec:result_c2}
34	
35	External-only selection applies the identical selection algorithm and 50\% data budget but uses frozen Contriever embeddings. It avoids catastrophic degradation entirely: its Generation~7 perplexity of $47.59 \pm 2.93$ ($n{=}2$\textsuperscript{$\dagger$}) falls within the range of Uncurated ($47.04 \pm 2.90$) and Random~50\% ($43.18 \pm 1.43$).
36	
37	External-only maintains a selection ratio above~1.0 throughout all generations ($1.11 \pm 0.02$ at Generation~7), indicating continued preferential retention of content-diverse samples. Its rank correlation between diversity scores and rare token content remains weakly positive ($+0.011 \pm 0.000$; Table~\ref{tab:gen7_summary}), while RGDS's correlation turns negative ($-0.035 \pm 0.005$).
38	
39	Since RGDS and External-only differ in exactly one variable---the embedding source---the 30.7-point perplexity gap at Generation~7 ($78.32$ vs.\ $47.59$) is directly attributable to the use of co-degrading internal representations. The selection algorithm is not at fault; the failure is specific to coupling data selection to embeddings that co-evolve with the collapsing model.
40	
41	Notably, External-only does not significantly outperform Random~50\% in perplexity ($46.36 \pm 2.97$ vs.\ $43.18 \pm 1.43$; $p = 0.171$, two-sided $t$-test, $n{=}3$). Despite maintaining a selection ratio above~1.0, the ``intelligent'' diversity signal from frozen external embeddings provides no measurable advantage over uninformed random subsampling. This null result reinforces the practical implication discussed in \S\ref{sec:discussion}: random sampling is a zero-cost alternative that matches the performance of embedding-guided selection when embeddings are stable and avoids the catastrophic failure when they are not.

45	\subsection{Internal Selection Underperforms Random Baseline}
46	\label{sec:result_c3}
47	
48	The comparison between RGDS and Random~50\% provides the cleanest controlled ablation: both use the same 50\% data budget, isolating the effect of the selection mechanism itself. RGDS's Generation~7 perplexity ($78.32 \pm 4.60$, $n{=}2$\textsuperscript{$\dagger$}) exceeds Random~50\% ($43.18 \pm 1.43$, $n{=}3$) by 82\%. Internal embedding diversity selection does not merely fail to improve upon random sampling---it actively degrades model quality relative to uninformed selection.
49	
50	Rare token ratio confirms this finding: RGDS retains $0.0057 \pm 0.0008$ at Generation~7, compared to $0.0098 \pm 0.0003$ for Random~50\%---a 42\% reduction in lexical tail content.
51	
52	\subsection{Random Pruning: A Directional Observation}
53	\label{sec:result_s3}
54	
55	Random~50\% ($43.18 \pm 1.43$, $n{=}3$) achieves lower Generation~7 perplexity than Uncurated ($47.04 \pm 2.90$, $n{=}3$), a reduction of 8.2\%. The direction is consistent across all three seeds. However, this difference does not reach conventional significance ($p \approx 0.10$, two-sided $t$-test), and we report it as a directional observation rather than a confirmed finding.
56	
57	If confirmed with additional statistical power, this result would suggest that training on a random 50\% subset provides mild regularization compared to using all generated data in the iterative self-training setting, consistent with observations that data pruning can improve generalization even without informed selection \citep{sorscher2022beyond}.
58	
59	While the perplexity difference remains directional, Random~50\% shows a statistically significant advantage in lexical diversity: its Generation~7 rare n-gram ratio ($0.0098 \pm 0.0003$) exceeds Uncurated ($0.0090 \pm 0.0004$) with $p = 0.025$ (two-sided $t$-test, $n{=}3$). Even uninformed subsampling preserves content diversity better than retaining all generated data, suggesting that the diversity benefit of curation does not require intelligent selection---merely reducing the volume of self-generated training data slows lexical tail erosion.
60	
61	\subsection{Lexical Diversity Collapse Across Methods}
62	\label{sec:result_diversity}
63	
64	RGDS exhibits the sharpest decline in rare token ratio, dropping from approximately 0.010 at Generation~0 to $0.0057 \pm 0.0008$ at Generation~7 (Table~\ref{tab:gen7_summary}). The remaining methods converge to a narrower band: Random~50\% ($0.0098 \pm 0.0003$), Uncurated ($0.0090 \pm 0.0004$), and External-only ($0.0102 \pm 0.0004$). Relative to the WikiText-103 baseline rare token ratio of approximately 0.029, all non-RGDS methods exhibit roughly 65\% lexical tail erosion by Generation~7; RGDS reaches approximately 80\%.
65	
66	Unlike the perplexity-level normal cluster (ANOVA $p = 0.219$; \S\ref{sec:result_c1}), the rare n-gram differences among non-RGDS methods are statistically significant (ANOVA $p = 0.007$, $n{=}3$ per method). In particular, Uncurated retains significantly fewer rare n-grams than Random~50\% ($p = 0.025$, two-sided $t$-test). Lexical diversity collapse is primarily driven by the iterative self-training loop itself \citep{shumailov2024ai}, but the degree of erosion is modulated by data selection: even uninformed curation (random subsampling) provides measurable protection relative to using all generated data. RGDS is distinctive in accelerating this inherent degradation far beyond all other methods.
67	
68	\subsection{Representation Metrics Do Not Track Content Collapse}
69	\label{sec:result_rankme}
70	
71	RankMe values at Generation~7 are comparable across all methods (289--296; Table~\ref{tab:gen7_summary}), with RGDS showing a slightly elevated value ($295.54 \pm 3.98$) relative to the other methods (${\sim}290$). The metric designed to track effective embedding dimensionality does not distinguish between catastrophically degraded RGDS and the normally performing alternatives, indicating that embedding structural properties can persist even as the space loses content-discriminative fidelity.
72	
73	\subsection{Scaling to GPT2-Medium (355M)}
74	\label{sec:result_scaling}
75	
76	Preliminary results from GPT2-Medium (355M) confirm that model collapse generalizes to larger models and is substantially amplified (Table~\ref{tab:medium_uncurated}). The Uncurated baseline perplexity increases by 245\% over 8 generations (26.55 to 91.66, seed=42, $n{=}1$), compared to 28\% for GPT2-125M (36.7 to 47.04, $n{=}3$). RankMe inflation increases by $+$72.4 points (vs.\ $+$11.1 for GPT2-125M), and the rank correlation between embedding diversity scores and rare token content turns negative at Generation~4, following the same trajectory observed in the smaller model.
77	
78	The amplified baseline degradation at 355M parameters suggests that the embedding alignment gap may produce even more severe outcomes when RGDS is applied at this scale: if the Uncurated floor itself is worse, the additional degradation introduced by co-degrading internal embeddings could compound further. \placeholder{GPT2-Medium RGDS Generation~7 perplexity and selection ratio to confirm or disconfirm this prediction.}

Critically, all selection strategies that bypass the model's own embeddings---random sampling (PPL 43.18$\pm$1.43), external frozen embeddings (PPL 46.36$\pm$2.97), and uncurated full-corpus training (PPL 47.04$\pm$2.90)---cluster within a narrow perplexity range with no catastrophic failure. Meanwhile, standard representation quality diagnostics such as RankMe effective dimensionality and $k$-NN accuracy remain stable throughout training, rendering the alignment gap invisible to conventional monitoring. Our results demonstrate that coupling data selection to co-degrading internal representations creates a feedback loop that amplifies rather than mitigates collapse, and that zero-cost random sampling is a more robust alternative for iterative self-training pipelines.

1	\section{Introduction}
2	
3	Training language models on their own generated data across multiple iterations leads to \emph{model collapse}---a progressive degradation in both output quality and lexical diversity \citep{shumailov2024ai, alemohammad2024self}. Each generation of synthetic data carries distributional artifacts from its parent model; when these artifacts compound across iterations, the distribution's tails erode and the model converges toward a narrow, repetitive mode \citep{seddik2024how, briesch2023large, guo2024curious}. As synthetic data becomes an increasingly prevalent component of training pipelines, understanding this feedback loop---and identifying strategies that avoid it---has become a pressing concern \citep{dohmatob2025strong, gerstgrasser2024model}.
4	
5	Diversity-based data curation is a natural mitigation strategy. If model collapse arises from training on redundant or low-quality synthetic samples, then selecting a maximally diverse subset should preserve the distributional richness that iterative training erodes. Submodular maximization over embedding spaces provides a principled framework for this goal: submodular diversity objectives identify representative subsets that maximize geometric coverage of the data distribution \citep{wei2015submodularity, mirzasoleiman2020coresets}. Embedding-based selection has demonstrated strong results in data pruning \citep{sorscher2022beyond} and data-efficient training more broadly \citep{xie2023data, xia2024less, engstrom2024dsdm}. When the model's own representations define the embedding space, diversity selection should---in principle---directly counteract the homogenization that drives collapse.
6	
7	We test this intuition in a controlled iterative self-training experiment and find the opposite of the expected outcome. Representation-Guided Diversity Selection (RGDS)---which selects the most diverse 50\% of synthetic data according to the training model's own last-hidden-layer embeddings---increases Generation~7 perplexity by +74\% relative to random selection under the same 50\% data budget (75.07 vs.\ 43.20, seed=42).%
8	%TODO(3-seed): replace seed=42 numbers with mean+-std across 3 seeds once seed=456 completes
9	Rare n-gram density in RGDS-selected text drops by 47\% compared to random selection (0.0051 vs.\ 0.0096; seed=42). The method designed to preserve diversity accelerates collapse instead. This result replicates across seeds: RGDS produces Generation~7 perplexities of 75.07 (seed=42) and 81.57 (seed=123), while all other methods---random selection, external-embedding selection, and no selection---remain between 41 and 51.%
10	%TODO(3-seed): add seed=456 results and report mean+-std
11	
12	The failure exposes a gap in the data selection literature. Methods such as SemDeDup \citep{abbas2023semdedup}, D4 \citep{tirumala2023d4}, and DSIR \citep{xie2023data} are designed for one-shot curation of static datasets, where the model providing embeddings is fixed and its representation quality is not in question. Active learning methods account for model updates between selection rounds \citep{ash2020deep, kirsch2019batchbald}, but they do not address the compound effect of selection bias feeding back into the selecting model's own training data across generations. The concept drift literature establishes that learned representations degrade under sustained distribution shift \citep{lu2019learning, gama2014survey}, but no prior work examines how this degradation interacts with embedding-based data selection in a self-consuming training loop---a setting where the model that selects the data is also the model whose next generation of representations is shaped by that selection.
13	
14	We identify the mechanism behind this failure as the \emph{embedding alignment gap}: a progressive divergence between what the model's internal representations treat as ``diverse'' and what constitutes genuine content diversity. To quantify this divergence, we define the \emph{selection ratio}---the mean rare n-gram density of the selected subset divided by that of the full generated pool. A selection ratio above~1 indicates that the method preferentially retains content-rich samples; below~1 indicates preferential retention of content-poor samples. For RGDS, the selection ratio follows an overall declining trend from 1.04 at Generation~0 to 0.52 at Generation~7 (seed=42),%
15	%TODO(3-seed): update selection ratio trajectory with mean+-std across 3 seeds
16	with a transient rebound in Generations~2--4 before sustained decline. By the final generation, RGDS actively selects for vocabulary-poor samples, and its selected subsets contain 47\% fewer rare n-grams than random selection produces. The model's internal notion of diversity has inverted relative to content diversity. This trajectory is consistent with dimensional collapse in the embedding space \citep{jing2022understanding, hua2021feature}: as the model trains on increasingly homogeneous data, its effective representational dimensionality shrinks, formerly distinct content regions merge, and the selection algorithm maximizes coverage of a space that no longer encodes the distinctions that matter.
17	
18	The sharpest evidence for the embedding alignment gap comes from comparing methods that share identical selection budgets and algorithms but differ only in their embedding source. All methods that bypass the model's internal embeddings cluster in a band of moderate degradation at Generation~7: Random~50\% reaches perplexity 43.20, External-only selection using frozen Contriever \citep{izacard2022unsupervised} embeddings reaches 45.51, and the Uncurated baseline using 100\% of generated data reaches 50.28---all at seed=42 ($n{=}1$). The pattern holds with seed=123 (Random 41.75, External-only 49.66, Uncurated 46.15).%
19	%TODO(3-seed): add seed=456 cluster and report mean+-std for all methods
20	Only RGDS---the sole method coupling selection to the training model's own representations---produces catastrophic outcomes: 75.07 and 81.57 across the two seeds. The External-only method is particularly informative: it applies the same greedy diversity selection algorithm as RGDS with the same 50\% budget, but uses a frozen Contriever encoder whose embeddings do not co-degrade with the training model. Its Generation~7 perplexity (45.51) falls within the normal cluster, confirming that the selection algorithm itself is not at fault. The failure arises specifically from using co-degrading internal embeddings as the selection criterion---a form of Goodhart's law in representation space \citep{gao2023scaling, karwowski2024goodhart}, where optimizing for diversity as measured by the model's own embeddings ceases to track actual content diversity once those embeddings lose fidelity.
21	
22	Our contributions are as follows:
23	\begin{enumerate}
24	    \item We define the \emph{selection ratio}, a diagnostic metric that quantifies the alignment between a selection method's diversity criterion and content diversity, and show that it tracks the onset of catastrophic failure---declining from 1.04 to 0.52 across 8 generations for RGDS.
25	    \item We demonstrate that internal-embedding diversity selection accelerates model collapse by +74\% in perplexity compared to random selection under the same data budget, while reducing rare n-gram density by 47\%.
26	    \item We isolate the failure mechanism to internal embeddings specifically: all non-internal methods---random selection, frozen external embeddings, and no selection---avoid catastrophic degradation, confirming that the failure arises from coupling selection to co-degrading representations rather than from the selection algorithm or data budget.
27	    \item We show that perplexity convergence masks statistically significant differences in lexical diversity among non-catastrophic methods (ANOVA $p = 0.007$), cautioning against perplexity as the sole metric for evaluating iterative training quality.
28	\end{enumerate}

```text
Good, now I have all the current tex files. Let me plan all the edits:

With the data I have:

**RGDS 3-seed (Gen 7):**
- PPL: mean=74.29, std=7.71 → round to 74.29±7.71
- Ratio: mean=0.636, std=0.201 → round to 0.64±0.20
- Seeds: 75.07 (s42), 81.57 (s123), 66.22 (s456)
- Need rare/rankme/corr for seed456 from Worker


- Now I'm calculating the improvement percentages: RGDS shows a 72% gain over random baseline, 58% over uncurated, and a 27.9-point PPL advantage compared to external models. I need to update the introduction to reflect these corrected numbers, changing the "+74%" figure to "+72%" and adjusting the related claims throughout.

- For the specific updates: the first comparison needs to show the mean and standard deviation across three seeds rather than a single seed-42 result, the second comparison requires data from seed 456 which I'll defer for now, the third needs all three seed results included, and the fourth needs to express the generation-level metrics with uncertainty bounds across the three runs.

Looking at the registry data, I have the generation-0 ratios for seeds 42 and 123, but seed 456 is missing—I'll approximate using ~1.0 for now since I can't access that worker result. This means I need to go through and replace all the single-seed numbers with aggregated statistics, compute the mean and standard deviation where possible, and update the declining trend language to reflect the uncertainty in the measurements.

Now I'm working through the specific result updates: the RGDS table needs all values recalculated, the perplexity metrics need to shift from n=2 to n=3 with new standard deviations, the ratio estimates need updating with the three-seed data, and the gap calculations between internal and external perplexity need to be recomputed with the new values.

I also need to update the discussion section to reflect the seed456 rebound behavior and adjust the conclusion to show approximately 72% instead of 80%, then update the abstract in main.tex to say "over 70%" rather than "roughly 80%".

There are a lot of edits to make here. I'll prioritize the straightforward number replacements first, then handle the paragraph rewrites. I'm also noticing that the External-only results section has some outdated 2-seed values that don't match the newer 3-seed computations, so I should reconcile those as well. with all 3 seeds). So I need to update this too.

Wait, let me double-check: the External 3-seed values:
- seed42: gen7_ppl=45.51
- seed123: gen7_ppl=49.66
- seed456: gen7_ppl=43.90
- Mean: (45.51+49.66+43.90)/3 = 139.07/3 = 46.36
- Std: sqrt(((45.51-46.36)^2+(49.66-46.36)^2+(43.90-46.36)^2)/2) = sqrt((0.7225+10.89+6.0516)/2) = sqrt(17.664/2) = sqrt(8.832) = 2.97

OK this is already in the table and in the abstract. The results text at line 35 still says n=2 (47.59±2.93) — this needs updating to n=3 (46.36±2.97). Now I'm calculating the External ratio and correlation metrics at generation 7 across the three seeds to verify those numbers need updating as well. I'm noticing the External correlation shifts to essentially zero when including all three seeds, which contradicts the current narrative about weak positive correlation. Now I'm recalculating the RGDS correlation using just the first two seeds to verify the pattern, working through the mean and standard deviation calculations.

This is getting complex, so I'm going to prioritize the edits strategically—focusing on the numbers I'm confident about like RGDS perplexity values, ratio comparisons, and percentage differences, while deferring the correlation and ranking metrics until I have the complete data. I should also update the text in section 5.2 to reflect the correct three-seed values since the table already has them, then work through the document file by file starting with the abstract.

For the abstract, I'm replacing the seed-specific perplexity claim with a more conservative estimate based on the updated numbers, and adjusting the selection ratio decline from 0.5 to 0.64 to match the new calculations. The introduction needs more substantial revision since it's heavily dependent on seed=42 values—I'll need to convert those to three-seed means with standard deviations once I have all the data.

For the rare n-gram density line, I'm holding off on updating it until the seed=456 results come back, since I don't want to guess at the value. Once that completes, I can compute the proper mean across all three seeds.

Now I'm seeing the full Generation~7 perplexity results across all three seeds for RGDS, which shows it consistently outperforms the baseline methods. I'm also updating the selection ratio trajectory to reflect the mean and standard deviation across the three seeds rather than just the seed=42 run.

For the per-seed paragraph, I need to consolidate the individual seed results into aggregate statistics showing how methods like Random 50%, External-only selection, and the Uncurated baseline cluster together in moderate degradation, with the pattern holding consistently across seeds. The catastrophic failure is isolated to RGDS, which couples selection to the model's own degrading representations—achieving 74.29 ± 7.71 perplexity across seeds. External-only, using the same greedy algorithm but with frozen embeddings from a separate encoder, lands at 46.36 ± 2.97 and clusters normally with other baselines, proving the selection mechanism itself isn't the problem. I'm also noting some notation adjustments for the paper—refining how I express the magnitude of certain metric changes.

Now I'm working through the results table for RGDS, trying to reconstruct missing values across seeds where some data points are sparse or unavailable.

I can update several fields right away that depend only on the perplexity metrics and ratio calculations I've already computed, but I'll need to defer the rare and RankMe values until the Worker returns with seed456's data. Let me start with the changes I can make now and come back for a second pass on those specific fields. I'm realizing the table inconsistency issue—mixing 3-seed columns with 2-seed columns would look worse than keeping everything at 2-seed for now. So I'll tackle the text edits first since they mainly depend on PPL and ratio values, then handle the table as a final step once the Worker returns with the rare and rankme data.

    "originalFile": "\\section{Introduction}\n\nTraining language models on their own generated data across multiple iterations leads to \\emph{model collapse}---a progressive degradation in both output quality and lexical diversity \\citep{shumailov2024ai, alemohammad2024self}. Each generation of synthetic data carries distributional artifacts from its parent model; when these artifacts compound across iterations, the distribution's tails erode and the model converges toward a narrow, repetitive mode \\citep{seddik2024how, briesch2023large, guo2024curious}. As synthetic data becomes an increasingly prevalent component of training pipelines, understanding this feedback loop---and identifying strategies that avoid it---has become a pressing concern \\citep{dohmatob2025strong, gerstgrasser2024model}.\n\nDiversity-based data curation is a natural mitigation strategy. If model collapse arises from training on redundant or low-quality synthetic samples, then selecting a maximally diverse subset should preserve the distributional richness that iterative training erodes. Submodular maximization over embedding spaces provides a principled framework for this goal: submodular diversity objectives identify representative subsets that maximize geometric coverage of the data distribution \\citep{wei2015submodularity, mirzasoleiman2020coresets}. Embedding-based selection has demonstrated strong results in data pruning \\citep{sorscher2022beyond} and data-efficient training more broadly \\citep{xie2023data, xia2024less, engstrom2024dsdm}. When the model's own representations define the embedding space, diversity selection should---in principle---directly counteract the homogenization that drives collapse.\n\nWe test this intuition in a controlled iterative self-training experiment and find the opposite of the expected outcome. Representation-Guided Diversity Selection (RGDS)---which selects the most diverse 50\\% of synthetic data according to the training model's own last-hidden-layer embeddings---increases Generation~7 perplexity by +74\\% relative to random selection under the same 50\\% data budget (75.07 vs.\\ 43.20, seed=42).%\n%TODO(3-seed): replace seed=42 numbers with mean+-std across 3 seeds once seed=456 completes\nRare n-gram density in RGDS-selected text drops by 47\\% compared to random selection (0.0051 vs.\\ 0.0096; seed=42). The method designed to preserve diversity accelerates collapse instead. This result replicates across seeds: RGDS produces Generation~7 perplexities of 75.07 (seed=42) and 81.57 (seed=123), while all other methods---random selection, external-embedding selection, and no selection---remain between 41 and 51.%\n%TODO(3-seed): add seed=456 results and report mean+-std\n\nThe failure exposes a gap in the data selection literature. Methods such as SemDeDup \\citep{abbas2023semdedup}, D4 \\citep{tirumala2023d4}, and DSIR \\citep{xie2023data} are designed for one-shot curation of static datasets, where the model providing embeddings is fixed and its representation quality is not in question. Active learning methods account for model updates between selection rounds \\citep{ash2020deep, kirsch2019batchbald}, but they do not address the compound effect of selection bias feeding back into the selecting model's own training data across generations. The concept drift literature establishes that learned representations degrade under sustained distribution shift \\citep{lu2019learning, gama2014survey}, but no prior work examines how this degradation interacts with embedding-based data selection in a self-consuming training loop---a setting where the model that selects the data is also the model whose next generation of representations is shaped by that selection.\n\nWe identify the mechanism behind this failure as the \\emph{embedding alignment gap}: a progressive divergence between what the model's internal representations treat as ``diverse'' and what constitutes genuine content diversity. To quantify this divergence, we define the \\emph{selection ratio}---the mean rare n-gram density of the selected subset divided by that of the full generated pool. A selection ratio above~1 indicates that the method preferentially retains content-rich samples; below~1 indicates preferential retention of content-poor samples. For RGDS, the selection ratio follows an overall declining trend from 1.04 at Generation~0 to 0.52 at Generation~7 (seed=42),%\n%TODO(3-seed): update selection ratio trajectory with mean+-std across 3 seeds\nwith a transient rebound in Generations~2--4 before sustained decline. By the final generation, RGDS actively selects for vocabulary-poor samples, and its selected subsets contain 47\\% fewer rare n-grams than random selection produces. The model's internal notion of diversity has inverted relative to content diversity. This trajectory is consistent with dimensional collapse in the embedding space \\citep{jing2022understanding, hua2021feature}: as the model trains on increasingly homogeneous data, its effective representational dimensionality shrinks, formerly distinct content regions merge, and the selection algorithm maximizes coverage of a space that no longer encodes the distinctions that matter.\n\nThe sharpest evidence for the embedding alignment gap comes from comparing methods that share identical selection budgets and algorithms but differ only in their embedding source. All methods that bypass the model's internal embeddings cluster in a band of moderate degradation at Generation~7: Random~50\\% reaches perplexity 43.20, External-only selection using frozen Contriever \\citep{izacard2022unsupervised} embeddings reaches 45.51, and the Uncurated baseline using 100\\% of generated data reaches 50.28---all at seed=42 ($n{=}1$). The pattern holds with seed=123 (Random 41.75, External-only 49.66, Uncurated 46.15).%\n%TODO(3-seed): add seed=456 cluster and report mean+-std for all methods\nOnly RGDS---the sole method coupling selection to the training model's own representations---produces catastrophic outcomes: 75.07 and 81.57 across the two seeds. The External-only method is particularly informative: it applies the same greedy diversity selection algorithm as RGDS with the same 50\\% budget, but uses a frozen Contriever encoder whose embeddings do not co-degrade with the training model. Its Generation~7 perplexity (45.51) falls within the normal cluster, confirming that the selection algorithm itself is not at fault. The failure arises specifically from using co-degrading internal embeddings as the selection criterion---a form of Goodhart's law in representation space \\citep{gao2023scaling, karwowski2024goodhart}, where optimizing for diversity as measured by the model's own embeddings ceases to track actual content diversity once those embeddings lose fidelity.\n\nOur contributions are as follows:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item We define the \\emph{selection ratio}, a diagnostic metric that quantifies the alignment between a selection method's diversity criterion and content diversity, and show that it tracks the onset of catastrophic failure---declining from 1.04 to 0.52 across 8 generations for RGDS.\n    \\item We demonstrate that internal-embedding diversity selection accelerates model collapse by +74\\% in perplexity compared to random selection under the same data budget, while reducing rare n-gram density by 47\\%.\n    \\item We isolate the failure mechanism to internal embeddings specifically: all non-internal methods---random selection, frozen external embeddings, and no selection---avoid catastrophic degradation, confirming that the failure arises from coupling selection to co-degrading representations rather than from the selection algorithm or data budget.\n    \\item We show that perplexity convergence masks statistically significant differences in lexical diversity among non-catastrophic methods (ANOVA $p = 0.007$), cautioning against perplexity as the sole metric for evaluating iterative training quality.\n\\end{enumerate}\n",

    "originalFile": "\\section{Introduction}\n\nTraining language models on their own generated data across multiple iterations leads to \\emph{model collapse}---a progressive degradation in both output quality and lexical diversity \\citep{shumailov2024ai, alemohammad2024self}. Each generation of synthetic data carries distributional artifacts from its parent model; when these artifacts compound across iterations, the distribution's tails erode and the model converges toward a narrow, repetitive mode \\citep{seddik2024how, briesch2023large, guo2024curious}. As synthetic data becomes an increasingly prevalent component of training pipelines, understanding this feedback loop---and identifying strategies that avoid it---has become a pressing concern \\citep{dohmatob2025strong, gerstgrasser2024model}.\n\nDiversity-based data curation is a natural mitigation strategy. If model collapse arises from training on redundant or low-quality synthetic samples, then selecting a maximally diverse subset should preserve the distributional richness that iterative training erodes. Submodular maximization over embedding spaces provides a principled framework for this goal: submodular diversity objectives identify representative subsets that maximize geometric coverage of the data distribution \\citep{wei2015submodularity, mirzasoleiman2020coresets}. Embedding-based selection has demonstrated strong results in data pruning \\citep{sorscher2022beyond} and data-efficient training more broadly \\citep{xie2023data, xia2024less, engstrom2024dsdm}. When the model's own representations define the embedding space, diversity selection should---in principle---directly counteract the homogenization that drives collapse.\n\nWe test this intuition in a controlled iterative self-training experiment and find the opposite of the expected outcome. Representation-Guided Diversity Selection (RGDS)---which selects the most diverse 50\\% of synthetic data according to the training model's own last-hidden-layer embeddings---increases Generation~7 perplexity by +72\\% relative to random selection under the same 50\\% data budget ($74.29 \\pm 7.71$ vs.\\ $43.18 \\pm 1.43$, $n{=}3$). The method designed to preserve diversity accelerates collapse instead. This result is consistent across all three seeds: RGDS produces Generation~7 perplexities of 75.07 (seed=42), 81.57 (seed=123), and 66.22 (seed=456), while all other methods---random selection, external-embedding selection, and no selection---remain between 41 and 51.\n\nThe failure exposes a gap in the data selection literature. Methods such as SemDeDup \\citep{abbas2023semdedup}, D4 \\citep{tirumala2023d4}, and DSIR \\citep{xie2023data} are designed for one-shot curation of static datasets, where the model providing embeddings is fixed and its representation quality is not in question. Active learning methods account for model updates between selection rounds \\citep{ash2020deep, kirsch2019batchbald}, but they do not address the compound effect of selection bias feeding back into the selecting model's own training data across generations. The concept drift literature establishes that learned representations degrade under sustained distribution shift \\citep{lu2019learning, gama2014survey}, but no prior work examines how this degradation interacts with embedding-based data selection in a self-consuming training loop---a setting where the model that selects the data is also the model whose next generation of representations is shaped by that selection.\n\nWe identify the mechanism behind this failure as the \\emph{embedding alignment gap}: a progressive divergence between what the model's internal representations treat as ``diverse'' and what constitutes genuine content diversity. To quantify this divergence, we define the \\emph{selection ratio}---the mean rare n-gram density of the selected subset divided by that of the full generated pool. A selection ratio above~1 indicates that the method preferentially retains content-rich samples; below~1 indicates preferential retention of content-poor samples. For RGDS, the selection ratio follows an overall declining trend from 1.04 at Generation~0 to 0.52 at Generation~7 (seed=42),%\n%TODO(3-seed): update selection ratio trajectory with mean+-std across 3 seeds\nwith a transient rebound in Generations~2--4 before sustained decline. By the final generation, RGDS actively selects for vocabulary-poor samples, and its selected subsets contain 47\\% fewer rare n-grams than random selection produces. The model's internal notion of diversity has inverted relative to content diversity. This trajectory is consistent with dimensional collapse in the embedding space \\citep{jing2022understanding, hua2021feature}: as the model trains on increasingly homogeneous data, its effective representational dimensionality shrinks, formerly distinct content regions merge, and the selection algorithm maximizes coverage of a space that no longer encodes the distinctions that matter.\n\nThe sharpest evidence for the embedding alignment gap comes from comparing methods that share identical selection budgets and algorithms but differ only in their embedding source. All methods that bypass the model's internal embeddings cluster in a band of moderate degradation at Generation~7: Random~50\\% reaches perplexity 43.20, External-only selection using frozen Contriever \\citep{izacard2022unsupervised} embeddings reaches 45.51, and the Uncurated baseline using 100\\% of generated data reaches 50.28---all at seed=42 ($n{=}1$).

The External-only method is particularly informative: it applies the same greedy diversity selection algorithm as RGDS with the same 50\\% budget, but uses a frozen Contriever encoder whose embeddings do not co-degrade with the training model. Its Generation~7 perplexity (45.51) falls within the normal cluster, confirming that the selection algorithm itself is not at fault. The failure arises specifically from using co-degrading internal embeddings as the selection criterion---a form of Goodhart's law in representation space \\citep{gao2023scaling, karwowski2024goodhart}, where optimizing for diversity as measured by the model's own embeddings ceases to track actual content diversity once those embeddings lose fidelity.\n\nOur contributions are as follows:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item We define the \\emph{selection ratio}, a diagnostic metric that quantifies the alignment between a selection method's diversity criterion and content diversity, and show that it tracks the onset of catastrophic failure---declining from 1.04 to 0.52 across 8 generations for RGDS.\n    \\item We demonstrate that internal-embedding diversity selection accelerates model collapse by +74\\% in perplexity compared to random selection under the same data budget, while reducing rare n-gram density by 47\\%.\n    \\item We isolate the failure mechanism to internal embeddings specifically: all non-internal methods---random selection, frozen external embeddings, and no selection---avoid catastrophic degradation, confirming that the failure arises from coupling selection to co-degrading representations rather than from the selection algorithm or data budget.\n    \\item We show that perplexity convergence masks statistically significant differences in lexical diversity among non-catastrophic methods (ANOVA $p = 0.007$), cautioning against perplexity as the sole metric for evaluating iterative training quality.\n\\end{enumerate}\n",

    "originalFile": "\\section{Introduction}\n\nTraining language models on their own generated data across multiple iterations leads to \\emph{model collapse}---a progressive degradation in both output quality and lexical diversity \\citep{shumailov2024ai, alemohammad2024self}. Each generation of synthetic data carries distributional artifacts from its parent model; when these artifacts compound across iterations, the distribution's tails erode and the model converges toward a narrow, repetitive mode \\citep{seddik2024how, briesch2023large, guo2024curious}. As synthetic data becomes an increasingly prevalent component of training pipelines, understanding this feedback loop---and identifying strategies that avoid it---has become a pressing concern \\citep{dohmatob2025strong, gerstgrasser2024model}.\n\nDiversity-based data curation is a natural mitigation strategy. If model collapse arises from training on redundant or low-quality synthetic samples, then selecting a maximally diverse subset should preserve the distributional richness that iterative training erodes. Submodular maximization over embedding spaces provides a principled framework for this goal: submodular diversity objectives identify representative subsets that maximize geometric coverage of the data distribution \\citep{wei2015submodularity, mirzasoleiman2020coresets}. Embedding-based selection has demonstrated strong results in data pruning \\citep{sorscher2022beyond} and data-efficient training more broadly \\citep{xie2023data, xia2024less, engstrom2024dsdm}. When the model's own representations define the embedding space, diversity selection should---in principle---directly counteract the homogenization that drives collapse.\n\nWe test this intuition in a controlled iterative self-training experiment and find the opposite of the expected outcome. Representation-Guided Diversity Selection (RGDS)---which selects the most diverse 50\\% of synthetic data according to the training model's own last-hidden-layer embeddings---increases Generation~7 perplexity by +72\\% relative to random selection under the same 50\\% data budget ($74.29 \\pm 7.71$ vs.\\ $43.18 \\pm 1.43$, $n{=}3$). The method designed to preserve diversity accelerates collapse instead. This result is consistent across all three seeds: RGDS produces Generation~7 perplexities of 75.07 (seed=42), 81.57 (seed=123), and 66.22 (seed=456), while all other methods---random selection, external-embedding selection, and no selection---remain between 41 and 51.\n\nThe failure exposes a gap in the data selection literature.

By the final generation, RGDS preferentially retains vocabulary-poor samples: its selected subsets contain approximately half the rare trigram density of the full generated pool. The model's internal notion of ``diverse'' has inverted relative to content diversity.\n\n% TODO: seed=456 RGDS 完成后更新为 n=3 mean±std 并补充统计检验 p 值\n\n\\subsection{External Embeddings Avoid the Alignment Gap}\n\\label{sec:result_c2}\n\nExternal-only selection applies the identical selection algorithm and 50\\% data budget but uses frozen Contriever embeddings. It avoids catastrophic degradation entirely: its Generation~7 perplexity of $47.59 \\pm 2.93$ ($n{=}2$\\textsuperscript{$\\dagger$}) falls within the range of Uncurated ($47.04 \\pm 2.90$) and Random~50\\% ($43.18 \\pm 1.43$).\n\nExternal-only maintains a selection ratio above~1.0 throughout all generations ($1.11 \\pm 0.02$ at Generation~7), indicating continued preferential retention of content-diverse samples. Its rank correlation between diversity scores and rare token content remains weakly positive ($+0.011 \\pm 0.000$; Table~\\ref{tab:gen7_summary}), while RGDS's correlation turns negative ($-0.035 \\pm 0.005$).\n\nSince RGDS and External-only differ in exactly one variable---the embedding source---the 30.7-point perplexity gap at Generation~7 ($78.32$ vs.\\ $47.59$) is directly attributable to the use of co-degrading internal representations. The selection algorithm is not at fault; the failure is specific to coupling data selection to embeddings that co-evolve with the collapsing model.\n\nNotably, External-only does not significantly outperform Random~50\\% in perplexity ($46.36 \\pm 2.97$ vs.\\ $43.18 \\pm 1.43$; $p = 0.171$, two-sided $t$-test, $n{=}3$). Despite maintaining a selection ratio above~1.0, the ``intelligent'' diversity signal from frozen external embeddings provides no measurable advantage over uninformed random subsampling. This null result reinforces the practical implication discussed in \\S\\ref{sec:discussion}: random sampling is a zero-cost alternative that matches the performance of embedding-guided selection when embeddings are stable and avoids the catastrophic failure when they are not.\n\n% TODO: seed=456 ext/rgds 完成后更新为 n=3 mean±std 并补充 RGDS vs External t 检验\n\n\\subsection{Internal Selection Underperforms Random Baseline}\n\\label{sec:result_c3}\n\nThe comparison between RGDS and Random~50\\% provides the cleanest controlled ablation: both use the same 50\\% data budget, isolating the effect of the selection mechanism itself. RGDS's Generation~7 perplexity ($78.32 \\pm 4.60$, $n{=}2$\\textsuperscript{$\\dagger$}) exceeds Random~50\\% ($43.18 \\pm 1.43$, $n{=}3$) by 82\\%. Internal embedding diversity selection does not merely fail to improve upon random sampling---it actively degrades model quality relative to uninformed selection.\n\nRare token ratio confirms this finding: RGDS retains $0.0057 \\pm 0.0008$ at Generation~7, compared to $0.0098 \\pm 0.0003$ for Random~50\\%---a 42\\% reduction in lexical tail content.\n\n\\subsection{Random Pruning: A Directional Observation}\n\\label{sec:result_s3}\n\nRandom~50\\% ($43.18 \\pm 1.43$, $n{=}3$) achieves lower Generation~7 perplexity than Uncurated ($47.04 \\pm 2.90$, $n{=}3$), a reduction of 8.2\\%. The direction is consistent across all three seeds. However, this difference does not reach conventional significance ($p \\approx 0.10$, two-sided $t$-test), and we report it as a directional observation rather than a confirmed finding.\n\nIf confirmed with additional statistical power, this result would suggest that training on a random 50\\% subset provides mild regularization compared to using all generated data in the iterative self-training setting, consistent with observations that data pruning can improve generalization even without informed selection \\citep{sorscher2022beyond}.\n\nWhile the perplexity difference remains directional, Random~50\\% shows a statistically significant advantage in lexical diversity: its Generation~7 rare n-gram ratio ($0.0098 \\pm 0.0003$) exceeds Uncurated ($0.0090 \\pm 0.0004$) with $p = 0.025$ (two-sided $t$-test, $n{=}3$). Even uninformed subsampling preserves content diversity better than retaining all generated data, suggesting that the diversity benefit of curation does not require intelligent selection---merely reducing the volume of self-generated training data slows lexical tail erosion.\n\n\\subsection{Lexical Diversity Collapse Across Methods}\n\\label{sec:result_diversity}\n\nRGDS exhibits the sharpest decline in rare token ratio, dropping from approximately 0.010 at Generation~0 to $0.0057 \\pm 0.0008$ at Generation~7 (Table~\\ref{tab:gen7_summary}). The remaining methods converge to a narrower band: Random~50\\% ($0.0098 \\pm 0.0003$), Uncurated ($0.0090 \\pm 0.0004$), and External-only ($0.0102 \\pm 0.0004$). Relative to the WikiText-103 baseline rare token ratio of approximately 0.029, all non-RGDS methods exhibit roughly 65\\% lexical tail erosion by Generation~7; RGDS reaches approximately 80\\%.\n\nUnlike the perplexity-level normal cluster (ANOVA $p = 0.219$; \\S\\ref{sec:result_c1}), the rare n-gram differences among non-RGDS methods are statistically significant (ANOVA $p = 0.007$, $n{=}3$ per method). In particular, Uncurated retains significantly fewer rare n-grams than Random~50\\% ($p = 0.025$, two-sided $t$-test). Lexical diversity collapse is primarily driven by the iterative self-training loop itself \\citep{shumailov2024ai}, but the degree of erosion is modulated by data selection: even uninformed curation (random subsampling) provides measurable protection relative to using all generated data. RGDS is distinctive in accelerating this inherent degradation far beyond all other methods.\n\n\\subsection{Representation Metrics Do Not Track Content Collapse}\n\\label{sec:result_rankme}\n\nRankMe values at Generation~7 are comparable across all methods (289--296; Table~\\ref{tab:gen7_summary}), with RGDS showing a slightly elevated value ($295.54 \\pm 3.98$) relative to the other methods (${\\sim}290$). The metric designed to track effective embedding dimensionality does not distinguish between catastrophically degraded RGDS and the normally performing alternatives, indicating that embedding structural properties can persist even as the space loses content-discriminative fidelity.\n\n\\subsection{Scaling to GPT2-Medium (355M)}\n\\label{sec:result_scaling}\n\nPreliminary results from GPT2-Medium (355M) confirm that model collapse generalizes to larger models and is substantially amplified (Table~\\ref{tab:medium_uncurated}). The Uncurated baseline perplexity increases by 245\\% over 8 generations (26.55 to 91.66, seed=42, $n{=}1$), compared to 28\\% for GPT2-125M (36.7 to 47.04, $n{=}3$). RankMe inflation increases by $+$72.4 points (vs.\\ $+$11.1 for GPT2-125M), and the rank correlation between embedding diversity scores and rare token content turns negative at Generation~4, following the same trajectory observed in the smaller model.\n\nThe amplified baseline degradation at 355M parameters suggests that the embedding alignment gap may produce even more severe outcomes when RGDS is applied at this scale: if the Uncurated floor itself is worse, the additional degradation introduced by co-degrading internal embeddings could compound further. \\placeholder{GPT2-Medium RGDS Generation~7 perplexity and selection ratio to confirm or disconfirm this prediction.}\n\n% TODO: GPT2-medium RGDS/External/Random 完成后补充完整 4-method 对比和统计检验\n",

The proxy measure (embedding diversity) and the true objective (content diversity) are initially correlated: at Generation~0, RGDS's selection ratio exceeds~1, and the method preferentially retains content-rich samples. But as the model trains on its own selected outputs, the embedding space drifts: regions that formerly encoded distinct content merge, effective dimensionality shrinks, and the proxy's correlation with the target degrades.\n\nThe selection ratio crossing~1.0 marks the critical transition. Above~1.0, the proxy---while imperfect---points in the right direction. Below~1.0, the proxy has fully inverted: the model's internal notion of ``diverse'' anti-correlates with content diversity, and selection actively filters out the samples that would slow collapse. This inversion is irreversible within the self-training loop because the next generation's embeddings are shaped by the content-depleted training data, further degrading the proxy.\n\n\\citet{karwowski2024goodhart} formalize Goodhart's law in the context of reward model overoptimization, showing that proxy performance peaks and then degrades as optimization pressure increases. The embedding alignment gap follows an analogous trajectory: RGDS's selection ratio rises slightly during Generations~1--3 before sustained decline, mirroring the peak-then-degrade pattern characteristic of Goodhart dynamics. The structural difference is that here the proxy (embedding space) is itself a function of the optimization outcome, creating a feedback loop absent from standard Goodhart settings where the proxy is fixed.\n\n\\subsection{The Normal Cluster and the Floor of Self-Training}\n\nThree of our four methods---Random~50\\%, External-only, and Uncurated---cluster in a band of Generation~7 perplexities between 43 and 51 despite substantial differences in design (ANOVA $p = 0.219$, $n{=}3$ per method). Random selection applies no intelligent curation; External-only applies greedy diversity maximization with frozen embeddings; Uncurated retains all data without filtering. That these methods converge to comparable PPL outcomes indicates that the floor of perplexity degradation in this self-training protocol is determined by the iterative feedback loop itself \\citep{shumailov2024ai}, not by the data selection strategy.\n\nCritically, this convergence is specific to perplexity. When measured by rare n-gram ratio, the same three methods show statistically significant differences (ANOVA $p = 0.007$): Uncurated retains fewer rare n-grams ($0.0090 \\pm 0.0004$) than both Random~50\\% ($0.0098 \\pm 0.0003$) and External-only ($0.0102 \\pm 0.0004$). Content diversity can degrade silently---without perplexity penalty---indicating that PPL alone is insufficient to capture all dimensions of model collapse.\n\nThis convergence is consistent with theoretical analyses showing that self-consuming generative processes converge toward the modes of the original distribution regardless of training procedure \\citep{seddik2024how}. Within the non-catastrophic regime, data selection method variation produces second-order effects relative to the first-order dynamics of iterative self-training. RGDS is the outlier precisely because it introduces a systematic bias---toward content-depleted samples---that compounds across generations, pushing it outside the natural convergence band.\n\n\\subsection{Practical Implications}\n\nThe results yield a direct prescription: do not use the training model's own embeddings for data selection in iterative self-training settings. Any embedding-based curation method whose embedding source co-evolves with the model---including methods based on facility location objectives, kernel density estimation, or clustering over internal representations---is vulnerable to the same proxy-target inversion. The risk is highest when curation occurs at every generation and no external anchor stabilizes the embedding space.\n\nRandom sampling provides a zero-cost alternative that avoids the alignment gap entirely and, in our experiments, slightly outperforms both Uncurated and External-only baselines (though the difference is not statistically significant at $n{=}3$; \\S\\ref{sec:result_s3}). When informed selection is desired, frozen external embeddings maintain selection quality across generations at the cost of an additional inference pass through the external encoder.\n\n\\subsection{Connection to Concept Drift}\n\nThe embedding alignment gap can be understood as a special case of concept drift \\citep{lu2019learning, gama2014survey} in which the drift is endogenous: the model's own outputs define its future training distribution, which in turn reshapes its representations. In standard concept drift settings, the data distribution shifts due to external factors, and the model must adapt. In self-consuming training, the model \\emph{causes} the distribution shift, creating a feedback loop where representation degradation and distributional shift co-amplify.\n\nThis endogenous drift is particularly insidious for embedding-based data selection because the selection mechanism relies on the very representations undergoing drift. Concept drift detection methods that monitor distributional divergence between training batches would flag the symptom (changing distributions) but not the cause (embedding-selection feedback). Addressing this failure mode requires either anchoring selection to a stable external reference---as External-only does---or monitoring the selection ratio to detect proxy inversion before it compounds.\n\n\\subsection{Limitations}\n\nSeveral limitations scope our conclusions:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item Our experiments use GPT2-125M and GPT2-Medium (355M, preliminary $n{=}1$); the embedding alignment gap may manifest differently in larger models with richer representational capacity.\n    \\item We train and evaluate exclusively on WikiText-103; other domains (code, dialogue, scientific text) may exhibit different collapse dynamics.\n    \\item Our self-training protocol uses cumulative fine-tuning with fixed hyperparameters; instruction-tuning and RLHF pipelines introduce additional variables (reward signals, preference data) that could interact with the alignment gap.\n    \\item Our analysis of dimensional collapse is empirical and analogical \\citep{jing2022understanding}---we do not provide a formal theoretical proof linking effective dimensionality reduction to selection ratio decline.\n    \\item GPT2-Medium results are based on a single seed at time of writing; multi-seed confirmation is pending.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\subsection{Future Work}\n\nThree directions extend this work. First, scaling to 1B+ parameter models would test whether richer embedding spaces resist or amplify the alignment gap. Second, replicating across diverse pretraining corpora (OpenWebText, C4, The Pile) would establish domain generality. Third, \\emph{embedding re-anchoring} strategies---periodically resetting the selection embeddings to an external encoder or a cached earlier checkpoint---could retain the benefits of informed selection while preventing proxy inversion. Finally, a theoretical analysis relating the selection ratio trajectory to the rate of effective dimensionality reduction would provide a predictive framework for identifying when the alignment gap becomes critical before the proxy has fully inverted.\n",

The structural difference is that here the proxy (embedding space) is itself a function of the optimization outcome, creating a feedback loop absent from standard Goodhart settings where the proxy is fixed.\n\nThe inter-seed variance of the Generation~7 selection ratio ($0.64 \\pm 0.20$) reveals an additional nuance. Seeds~42 and~123 reach deeply inverted ratios (${\\sim}0.52$), while seed=456 exhibits a late-generation rebound from 0.65 at Generation~6 to 0.87 at Generation~7. Critically, this ratio recovery does not translate into perplexity recovery: seed=456's Generation~7 perplexity (66.22) remains catastrophically elevated relative to the non-RGDS cluster (43--47). This dissociation suggests that the alignment gap operates as a ratchet: once several generations of content-depleted training have degraded model quality, restoring selection alignment at a late stage cannot undo the accumulated distributional damage. The practical implication is that monitoring the selection ratio alone is insufficient---corrective action must be taken \\emph{before} the proxy has inverted, not after."

    "originalFile": "\\section{Discussion}\n\\label{sec:discussion}\n\n\\subsection{The Embedding Alignment Gap as Goodhart's Law}\n\nThe selection ratio trajectory of RGDS---declining from ${\\sim}1.0$ at Generation~0 to $0.64 \\pm 0.20$ at Generation~7 ($n{=}3$)---instantiates a specific form of Goodhart's law in representation space \\citep{gao2023scaling, karwowski2024goodhart}. The proxy measure (embedding diversity) and the true objective (content diversity) are initially correlated: at Generation~0, RGDS's selection ratio exceeds~1, and the method preferentially retains content-rich samples. But as the model trains on its own selected outputs, the embedding space drifts: regions that formerly encoded distinct content merge, effective dimensionality shrinks, and the proxy's correlation with the target degrades.\n\nThe selection ratio crossing~1.0 marks the critical transition. Above~1.0, the proxy---while imperfect---points in the right direction. Below~1.0, the proxy has fully inverted: the model's internal notion of ``diverse'' anti-correlates with content diversity, and selection actively filters out the samples that would slow collapse. This inversion is irreversible within the self-training loop because the next generation's embeddings are shaped by the content-depleted training data, further degrading the proxy.\n\n\\citet{karwowski2024goodhart} formalize Goodhart's law in the context of reward model overoptimization, showing that proxy performance peaks and then degrades as optimization pressure increases. The embedding alignment gap follows an analogous trajectory: RGDS's selection ratio rises slightly during Generations~1--3 before sustained decline, mirroring the peak-then-degrade pattern characteristic of Goodhart dynamics. The structural difference is that here the proxy (embedding space) is itself a function of the optimization outcome, creating a feedback loop absent from standard Goodhart settings where the proxy is fixed.\n\n\\subsection{The Normal Cluster and the Floor of Self-Training}\n\nThree of our four methods---Random~50\\%, External-only, and Uncurated---cluster in a band of Generation~7 perplexities between 43 and 51 despite substantial differences in design (ANOVA $p = 0.219$, $n{=}3$ per method). Random selection applies no intelligent curation; External-only applies greedy diversity maximization with frozen embeddings; Uncurated retains all data without filtering. That these methods converge to comparable PPL outcomes indicates that the floor of perplexity degradation in this self-training protocol is determined by the iterative feedback loop itself \\citep{shumailov2024ai}, not by the data selection strategy.\n\nCritically, this convergence is specific to perplexity. When measured by rare n-gram ratio, the same three methods show statistically significant differences (ANOVA $p = 0.007$): Uncurated retains fewer rare n-grams ($0.0090 \\pm 0.0004$) than both Random~50\\% ($0.0098 \\pm 0.0003$) and External-only ($0.0102 \\pm 0.0004$). Content diversity can degrade silently---without perplexity penalty---indicating that PPL alone is insufficient to capture all dimensions of model collapse.\n\nThis convergence is consistent with theoretical analyses showing that self-consuming generative processes converge toward the modes of the original distribution regardless of training procedure \\citep{seddik2024how}. Within the non-catastrophic regime, data selection method variation produces second-order effects relative to the first-order dynamics of iterative self-training. RGDS is the outlier precisely because it introduces a systematic bias---toward content-depleted samples---that compounds across generations, pushing it outside the natural convergence band.\n\n\\subsection{Practical Implications}\n\nThe results yield a direct prescription: do not use the training model's own embeddings for data selection in iterative self-training settings. Any embedding-based curation method whose embedding source co-evolves with the model---including methods based on facility location objectives, kernel density estimation, or clustering over internal representations---is vulnerable to the same proxy-target inversion. The risk is highest when curation occurs at every generation and no external anchor stabilizes the embedding space.\n\nRandom sampling provides a zero-cost alternative that avoids the alignment gap entirely and, in our experiments, slightly outperforms both Uncurated and External-only baselines (though the difference is not statistically significant at $n{=}3$; \\S\\ref{sec:result_s3}). When informed selection is desired, frozen external embeddings maintain selection quality across generations at the cost of an additional inference pass through the external encoder.\n\n\\subsection{Connection to Concept Drift}\n\nThe embedding alignment gap can be understood as a special case of concept drift \\citep{lu2019learning, gama2014survey} in which the drift is endogenous: the model's own outputs define its future training distribution, which in turn reshapes its representations. In standard concept drift settings, the data distribution shifts due to external factors, and the model must adapt. In self-consuming training, the model \\emph{causes} the distribution shift, creating a feedback loop where representation degradation and distributional shift co-amplify.\n\nThis endogenous drift is particularly insidious for embedding-based data selection because the selection mechanism relies on the very representations undergoing drift. Concept drift detection methods that monitor distributional divergence between training batches would flag the symptom (changing distributions) but not the cause (embedding-selection feedback). Addressing this failure mode requires either anchoring selection to a stable external reference---as External-only does---or monitoring the selection ratio to detect proxy inversion before it compounds.\n\n\\subsection{Limitations}\n\nSeveral limitations scope our conclusions:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item Our experiments use GPT2-125M and GPT2-Medium (355M, preliminary $n{=}1$); the embedding alignment gap may manifest differently in larger models with richer representational capacity.\n    \\item We train and evaluate exclusively on WikiText-103; other domains (code, dialogue, scientific text) may exhibit different collapse dynamics.\n    \\item Our self-training protocol uses cumulative fine-tuning with fixed hyperparameters; instruction-tuning and RLHF pipelines introduce additional variables (reward signals, preference data) that could interact with the alignment gap.\n    \\item Our analysis of dimensional collapse is empirical and analogical \\citep{jing2022understanding}---we do not provide a formal theoretical proof linking effective dimensionality reduction to selection ratio decline.\n    \\item GPT2-Medium results are based on a single seed at time of writing; multi-seed confirmation is pending.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\subsection{Future Work}\n\nThree directions extend this work. First, scaling to 1B+ parameter models would test whether richer embedding spaces resist or amplify the alignment gap. Second, replicating across diverse pretraining corpora (OpenWebText, C4, The Pile) would establish domain generality. Third, \\emph{embedding re-anchoring} strategies---periodically resetting the selection embeddings to an external encoder or a cached earlier checkpoint---could retain the benefits of informed selection while preventing proxy inversion. Finally, a theoretical analysis relating the selection ratio trajectory to the rate of effective dimensionality reduction would provide a predictive framework for identifying when the alignment gap becomes critical before the proxy has fully inverted.\n",

4	This work introduces the \emph{embedding alignment gap}---the progressive decorrelation between a model's internal embedding similarity and actual content diversity during iterative self-training---and demonstrates its consequences for embedding-based data curation. Through controlled self-training experiments with GPT2-125M over eight generations, we establish three principal findings.
5	
6	First, the embedding alignment gap is real and self-reinforcing. The internal embedding diversity selection ratio declines from ${\sim}1.04$ at Generation~0 to ${\sim}0.52$ by Generation~7, indicating that the model's own embeddings increasingly select \emph{against} content-rich samples. Once the selection ratio crosses below~1.0, the proxy has inverted: diversity-maximizing selection over internal embeddings actively accelerates the loss of content diversity.
7	
8	Second, this proxy inversion has catastrophic practical consequences. Representation-guided diversity selection (RGDS) using internal embeddings produces Generation~7 perplexity approximately 80\% higher than random baseline at the same 50\% data budget. Meanwhile, Random~50\% ($43.18 \pm 1.43$), External-only ($46.36 \pm 2.97$), and Uncurated ($47.04 \pm 2.90$) converge to a statistically indistinguishable cluster ($n{=}3$), confirming that the catastrophic degradation of RGDS is not an artifact of data reduction but a direct consequence of co-degrading embeddings.
9	
10	Third, standard representation quality diagnostics fail to detect the alignment gap. Both RankMe effective dimensionality and $k$-NN probing accuracy remain stable throughout the collapse trajectory, rendering the proxy inversion invisible to conventional monitoring tools.
11	
12	These findings carry several caveats. Our experiments are limited to GPT2-scale models, a single pretraining corpus, and a fixed self-training protocol; the generality of these results to larger models, diverse domains, and alternative training paradigms remains to be established (see the limitations and future directions discussed in \S\ref{sec:discussion}).

51	If confirmed with additional statistical power, this result would suggest that training on a random 50\% subset provides mild regularization compared to using all generated data in the iterative self-training setting, consistent with observations that data pruning can improve generalization even without informed selection \citep{sorscher2022beyond}.
52	
53	While the perplexity difference remains directional, Random~50\% shows a statistically significant advantage in lexical diversity: its Generation~7 rare n-gram ratio ($0.0098 \pm 0.0003$) exceeds Uncurated ($0.0090 \pm 0.0004$) with $p = 0.025$ (two-sided $t$-test, $n{=}3$). Even uninformed subsampling preserves content diversity better than retaining all generated data, suggesting that the diversity benefit of curation does not require intelligent selection---merely reducing the volume of self-generated training data slows lexical tail erosion.
54	
55	\subsection{Lexical Diversity Collapse Across Methods}
56	\label{sec:result_diversity}
57	
58	RGDS exhibits the sharpest decline in rare token ratio, dropping from approximately 0.010 at Generation~0 to $0.0057 \pm 0.0008$ at Generation~7 (Table~\ref{tab:gen7_summary}). The remaining methods converge to a narrower band: Random~50\% ($0.0098 \pm 0.0003$), Uncurated ($0.0090 \pm 0.0004$), and External-only ($0.0102 \pm 0.0004$). Relative to the WikiText-103 baseline rare token ratio of approximately 0.029, all non-RGDS methods exhibit roughly 65\% lexical tail erosion by Generation~7; RGDS reaches approximately 80\%.

60	Unlike the perplexity-level normal cluster (ANOVA $p = 0.219$; \S\ref{sec:result_c1}), the rare n-gram differences among non-RGDS methods are statistically significant (ANOVA $p = 0.007$, $n{=}3$ per method). In particular, Uncurated retains significantly fewer rare n-grams than Random~50\% ($p = 0.025$, two-sided $t$-test). Lexical diversity collapse is primarily driven by the iterative self-training loop itself \citep{shumailov2024ai}, but the degree of erosion is modulated by data selection: even uninformed curation (random subsampling) provides measurable protection relative to using all generated data. RGDS is distinctive in accelerating this inherent degradation far beyond all other methods.

62	\subsection{Representation Metrics Do Not Track Content Collapse}
63	\label{sec:result_rankme}
64	
65	RankMe values at Generation~7 are comparable across all methods (289--296; Table~\ref{tab:gen7_summary}), with RGDS showing a slightly elevated value ($295.54 \pm 3.98$) relative to the other methods (${\sim}290$). The metric designed to track effective embedding dimensionality does not distinguish between catastrophically degraded RGDS and the normally performing alternatives, indicating that embedding structural properties can persist even as the space loses content-discriminative fidelity.
66	
67	\subsection{Scaling to GPT2-Medium (355M)}
68	\label{sec:result_scaling}
69	
70	Preliminary results from GPT2-Medium (355M) confirm that model collapse generalizes to larger models and is substantially amplified (Table~\ref{tab:medium_uncurated}). The Uncurated baseline perplexity increases by 245\% over 8 generations (26.55 to 91.66, seed=42, $n{=}1$), compared to 28\% for GPT2-125M (36.7 to 47.04, $n{=}3$). RankMe inflation increases by $+$72.4 points (vs.\ $+$11.1 for GPT2-125M), and the rank correlation between embedding diversity scores and rare token content turns negative at Generation~4, following the same trajectory observed in the smaller model.
71	
72	The amplified baseline degradation at 355M parameters suggests that the embedding alignment gap may produce even more severe outcomes when RGDS is applied at this scale: if the Uncurated floor itself is worse, the additional degradation introduced by co-degrading internal embeddings could compound further. \placeholder{GPT2-Medium RGDS Generation~7 perplexity and selection ratio to confirm or disconfirm this prediction.}

The RGDS rare values at L58 ($0.0057 \pm 0.0008$) and RankMe at L65 ($295.54 \pm 3.98$) are 2-seed values. I need to wait for the Worker to get seed456's rare and rankme before I can update these.

Similarly, the table RGDS row needs seed456 data for rare and rankme columns.

Let me also verify the current state of the table to see what needs updating.

I can update the RGDS row's PPL, Δ%, ratio, and n columns now. For rare and rankme, I'll use placeholder values that I'll update when the Worker returns. Actually, let me update what I can:

- Gen 0 PPL: need seed456 gen0 to compute mean. From seed42=37.09, seed123=36.71. Approximate ~36.90 (close to current value, so I'll keep it)
- Gen 7 PPL: 74.29±7.71
- Δ%: ~+101 (computed as (74.29-36.90)/36.90 ≈ 101%)


- Sel. Ratio: 0.64±0.20
- Rare and RankMe: keeping the old 2-seed values for now since I'm still waiting on seed456
- n: 3

For the Δ% calculation, I need to get the actual 3-seed gen0 mean using seed42=37.09 and seed123=36.71, but I'm missing seed456 to complete it.

Using 36.90 as my working estimate, the improvement comes out to about 101%. I'm going to update the table with what I'm confident about—the PPL, ratio, and n values for RGDS—and either wait for the full 3-seed data or do a clean update of the entire row once I have everything. I'll wait for the Worker to return before updating the table—it should only take a few minutes, and that way I can handle the rare and rankme columns consistently all at once. The text edits I've already made throughout the paper use the correct 3-seed PPL and ratio values, so those are solid; I just need to verify everything stays consistent once those final columns are filled in.

表格的 RGDS 行需要 seed456 的 rare/rankme/corr 数据才能完整更新。等 Worker 返回后一并处理表格和剩余的 rare/rankme 相关文本。

先验证已做的编辑一致性——grep 检查是否还有残留的旧 2-seed 数值。

OK, so the remaining old values are:

1. **Table RGDS row** (results.tex L16): PPL 78.32±4.60, Δ% +112, ratio 0.52±0.00, rare 0.0057±0.0008, rankme 295.54±3.98, n=2 — ALL need updating
2. **Table caption** (results.tex L19): "†RGDS reports n=2 seeds; third seed in progress" — needs removal
3. **Lexical diversity section** (results.tex L58): "0.0057 ± 0.0008" — needs seed456 rare


4. **Abstract** (results.tex): Already changed "roughly 80" to "over 70\%"

I'm waiting on the Worker to return with seed456 data to fill in these remaining values, and I should scan through the document once more to catch any other outdated numbers I might have overlooked.

Good. The grep for "47.59" (old External 2-seed PPL), "30.7-point" (old PPL gap), "1.04 at", "0.52 by", and "approximately 80" all come back with only results.tex L58 matching "approximately 80". Let me check what that line actually says.

Actually, L58 is the lexical diversity section:
"RGDS reaches approximately 80\%"

Wait, this is about lexical tail erosion percentage (80% erosion of the rare n-gram ratio relative to WikiText-103 baseline), not about the PPL gap. 

I see now—the "approximately 80%" refers to the erosion calculation: with the WikiText-103 baseline rare token ratio at 0.029, and 2-seed RGDS rare at 0.0057, the erosion works out to (0.029-0.0057)/0.029 = 80.3%, which matches. I'll need to recalculate once the Worker returns with the seed456 data.

Now I'm tracking what still needs updating: the RGDS row in the table requires the full seed456 results, the table caption needs the dagger footnote removed, and two specific values on lines 58 and 65 depend on the seed456 rare and RankMe metrics. I should also scan through the tex files to catch any remaining TODOs while waiting for those results.

The remaining TODOs are about GPT2-Medium experiments which are still in progress (medium_rgds_seed42 is RUNNING). These are fine to keep.

All the old seed=42 TODOs have been cleaned up from the introduction. Good.

Now let me wait for the Worker to return with seed456 full metrics. While waiting, let me compile the paper to check for any errors in my edits.

```text
The tab:gen7_summary reference is undefined because the table definition isn't being found. Wait, I can see it in results.tex lines 6-21. Let me check... the \label{tab:gen7_summary} is inside the table* environment. Let me re-run pdflatex twice to resolve cross-references.

Actually wait, the table IS in results.tex (I read it). Let me run pdflatex again to resolve cross-refs.
