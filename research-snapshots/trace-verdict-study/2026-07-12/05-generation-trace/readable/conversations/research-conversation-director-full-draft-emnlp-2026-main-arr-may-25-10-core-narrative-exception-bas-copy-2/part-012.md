The Director wants me to:

**P0 (mandatory):**
1. Add Ethics Statement after Limitations, before References
2. Prepare ARR Reproducibility Checklist (wait for raw materials)

**Suggestions (non-blocking):**
1. Enrich Discussion by pulling 2-3 sentence summaries of D1 (eval_loss decoupling) and D11 (VOTA cross-model confound) from appendix into main body
2. Add a data figure to the main body (cross_model_gap or calibration recommended)

Let me analyze the page budget first. The Director says "正文还有约 1 页空间（当前 ~7 页）". 

My compilation showed 8 pages with References starting on page 8, but the Director's estimate of ~7 pages for the main body suggests the actual text content ends around page 7.5, with References taking up the remainder. Since EMNLP counts only the main body against the 8-page limit, I actually have about 0.5 pages of room to work with.

Looking at what I can add: an Ethics Statement would take roughly 0.1-0.15 pages, enriching the Discussion section with additional summaries would add another 0.15-0.2 pages, and including one figure with caption would consume 0.3-0.4 pages. That totals around 0.6-0.75 pages, which is tight but potentially feasible within my available space. The Ethics Statement is non-negotiable, so I'll prioritize that first and then add the Discussion enrichment if space permits.

Now I need to figure out where to place the Ethics Statement. Looking at the document structure, Limitations appears in the discussion file, but Related Work and Conclusion come after that before the bibliography. According to the guidelines, the Ethics Statement should go after Conclusion and right before the References section.

I'll add it as a separate unnumbered section in the main.tex file between the conclusion input and the bibliography command. Actually, the cleaner approach would be to append it to the end of conclusion.tex as its own unnumbered section, which aligns with standard ACL formatting where both Limitations and Ethics Statement are standalone sections appearing before References. I need to restructure the paper layout to follow ARR format properly. The Ethics Statement should go between Conclusion and References, so I'll create a separate ethics.tex file and add it to main.tex in the right place. For the content, I'm drafting a concise statement covering the use of public benchmarks, open-source models, and the computational efficiency of the approach—keeping it to a few focused sentences.

Now I'm looking at the Director's suggestions for enriching the Discussion section. They want me to pull two key findings from the appendix: one about how token-level eval loss masks classification ability despite similar training dynamics across seeds, and another about a confound in the VOTA cross-model analysis. Let me identify exactly what needs to be moved and how to integrate these insights into the main discussion. The capability floor principle suggests that trace representations should match the model's baseline performance rather than peak performance, and the 0.50pp gap across models provides a clean measure of this since it's unaffected by tokenization differences. Moving the cross-model gap figure back to the main text would strengthen this argument, though I need to find the right placement in §4.1 without overcrowding it alongside Table 1.

The figure effectively visualizes the gap pattern across different conditions, so it makes sense to position it after the table discussion. Space-wise, a figure in two-column format takes roughly 0.15-0.25 pages, and combined with the ethics statement and discussion additions, I should have enough room if there's 0.5-1 page available. Let me start implementing this by creating the ethics section and updating the main document. I'm deciding on figure placement in the two-column ACL format—LaTeX will handle the positioning automatically with the [t] placement option, so I'll just insert the figure environment after the seed robustness section and let it flow naturally.

But wait, I realize this figure was already moved to the appendix in an earlier version, which means I'd be creating a duplicate label if I add it back to the main body. I need to remove it from the appendix instead and keep it only in the main text. Let me check what the appendix currently references—it looks like the calibration section has both figure environments, but the text that actually cited the cross-model gap figure might have been removed already. Looking more carefully at the appendix section, I need to trace through exactly what's between lines 295 and 309 to understand the full context of what needs to be moved.

19	Execution traces are increasingly used to enhance code language models, but which trace components matter for downstream tasks remains poorly understood.
20	We present the first systematic component ablation of trace representations for \emph{verdict prediction}---classifying whether a test passes or fails---across two models (Qwen-2.5-Coder-7B and DeepSeek-Coder-6.7B).
21	Our key finding is that exception events alone achieve near-perfect accuracy on Qwen (99.83\% $\pm$ 0.00, 3 seeds) and are the most effective component on DeepSeek (2/3 seeds at 99.33\%; 1 outlier at 91.09\% from LoRA initialization sensitivity), while a multi-component representation (VOTA) degrades by 14.96pp on the weaker model, confounded by training-time trace truncation.
22	We decompose the gap between full traces and compressed representations into gradient dilution (26\%) and information overload (74\%), establishing that irrelevant trace content---not training signal quality---is the primary bottleneck.
23	Component ablation reveals a two-tier diagnostic hierarchy: Tier~1 signals (exception events, assertion points) individually achieve ${\geq}$99.8\% accuracy, while Tier~2 signals (loop compression) reach only 85.6\%.
24	These results reframe verdict prediction as fault detection, where the minimal sufficient signal is a compact exception event that transfers well across model families; training stability is a secondary factor for smaller models.

1	\section{Discussion}
2	
3	Verdict prediction is fundamentally a fault detection task: the model must determine whether execution deviated from expected behavior.
4	Exception events are the most explicit signal of such deviation---structured diagnostic moments that encode the nature and location of a fault.
5	Unlike loop compressions or assertion-point values, which require the model to integrate information across multiple trace elements, exception events provide a self-contained verdict cue.
6	This explains why \texttt{exception\_only} matches or exceeds VOTA: adding non-exception trace components dilutes the model's attention on the diagnostic signal rather than providing complementary information.
7	
8	We acknowledge that exception-based verdict prediction is, at its core, fault indicator presence detection: the model learns to map the presence or absence of a structured error message to a binary label.
9	The Tier~1 accuracy of ${\geq}$99.8\% is therefore unsurprising in isolation.
10	The contribution lies in two less obvious results: (a)~adding more trace information actively \emph{hurts} performance (VOTA $<$ \texttt{exception\_only}, Table~\ref{tab:ablation}), quantifying an information density dilution effect that has not been previously measured; and (b)~this dilution is confounded by tokenizer-driven trace truncation on DeepSeek (\S\ref{sec:cross_model}), which causes the majority of VOTA training samples to exceed the context window, truncating diagnostic trace content while preserving the verdict label.
11	A regex baseline analysis sharpens this point: the strongest legitimate regex (exception type pattern-matching) achieves 93.61\%, while a format-marker heuristic reaches 99.33\% by exploiting a data formatting artifact rather than exception semantics (Appendix~\ref{sec:regex_baselines}).
12	The 6.22pp gap between regex and SFT concentrates on boundary samples where exceptions are raised but caught by \texttt{try/except}---SFT correctly classifies 6/8, confirming that the model learns to distinguish caught from uncaught exceptions rather than merely detecting exception presence.
13	
14	Additional analysis of cross-model robustness (Appendix~\ref{sec:robustness_analysis}), training dynamics (Appendix~\ref{sec:training_dynamics}), and irreducible errors (Appendix~\ref{sec:irreducible}) is provided.
15	
16	\subsection{Limitations}
17	
18	Our study has several limitations.
19	First, our primary experiments use a single dataset (591 problems from HumanEval and MBPP-sanitized); while a cross-dataset evaluation on DebugBench (\S\ref{sec:debugbench}) confirms that exception dominance generalizes to synthetically injected bugs, generalization to other languages, larger codebases, or real-world fault distributions remains untested.
20	Second, we evaluate only two models at the 7B parameter scale; the relationship between model size and trace signal utility is unexplored.
21	Third, DeepSeek \texttt{exception\_only} exhibits seed-dependent variance: 2/3 seeds achieve 99.33\% while seed 123 yields 91.09\% ($\sigma{=}4.76$pp, $n{=}3$), attributable to LoRA initialization sensitivity (fail recall = 70.5\% for the outlier vs.\ 100\% for others).
22	Qwen shows perfect seed robustness ($\sigma{=}0$, $n{=}3$).
23	Whether training stabilization techniques can eliminate DeepSeek's seed sensitivity is unexplored; other conditions use a single seed.
24	Fourth, the initial DeepSeek \texttt{full\_trace} run was invalidated by context overflow; a re-run with extended context yields 79.16\% (CI [76.80\%, 81.30\%]), 2.60pp below Qwen (Table~\ref{tab:cross_model}).
25	Fifth, the candidate solutions were generated by Qwen-2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct, which also serves as one of our evaluation models; this does not affect verdict prediction but may influence the pass/fail distribution.
26	Finally, our analysis is limited to verdict prediction; whether exception dominance extends to other classification tasks or generation tasks is an open question.

Now I have the current state. Let me plan the edits:

1. **Ethics Statement (P0)**: Create a new section after Conclusion. I'll add `\section*{Ethics Statement}` before `\bibliography{references}` in main.tex. I can either add it inline in main.tex or create a separate ethics.tex file. Let me add it inline for simplicity.

2. **Discussion enrichment**: Add D1 (training loss decoupling) and D11 (capability floor) summaries to discussion.tex, between line 12 (end of regex discussion) and line 14 (appendix references).


3. **Figure in main body**: Move fig:cross_model_gap from appendix to experiments.tex §4.1. Remove from appendix (lines 304-309) to avoid duplicate label.

Let me execute all three changes. For the Ethics Statement, I'm adding a new section to main.tex between the conclusion and bibliography that briefly notes the use of public benchmarks and open-source models without human subjects or sensitive data.

Adding the ethics statement to main.tex...

For the Discussion section, I'm incorporating analysis about training dynamics on DeepSeek showing how identical losses can mask accuracy differences, and highlighting the clean cross-model gap measurement from exception_only inputs.

Now I need to verify the appendix calibration section to see if it explicitly references the figure before moving it to experiments.tex.

Looking at the text, the appendix only references the calibration table, not the cross-model gap figure. The figure environments exist but aren't mentioned in the prose, so moving the figure to the main body won't create any dangling references in the appendix. The experiments.tex section references the appendix section but not the specific figures, so this move is clean.

For placement in the main body, I'm thinking the cross-model gap figure belongs earlier in §4.1, near where the gap is discussed—probably after the confound discussion or the per-class analysis reference. The exact source position matters less with LaTeX's [t] placement since the figure will float to the top of the column anyway.

I need to add a reference to the figure in the text itself. Looking at line 40 where the gap is explained, I could add a figure reference there, but the figure shows all conditions, not just the VOTA gap, so I need to find the right spot that matches what the caption actually illustrates.

The figure caption describes the cross-model accuracy gap across all trace conditions, so it makes sense to reference it when discussing how exception-based signals transfer consistently while VOTA varies. I'll add the reference to line 36 where I'm confirming exception events as the most effective component—that's where the figure's broader comparison becomes relevant. Then I'll place the figure environment right after that section.

Now I need to execute the edits across multiple files: adding the Ethics Statement to main.tex, incorporating the discussion summaries into discussion.tex, updating the figure reference and placement in experiments.tex, and removing the duplicate from appendix.tex. Since these are all separate files, I can handle them in parallel. But first, I should adjust the figure caption slightly since it's moving from the appendix to the main body—I'll keep the core finding about the cross-model gap while making sure the context is clear for readers encountering it earlier in the paper.

```text
Now I need to add the cross_model_gap figure to experiments.tex. I'll add a reference in the text (line 36) and the figure environment after line 51 (end of §4.1).

Let me do two edits:
1. Add "(Figure~\ref{fig:cross_model_gap})" to line 36
2. Add figure environment after line 51 (before the blank line before §4.2)
```

```text
34	Table~\ref{tab:cross_model} reveals a striking asymmetry.
35	Under \texttt{exception\_only}, Qwen achieves 99.83\% $\pm$ 0.00 across three seeds, while DeepSeek shows a bimodal pattern: seeds 42 and 456 both achieve 99.33\% (gap = 0.50pp), while seed 123 yields 91.09\% (gap = 8.74pp), attributable to suboptimal LoRA initialization (fail recall = 70.5\% vs.\ 100\% for other seeds).
36	Even the outlier seed outperforms VOTA (84.45\%) by 6.64pp, confirming exception events as the most effective component across models.
37	Under VOTA, the gap widens to 14.96pp: DeepSeek drops to 84.45\% while Qwen remains at 99.41\%.
38	Post-hoc tokenizer analysis reveals a confound: measured on the training set using each model's tokenizer, the DeepSeek tokenizer averages 2{,}626 tokens per VOTA sample versus 1{,}929 for Qwen, causing 91.7\% of DeepSeek VOTA training samples to exceed the 2{,}048-token context window.
39	The VOTA training framework preserves the verdict label but truncates the trace content (input), so the model trains with incomplete diagnostic information for the vast majority of the dataset.
40	The 14.96pp gap thus reflects both model capability differences and training-time trace truncation; the two factors cannot be disentangled in the current design.
41	However, a post-hoc group analysis provides directional evidence: partitioning DeepSeek VOTA test samples by whether their training-set counterparts exceeded the context window, intact samples ($N{=}99$) achieve 100\% accuracy while truncated samples ($N{=}1{,}091$) achieve 83.04\% (95\% CI [80.75\%, 85.24\%]; Fisher exact $p{<}0.001$), with all 185 errors concentrated in the fail class of the truncated group (fail recall $=$ 31.23\%).
42	In contrast, the \texttt{exception\_only} condition is unaffected by truncation because exception-based inputs are short enough to fit within the context window for both tokenizers, making its cross-model comparison clean.
43	Per-class analysis (Appendix~\ref{sec:per_class}) reveals the mechanism: DeepSeek VOTA achieves 100\% fail precision but only 45.43\% fail recall, systematically defaulting to \texttt{pass}---in contrast to Qwen VOTA, which achieves 100\% fail recall.
44	
45	The \texttt{no\_trace} baseline confirms that source code alone provides limited signal (75.13\% for Qwen, 73.36\% for DeepSeek), only marginally above majority-class guessing (71.51\%).
46	
47	Seed robustness diverges sharply across models.
48	Qwen \texttt{exception\_only} produces identical accuracy of 99.83\% across all three seeds ($\sigma{=}0$, $n{=}3$, exactly two errors each).
49	DeepSeek shows a bimodal pattern ($n{=}3$): seeds 42 and 456 both achieve 99.33\% (8 errors each, fail recall = 100\%), while seed 123 yields 91.09\% (fail recall = 70.5\%), consistent with LoRA initialization sensitivity on the smaller model.
50	Because the \texttt{exception\_only} test set contains 48.99\% duplicate inputs (607 unique out of 1,190; \S\ref{sec:dataset}), the reported CIs assume $n{=}1{,}190$ independent trials.
51	Under deduplication ($n{=}607$), Qwen's two errors yield 99.67\% accuracy (Wilson CI [98.81, 99.91]), confirming that the result is robust to the effective sample size.
52	
53	\subsection{Component Ablation}
54	\label{sec:ablation}
55	
56	We decompose the VOTA pipeline into individual components on Qwen-2.5-7B (seed=42).
57	Table~\ref{tab:ablation} arranges conditions into a two-tier hierarchy: Tier~1 signals (\texttt{ae\_only}, \texttt{exception\_only}) that individually achieve ${\geq}$99.8\% accuracy, and Tier~2 signals (\texttt{loop\_only}) that provide moderate improvement over the no-trace baseline.

      "content": "Table~\\ref{tab:cross_model} reveals a striking asymmetry.\nUnder \\texttt{exception\\_only}, Qwen achieves 99.83\\% $\\pm$ 0.00 across three seeds, while DeepSeek shows a bimodal pattern: seeds 42 and 456 both achieve 99.33\\% (gap = 0.50pp), while seed 123 yields 91.09\\% (gap = 8.74pp), attributable to suboptimal LoRA initialization (fail recall = 70.5\\% vs.\\ 100\\% for other seeds).\nEven the outlier seed outperforms VOTA (84.45\\%) by 6.64pp, confirming exception events as the most effective component across models.\nUnder VOTA, the gap widens to 14.96pp: DeepSeek drops to 84.45\\% while Qwen remains at 99.41\\%.\nPost-hoc tokenizer analysis reveals a confound: measured on the training set using each model's tokenizer, the DeepSeek tokenizer averages 2{,}626 tokens per VOTA sample versus 1{,}929 for Qwen, causing 91.7\\% of DeepSeek VOTA training samples to exceed the 2{,}048-token context window.\nThe VOTA training framework preserves the verdict label but truncates the trace content (input), so the model trains with incomplete diagnostic information for the vast majority of the dataset.\nThe 14.96pp gap thus reflects both model capability differences and training-time trace truncation; the two factors cannot be disentangled in the current design.\nHowever, a post-hoc group analysis provides directional evidence: partitioning DeepSeek VOTA test samples by whether their training-set counterparts exceeded the context window, intact samples ($N{=}99$) achieve 100\\% accuracy while truncated samples ($N{=}1{,}091$) achieve 83.04\\% (95\\% CI [80.75\\%, 85.24\\%]; Fisher exact $p{<}0.001$), with all 185 errors concentrated in the fail class of the truncated group (fail recall $=$ 31.23\\%).\nIn contrast, the \\texttt{exception\\_only} condition is unaffected by truncation because exception-based inputs are short enough to fit within the context window for both tokenizers, making its cross-model comparison clean.\nPer-class analysis (Appendix~\\ref{sec:per_class}) reveals the mechanism: DeepSeek VOTA achieves 100\\% fail precision but only 45.43\\% fail recall, systematically defaulting to \\texttt{pass}---in contrast to Qwen VOTA, which achieves 100\\% fail recall.\n\nThe \\texttt{no\\_trace} baseline confirms that source code alone provides limited signal (75.13\\% for Qwen, 73.36\\% for DeepSeek), only marginally above majority-class guessing (71.51\\%).\n\nSeed robustness diverges sharply across models.\nQwen \\texttt{exception\\_only} produces identical accuracy of 99.83\\% across all three seeds ($\\sigma{=}0$, $n{=}3$, exactly two errors each).\nDeepSeek shows a bimodal pattern ($n{=}3$): seeds 42 and 456 both achieve 99.33\\% (8 errors each, fail recall = 100\\%), while seed 123 yields 91.09\\% (fail recall = 70.5\\%), consistent with LoRA initialization sensitivity on the smaller model.\nBecause the \\texttt{exception\\_only} test set contains 48.99\\% duplicate inputs (607 unique out of 1,190; \\S\\ref{sec:dataset}), the reported CIs assume $n{=}1{,}190$ independent trials.\nUnder deduplication ($n{=}607$), Qwen's two errors yield 99.67\\% accuracy (Wilson CI [98.81, 99.91]), confirming that the result is robust to the effective sample size.\n\n\\subsection{Component Ablation}\n\\label{sec:ablation}\n\nWe decompose the VOTA pipeline into individual components on Qwen-2.5-7B (seed=42).\nTable~\\ref{tab:ablation} arranges conditions into a two-tier hierarchy: Tier~1 signals (\\texttt{ae\\_only}, \\texttt{exception\\_only}) that individually achieve ${\\geq}$99.8\\% accuracy, and Tier~2 signals (\\texttt{loop\\_only}) that provide moderate improvement over the no-trace baseline.\n",

```text
Looking at the page structure:
- Page 8: Contains "Ethics Statement" and "References" — both on page 8
- Page 9: References continued (author names)
- Page 10: More references + start of appendix text
- Page 11: Appendix tables

So the main body (through Conclusion + Ethics Statement) fits on pages 1-8, with References also starting on page 8. Total is 15 pages.

The main body is still ≤8 pages. The Ethics Statement and References share page 8, which is within the EMNLP limit (8 pages for main body, references unlimited).


Let me verify the page count rules for ARR/EMNLP. The 8-page limit covers the abstract through conclusion, while the Limitations and Ethics Statement sections don't count toward that limit since they come after the main body. References and appendices are always unlimited.

Looking at this specific paper, the Limitations section is embedded within the Discussion rather than appearing separately afterward, which means it's actually part of the main 8-page count. Checking page 8, I can see the Ethics Statement and References begin there, suggesting the main body text wraps up around page 7.5, comfortably within the limit. I'm within the 8-page limit as-is, so I'll leave the Limitations section where it is inside Discussion rather than restructuring it now—the Director can decide on placement if needed. Let me check for any undefined references or compilation warnings.

[Director 指令] 两件事：

**1. ARR Checklist 素材已就绪**
Agent 已写入 `artifacts/arr_checklist_raw.md` 并注册。覆盖：训练硬件+时长、LoRA 超参、数据集 split、种子策略、评估指标定义、代码/数据可用性声明。请读取并整合为 ARR 格式的 supplementary checklist。

**2. 批准 Limitations 移出 Discussion**
同意将 Limitations 从 §5.1 移为独立 `\section*{Limitations}`（不计入 8 页限制）。释放的空间可以让 Discussion 更从容，或留给后续 Reviewer 修改的 buffer。请执行。

这次不用验证引用。

1	\section{Discussion}
2	
3	Verdict prediction is fundamentally a fault detection task: the model must determine whether execution deviated from expected behavior.
4	Exception events are the most explicit signal of such deviation---structured diagnostic moments that encode the nature and location of a fault.
5	Unlike loop compressions or assertion-point values, which require the model to integrate information across multiple trace elements, exception events provide a self-contained verdict cue.
6	This explains why \texttt{exception\_only} matches or exceeds VOTA: adding non-exception trace components dilutes the model's attention on the diagnostic signal rather than providing complementary information.
7	
8	We acknowledge that exception-based verdict prediction is, at its core, fault indicator presence detection: the model learns to map the presence or absence of a structured error message to a binary label.
9	The Tier~1 accuracy of ${\geq}$99.8\% is therefore unsurprising in isolation.
10	The contribution lies in two less obvious results: (a)~adding more trace information actively \emph{hurts} performance (VOTA $<$ \texttt{exception\_only}, Table~\ref{tab:ablation}), quantifying an information density dilution effect that has not been previously measured; and (b)~this dilution is confounded by tokenizer-driven trace truncation on DeepSeek (\S\ref{sec:cross_model}), which causes the majority of VOTA training samples to exceed the context window, truncating diagnostic trace content while preserving the verdict label.
11	A regex baseline analysis sharpens this point: the strongest legitimate regex (exception type pattern-matching) achieves 93.61\%, while a format-marker heuristic reaches 99.33\% by exploiting a data formatting artifact rather than exception semantics (Appendix~\ref{sec:regex_baselines}).
12	The 6.22pp gap between regex and SFT concentrates on boundary samples where exceptions are raised but caught by \texttt{try/except}---SFT correctly classifies 6/8, confirming that the model learns to distinguish caught from uncaught exceptions rather than merely detecting exception presence.
13	
14	Training dynamics further illustrate the complexity beneath surface-level metrics: on DeepSeek, two seeds converge to nearly identical final training losses (0.122 vs.\ 0.123) yet differ by 8.24pp in accuracy, demonstrating that token-level loss can mask fundamental differences in sample-level classification ability (Appendix~\ref{sec:training_dynamics}).
15	The \texttt{exception\_only} 0.50pp cross-model gap---unaffected by truncation since inputs average ${\sim}$200 tokens---provides a clean measure of model capability differences, suggesting a design principle: trace representations should match the model capability floor, not the ceiling (Appendix~\ref{sec:robustness_analysis}).
16	Additional analysis of irreducible errors is in Appendix~\ref{sec:irreducible}.
17	
18	\subsection{Limitations}
19	
20	Our study has several limitations.
21	First, our primary experiments use a single dataset (591 problems from HumanEval and MBPP-sanitized); while a cross-dataset evaluation on DebugBench (\S\ref{sec:debugbench}) confirms that exception dominance generalizes to synthetically injected bugs, generalization to other languages, larger codebases, or real-world fault distributions remains untested.
22	Second, we evaluate only two models at the 7B parameter scale; the relationship between model size and trace signal utility is unexplored.
23	Third, DeepSeek \texttt{exception\_only} exhibits seed-dependent variance: 2/3 seeds achieve 99.33\% while seed 123 yields 91.09\% ($\sigma{=}4.76$pp, $n{=}3$), attributable to LoRA initialization sensitivity (fail recall = 70.5\% for the outlier vs.\ 100\% for others).
24	Qwen shows perfect seed robustness ($\sigma{=}0$, $n{=}3$).
25	Whether training stabilization techniques can eliminate DeepSeek's seed sensitivity is unexplored; other conditions use a single seed.
26	Fourth, the initial DeepSeek \texttt{full\_trace} run was invalidated by context overflow; a re-run with extended context yields 79.16\% (CI [76.80\%, 81.30\%]), 2.60pp below Qwen (Table~\ref{tab:cross_model}).
27	Fifth, the candidate solutions were generated by Qwen-2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct, which also serves as one of our evaluation models; this does not affect verdict prediction but may influence the pass/fail distribution.
28	Finally, our analysis is limited to verdict prediction; whether exception dominance extends to other classification tasks or generation tasks is an open question.

Two tasks:

1. **ARR Checklist**: Read the raw materials and create a formatted ARR reproducibility checklist as supplementary material.

2. **Move Limitations out of Discussion**: Move `\subsection{Limitations}` from discussion.tex to a standalone `\section*{Limitations}` section in main.tex, after `\input{conclusion}` and before `\section*{Ethics Statement}`.

Let me handle both.

**Task 1: ARR Checklist**

I need to create a LaTeX file for the ARR reproducibility checklist. The ARR checklist is typically submitted as supplementary material. It has a specific format with Yes/No/NA answers for each item.


I'm looking at the current ACL Responsible NLP Research Checklist format with sections covering limitations, potential risks, computational experiments (infrastructure, setup, hyperparameters, results), and data. I'll create an `arr_checklist.tex` file structured as supplementary material that can be included in the paper.

Now I need to handle the limitations section—I'll extract it from discussion.tex and create a separate `limitations.tex` file, then input it in main.tex between the conclusion and ethics statement. While building the checklist, I'm noticing some discrepancies between the raw materials and what's documented in the paper appendix, like the warmup ratio and learning rate scheduler settings, which I should flag. I'm noticing serious inconsistencies between the paper's training details and the raw materials—gradient accumulation is 8 vs 1, warmup ratio is 0.1 vs 0.03, and the scheduler is linear decay vs cosine. The raw materials themselves acknowledge uncertainty about exact values, so I'll treat the paper's reviewed appendix as authoritative while flagging these discrepancies to the Director. I'm also seeing conflicting information about GPU allocation—the raw materials mention two consumer GPUs totaling 48GB VRAM, but the paper references an RTX PRO 6.

For the ARR checklist, I need to create a supplementary PDF document since the Director requested it in that format, even though the actual submission will be filled out in OpenReview. Let me build the checklist now and then move on to the Limitations section.

I'll start by removing the Limitations subsection from discussion.tex and moving it to main.tex as its own section, placing it between the conclusion and Ethics Statement. Then I'll create the ARR checklist file with the standard numbered format and Yes/No/NA responses with justifications.

Good, Limitations moved. Now create the ARR checklist. I'll create it as a LaTeX file in the paper directory.

I need to note the discrepancies I found between the raw materials and the paper appendix:
- Warmup ratio: raw=0.03 vs paper=0.1
- LR scheduler: raw=cosine vs paper=linear decay
- Gradient accumulation: raw=1 vs paper=8
- GPU: raw=2× consumer/prosumer GPUs (~48GB) vs paper=1× RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell (94GB)

I'll use the paper's values and flag these discrepancies.


Now I'm looking at the ARR checklist structure—it covers author responsibilities, scientific artifacts, computational experiments, and human annotations. I need to pull the exact ACL 2024 Responsible NLP Research format and create a comprehensive standalone LaTeX document.

Writing the checklist template...

Limitations and Risks}\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item \\textbf{Did you discuss the limitations of your work?} \\\\\n\\textit{Yes.} A dedicated Limitations section discusses: single-dataset scope, single model scale (7B), seed-dependent variance on DeepSeek, the invalidated full\\_trace run, generator--evaluator overlap, and task scope limited to verdict prediction.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Did you discuss any potential risks of your work?} \\\\\n\\textit{Yes.} The Ethics Statement notes that the work uses public benchmarks, involves no human subjects, and has minimal environmental impact. Verdict prediction is a developer-facing tool with no direct end-user impact.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\subsection*{B. Did you use or create scientific artifacts?}\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item \\textbf{Did you cite the creators of artifacts you used?} \\\\\n\\textit{Yes.} HumanEval \\cite{chen2021evaluating}, MBPP-sanitized \\cite{austin2021program}, DebugBench \\cite{tian2024debugbench}, Qwen-2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct \\cite{qwen2025coder}, DeepSeek-Coder-6.7B-Instruct \\cite{deepseek2024coder}, LoRA \\cite{hu2022lora}, and TRL SFTTrainer are all cited.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Did you discuss the license or terms for use and/or distribution of any artifacts?} \\\\\n\\textit{Partial.} All base models and datasets are publicly available. HumanEval is released under MIT license; MBPP under CC-BY-4.0; DebugBench under MIT. Model licenses: Qwen-2.5-Coder under Apache 2.0; DeepSeek-Coder under the DeepSeek License.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Did you discuss if your use of existing artifacts was consistent with their intended use?} \\\\\n\\textit{Yes.} HumanEval and MBPP are standard code generation benchmarks; we use their canonical test cases for verdict evaluation, consistent with their evaluation purpose.

<details><summary>Logged reasoning block</summary>

```text
The page structure:
- Page 7: Conclusion starts (section header)
- Page 8: Limitations heading + References (already on page 8)

So the main body (through Conclusion) ends on page 7! That means the main body is only ~7 pages now, and Limitations + Ethics Statement + References are on page 8+. Since Limitations and Ethics Statement are `\section*{}` (unnumbered, post-body), they don't count toward the 8-page limit.

This freed up about 1 page of main body space (was 8 pages, now ~7 pages of main body content). 

I've got some breathing room now for reviewer feedback or future content. All references check out, but I'm noticing some hyperparameter mismatches between the source materials and what's in the paper—I should flag those. Let me document this in the checklist and notify the Director.

[Director 指令] [Patch] 超参数确认 + minor fix

Reviewer 验证结论：**Appendix 全部正确**（与代码/checkpoint 匹配），raw materials 有误。

**请确认并执行：**
1. **验证 arr_checklist.tex** — 你之前说"使用论文值"，请逐项确认最终 tex 中 warmup ratio=0.1, lr_scheduler=linear, gradient_accum=8, GPU=1× RTX PRO 6000 确实是这些值。如有遗漏修正。
2. **GPU 显存 minor fix** — Appendix 写 94GB，实际 RTX PRO 6000 为 ~96GB。请将 Appendix 和 Checklist 中的 94GB 统一改为 96GB。

Good. I found the two locations with "94\,GB VRAM":
1. appendix.tex line 68: `Hardware & 1$\times$ RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell (94\,GB VRAM) \\`
2. arr_checklist.tex line 47: `\item Hardware: 1$\times$ RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell (94\,GB VRAM).`

I need to change both to 96GB.

Also, the checklist verification:


- warmup ratio=0.1 ✅ (line 52: "warmup ratio (0.1)")
- lr_scheduler=linear ✅ (line 52: "LR scheduler (linear decay)")
- gradient_accum=8 ✅ (line 52: "gradient accumulation steps (8)")
- GPU=1× RTX PRO 6000 ✅ (line 47, just needs 94→96)

All the parameters check out—I just need to make those two VRAM edits across both files.

Verdict prediction is a developer-facing tool with no direct end-user impact.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\subsection*{B. Did you use or create scientific artifacts?}\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item \\textbf{Did you cite the creators of artifacts you used?} \\\\\n\\textit{Yes.} HumanEval \\cite{chen2021evaluating}, MBPP-sanitized \\cite{austin2021program}, DebugBench \\cite{tian2024debugbench}, Qwen-2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct \\cite{qwen2025coder}, DeepSeek-Coder-6.7B-Instruct \\cite{deepseek2024coder}, LoRA \\cite{hu2022lora}, and TRL SFTTrainer are all cited.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Did you discuss the license or terms for use and/or distribution of any artifacts?} \\\\\n\\textit{Partial.} All base models and datasets are publicly available. HumanEval is released under MIT license; MBPP under CC-BY-4.0; DebugBench under MIT. Model licenses: Qwen-2.5-Coder under Apache 2.0; DeepSeek-Coder under the DeepSeek License.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Did you discuss if your use of existing artifacts was consistent with their intended use?} \\\\\n\\textit{Yes.} HumanEval and MBPP are standard code generation benchmarks; we use their canonical test cases for verdict evaluation, consistent with their evaluation purpose. DebugBench is designed for debugging evaluation.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Did you discuss the steps taken to check whether the data contains any information that names or uniquely identifies individual people or offensive content?} \\\\\n\\textit{N/A.} All datasets contain only programming problems and solutions with no personal information.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\subsection*{C. Computational Experiments}\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item \\textbf{Did you report the number of parameters in the models used, the total computational budget, and computing infrastructure?} \\\\\n\\textit{Yes.}\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Models: Qwen-2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct (7B parameters), DeepSeek-Coder-6.7B-Instruct (6.7B parameters). Only LoRA adapters are trained (rank=16, $\\alpha$=32, targeting all linear layers).\n\\item Hardware: 1$\\times$ RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell (94\\,GB VRAM).\n\\item Total compute: ${\\sim}$20 GPU-hours across all conditions and seeds. Per-condition training time ranges from 0.5h (no\\_trace) to 2.5h (VOTA). See Appendix~B for per-condition wall-clock times.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\item \\textbf{Did you report all hyperparameters?} \\\\\n\\textit{Yes.} Appendix~B (Table~5) reports: LoRA rank (16), alpha (32), dropout (0.05), target modules (all linear layers), epochs (3), per-device batch size (4), gradient accumulation steps (8), effective batch size (32), learning rate ($2 \\times 10^{-4}$), LR scheduler (linear decay), warmup ratio (0.1), weight decay (0.01), max sequence length (2,048 tokens).\n\n\\item \\textbf{Did you report descriptive statistics about your results?} \\\\\n\\textit{Yes.} All accuracy values include Wilson 95\\% confidence intervals. Pairwise comparisons use paired bootstrap resampling ($B{=}10{,}000$, seed=42) with reported $p$-values. Seed robustness is evaluated with 3 seeds for key conditions, reporting mean $\\pm$ std.\n\n\\item \\textbf{If you used existing packages, did you report the implementation, model, and their versions?} \\\\\n\\textit{Yes.} HuggingFace TRL SFTTrainer with LoRA via PEFT. Base model identifiers: \\texttt{Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct} and \\texttt{deepseek-ai/deepseek-coder-6.7b-instruct}.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\subsection*{D. Human Annotations}\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item \\textbf{Did you use human annotators?} \\\\\n\\textit{No.} All labels (pass/fail) are derived from automated test execution. No human annotation was involved.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\subsection*{E. Data and Code Availability}\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item \\textbf{Code}: Training, evaluation, and trace preprocessing scripts will be released upon acceptance.\n\\item \\textbf{Data}: Execution traces, VOTA-compressed traces, and train/test splits will be released. Raw traces are generated deterministically from publicly available benchmarks using Python \\texttt{sys.settrace}.\n\\item \\textbf{Models}: LoRA adapters for all conditions will be released on HuggingFace.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\subsection*{F. Reproducibility Summary}\n\n\\begin{table}[h]\n\\centering\n\\small\n\\begin{tabular}{lc}\n\\toprule\n\\textbf{Item} & \\textbf{Status} \\\\\n\\midrule\nAll hyperparameters reported & Yes \\\\\nRandom seeds specified & Yes (42, 123, 456) \\\\\nError bars / CIs reported & Yes (Wilson 95\\% CI) \\\\\nStatistical tests reported & Yes (bootstrap, McNemar) \\\\\nComputing infrastructure reported & Yes \\\\\nTraining time reported & Yes \\\\\nCode release planned & Yes \\\\\nData release planned & Yes \\\\\nModel release planned & Yes \\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\n\n\\bibliography{references}\n\n\\end{document}\n",

This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The summary below covers the earlier portion of the conversation.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   This is a Paper Agent session for the `trace-verdict-study` project, executing patches for an EMNLP 2026 Main paper (ARR May 25, 2026 deadline). The session covered four Director instructions:
   
   - **D042 Page Restructure**: Compress paper from ~13 to ≤8 pages by moving analysis sections to appendix, compressing Discussion, keeping cross-references.
   - **ARR Compliance + Improvements**: Add mandatory Ethics Statement, create ARR Reproducibility Checklist, enrich Discussion with D1/D11 summaries from appendix, move cross-model gap figure into main body.
   - **Limitations Restructure + Checklist Creation**: Move Limitations from Discussion subsection to standalone `\section*{Limitations}` (not counting toward page limit), create formatted ARR checklist from raw materials.
   - **Hyperparameter Confirmation + GPU Fix**: Verify checklist uses correct paper values, fix GPU VRAM from 94GB to 96GB.

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - VOTA (Verdict-Oriented Trace Abstraction): exception events + assertion-point + loop compression
   - Verdict prediction: binary pass/fail classification via SFT on trace data
   - Two models: Qwen-2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct vs DeepSeek-Coder-6.7B-Instruct
   - Component ablation hierarchy: Tier 1 (exception_only 99.83%, ae_only 99.92%) vs Tier 2 (loop_only 85.63%)
   - Information density decomposition: gradient dilution (26%) vs information overload (74%)
   - VOTA cross-model gap (14.96pp) confounded by tokenizer truncation + capability differences
   - Exception_only cross-model gap (0.50pp) = clean capability measure (~200 tokens, no truncation)
   - Regex baseline: B4 legitimate=93.61% (p<0.001 vs SFT), B5 format marker=99.33% (p=0.041 vs SFT)
   - Training loss decoupling: seeds with loss 0.122≈0.123 differ by 8.24pp accuracy
   - ARR submission requirements: Ethics Statement, Limitations section, Reproducibility Checklist
   - EMNLP page limits: 8 pages main body, unlimited references/appendix/limitations/ethics

3. Files and Code Sections:

   - **`/home/ubuntu/.agent-ml-research-idea_gen_0509_4/projects/trace-verdict-study/docs/paper/main.tex`**
     - Central document structure file. Modified to add `\section*{Limitations}` and `\section*{Ethics Statement}` between `\input{conclusion}` and `\bibliography{references}`.
     - Current structure: \input{introduction/method/experiments/discussion/related_work/conclusion} → \section*{Limitations} → \section*{Ethics Statement} → \bibliography → \appendix → \input{appendix}

   - **`/home/ubuntu/.agent-ml-research-idea_gen_0509_4/projects/trace-verdict-study/docs/paper/experiments.tex`**
     - Largest file, contains all experimental results. Three sections compressed in D042:
     - §4.4 Trace Length Ablation: 34 lines → 3 lines + `Appendix~\ref{sec:trace_length_full}`
     - §4.5 Calibration: 45 lines → 2 lines + `Appendix~\ref{sec:calibration_full}`
     - §4.6 DebugBench: 33 lines → 3 lines + `Appendix~\ref{sec:debugbench_full}`
     - Added `Figure~\ref{fig:cross_model_gap}` reference in §4.1 line 36 + figure environment after line 51
     - §4.1-4.3 (Cross-Model, Component Ablation, Information Density) preserved intact
     - Regex baseline already present: Table 2 row (line 75) + §4.2 text (lines 90-91)
     - Current file is ~140 lines (was 226 before D042)

   - **`/home/ubuntu/.agent-ml-research-idea_gen_0509_4/projects/trace-verdict-study/docs/paper/discussion.tex`**
     - Rewritten in D042, then enriched and trimmed. Current state (~16 lines):
     - Para 1 (lines 3-6): Why exception events dominate (fault detection framing)
     - Para 2 (lines 8-12): Acknowledgment of near-circularity + two contributions (dilution + truncation confound) + regex baseline analysis
     - Para 3 (lines 14-16): D1 training dynamics (loss decoupling) + D11 capability floor principle + irreducible errors ref
     - Limitations REMOVED (moved to main.tex as standalone section)

   - **`/home/ubuntu/.agent-ml-research-idea_gen_0509_4/projects/trace-verdict-study/docs/paper/appendix.tex`**
     - Expanded significantly. Now contains:
     - Original: Per-Class (A), Training Details (B), VOTA Examples (C), Full Results (D), Irreducible Samples (E)
     - Added in D042: Trace Length Ablation (F), Calibration Analysis (G), DebugBench (H), Cross-Model Robustness (I), Training Dynamics (J)
     - Also has: Regex Baseline Analysis section (added before D042)
     - fig:cross_model_gap REMOVED (moved to main body experiments.tex)
     - GPU VRAM fixed: 94GB → 96GB (line 68)

   - **`/home/ubuntu/.agent-ml-research-idea_gen_0509_4/projects/trace-verdict-study/docs/paper/conclusion.tex`**
     - DebugBench paragraph compressed from 2 sentences to 1 sentence
     - Line 20: "A cross-dataset evaluation on DebugBench (\S\ref{sec:debugbench}) confirms that the exception dominance ranking generalizes (\texttt{exception\_only}: 100\%, $N{=}426$), though narrow baseline margins reflect the structural distinctiveness of synthetically injected bugs."

   - **`/home/ubuntu/.agent-ml-research-idea_gen_0509_4/projects/trace-verdict-study/docs/paper/arr_checklist.tex`** (NEW)
     - ARR Reproducibility Checklist as supplementary material
     - 6 sections: Limitations/Risks, Scientific Artifacts, Computational Experiments, Human Annotations, Data/Code Availability, Reproducibility Summary
     - All hyperparameters verified against paper appendix: warmup=0.1, lr=linear decay, grad_accum=8, batch=4, effective_batch=32
     - GPU: 1× RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell (96GB VRAM)
     - Registered as artifact art_20260516_c5727a

   - **`/home/ubuntu/.agent-ml-research-idea_gen_0509_4/projects/trace-verdict-study/docs/paper/introduction.tex`** — Read but not modified in this session
   - **`/home/ubuntu/.agent-ml-research-idea_gen_0509_4/projects/trace-verdict-study/docs/paper/method.tex`** — Read but not modified in this session
   - **`/home/ubuntu/.agent-ml-research-idea_gen_0509_4/projects/trace-verdict-study/docs/paper/related_work.tex`** — Read but not modified in this session

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **paper_compile_and_check MCP tool UTF-8 error**: `'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0xa7` — occurred twice. Worked around by compiling directly with `latexmk -pdf -interaction=nonstopmode main.tex` via Bash.
   - **experiments.tex "File has been modified since read"**: Edit failed because the file was modified by another process between read and edit. Fixed by re-reading the file and retrying the edit.
   - **System reminders about main_agent_post_to_director**: Received multiple false positive system reminders claiming I didn't report to Director. These use the wrong tool name (main_agent_post_to_director vs paper_agent_post_to_director). Correctly ignored each time — I had already reported via the correct tool.
   - **Hyperparameter discrepancies**: arr_checklist_raw.md had wrong values (warmup 0.03, cosine lr, grad_accum 1, 2× GPUs). Director confirmed paper appendix is correct. Checklist was already using paper values, no fix needed.
   - **GPU VRAM 94→96GB**: Minor factual error in appendix and checklist. Fixed both files with simple Edit.

5. Problem Solving:
   - **Page count optimization**: Successfully compressed from ~13 pages to exactly 8 pages main body through systematic section compression and appendix migration. Later freed additional ~1 page by moving Limitations to standalone post-body section.
   - **Cross-reference integrity**: Maintained all cross-references when moving content between main body and appendix. Labels like sec:trace_length (main body), sec:trace_length_full (appendix) coexist correctly. Removed duplicate fig:cross_model_gap label when moving figure from appendix to main body.
   - **Stale instruction handling**: Correctly identified that Director's "three new results" instruction was stale — all three were already integrated. Reported status rather than making duplicate changes.
   - **Consistency checks**: Ran check_paper_consistency after each batch of edits (0 critical each time). Two warnings about orphan bib keys (spiess2025calibration, yang2024generalization) are false positives — citations exist in appendix which the tool doesn't scan.

6. All user messages:
   - "Continue from where you left off." (initial session resumption, triggering D042 execution)
   - "Tool loaded." (after ToolSearch for paper_compile_and_check + check_paper_consistency)
   - "Continue from where you left off." (after D042 completion and Director report)
   - "[Director 指令] 页面重组确认收到，8 页达标。几个状态同步：Round 4 已提交、DeepSeek v3 复现解决、I9 fig1 Worker 处理中"
   - "Continue from where you left off." (×3, no action needed)
   - "[系统提醒]...main_agent_post_to_director..." (false positive, ×4, correctly ignored)
   - "[Director 指令] [Patch] 三组新结果需要整合进初稿" — DebugBench, Regex Baseline, Trace Length Ablation (all already integrated)
   - "Continue from where you left off." (after reporting all already integrated)
   - "[Director 指令] [Patch] ARR 合规 + 改进建议" — P0 Ethics Statement, P0 ARR Checklist, Discussion enrichment suggestions, figure suggestion
   - "Continue from where you left off." (×2)
   - "[Director 指令] 两件事：ARR Checklist 素材已就绪 + 批准 Limitations 移出 Discussion"
   - "Tool loaded." (after ToolSearch for register_artifact)
   - "Continue from where you left off." (×1)
   - "[Director 指令] [Patch] 超参数确认 + minor fix" — Appendix confirmed correct, fix 94→96GB
   - "CRITICAL: Respond with TEXT ONLY..." (summary request)

7. Pending Tasks:
   - **Round 4 review results**: Waiting for Reviewer feedback (submitted on pre-restructure version, feedback still applicable)
   - **ae_only 3-seed data**: Seeds 123/456 running on GPU, will need Table update when complete
   - **I9 fig1 modification**: "truncate 2048" → "up to 2048 tok" in figure image file (Worker handling, Director will notify)
   - **Post all patches**: Submit next Reviewer round when Director instructs
   - **Step 5e three-piece suite**: After convergence — paper-visual-review → verify_references → check_provenance_completeness (not yet triggered)

8. Current Work:
   The most recent completed task was the hyperparameter confirmation + GPU VRAM fix (Director instruction: "超参数确认 + minor fix"). I verified all four checklist values (warmup=0.1, lr=linear decay, grad_accum=8, GPU=RTX PRO 6000) were correct in arr_checklist.tex, then fixed 94GB→96GB in both appendix.tex and arr_checklist.tex. Reported to Director via paper_agent_post_to_director.

   Current paper state:
   - 15 total pages (main body ~7 pages + Limitations/Ethics/References on page 8+ + appendix)
   - ~1 page buffer available in main body
   - All edits compiled cleanly, 0 undefined references
   - Waiting for Director's next instruction (Round 4 review results, ae_only data, or I9 fig1 completion)

9. Optional Next Step:
   No immediate action required. The paper is in a stable state waiting for external inputs:
   - Round 4 Reviewer feedback
   - ae_only 3-seed results
   - I9 fig1 image fix completion notification
   
   When any of these arrive via Director instruction, execute the corresponding patch.

If you need specific details from before compaction (like exact code snippets, error messages, or content you generated), read the full transcript at: /home/ubuntu/.claude-account-1/projects/-home-ubuntu--agent-ml-research-idea-gen-0509-4-projects-trace-verdict-study--claude-sessions-paper-agent-59e8a27f/3969c155-5e41-4fa0-be8c-9d608ef3a42c.jsonl
Continue the conversation from where it left off without asking the user any further questions. Resume directly — do not acknowledge the summary, do not recap what was happening, do not preface with "I'll continue" or similar. Pick up the last task as if the break never happened.

Limitations and Risks}\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item \\textbf{Did you discuss the limitations of your work?} \\\\\n\\textit{Yes.} A dedicated Limitations section discusses: single-dataset scope, single model scale (7B), seed-dependent variance on DeepSeek, the invalidated full\\_trace run, generator--evaluator overlap, and task scope limited to verdict prediction.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Did you discuss any potential risks of your work?} \\\\\n\\textit{Yes.} The Ethics Statement notes that the work uses public benchmarks, involves no human subjects, and has minimal environmental impact. Verdict prediction is a developer-facing tool with no direct end-user impact.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\subsection*{B. Did you use or create scientific artifacts?}\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item \\textbf{Did you cite the creators of artifacts you used?} \\\\\n\\textit{Yes.} HumanEval \\cite{chen2021evaluating}, MBPP-sanitized \\cite{austin2021program}, DebugBench \\cite{tian2024debugbench}, Qwen-2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct \\cite{qwen2025coder}, DeepSeek-Coder-6.7B-Instruct \\cite{deepseek2024coder}, LoRA \\cite{hu2022lora}, and TRL SFTTrainer are all cited.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Did you discuss the license or terms for use and/or distribution of any artifacts?} \\\\\n\\textit{Partial.} All base models and datasets are publicly available. HumanEval is released under MIT license; MBPP under CC-BY-4.0; DebugBench under MIT. Model licenses: Qwen-2.5-Coder under Apache 2.0; DeepSeek-Coder under the DeepSeek License.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Did you discuss if your use of existing artifacts was consistent with their intended use?} \\\\\n\\textit{Yes.} HumanEval and MBPP are standard code generation benchmarks; we use their canonical test cases for verdict evaluation, consistent with their evaluation purpose. DebugBench is designed for debugging evaluation.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Did you discuss the steps taken to check whether the data contains any information that names or uniquely identifies individual people or offensive content?} \\\\\n\\textit{N/A.} All datasets contain only programming problems and solutions with no personal information.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\subsection*{C. Computational Experiments}\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item \\textbf{Did you report the number of parameters in the models used, the total computational budget, and computing infrastructure?} \\\\\n\\textit{Yes.}\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Models: Qwen-2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct (7B parameters), DeepSeek-Coder-6.7B-Instruct (6.7B parameters). Only LoRA adapters are trained (rank=16, $\\alpha$=32, targeting all linear layers).\n\\item Hardware: 1$\\times$ RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell (96\\,GB VRAM).\n\\item Total compute: ${\\sim}$20 GPU-hours across all conditions and seeds. Per-condition training time ranges from 0.5h (no\\_trace) to 2.5h (VOTA). See Appendix~B for per-condition wall-clock times.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\item \\textbf{Did you report all hyperparameters?} \\\\\n\\textit{Yes.} Appendix~B (Table~5) reports: LoRA rank (16), alpha (32), dropout (0.05), target modules (all linear layers), epochs (3), per-device batch size (4), gradient accumulation steps (8), effective batch size (32), learning rate ($2 \\times 10^{-4}$), LR scheduler (linear decay), warmup ratio (0.1), weight decay (0.01), max sequence length (2,048 tokens).\n\n\\item \\textbf{Did you report descriptive statistics about your results?} \\\\\n\\textit{Yes.} All accuracy values include Wilson 95\\% confidence intervals. Pairwise comparisons use paired bootstrap resampling ($B{=}10{,}000$, seed=42) with reported $p$-values. Seed robustness is evaluated with 3 seeds for key conditions, reporting mean $\\pm$ std.\n\n\\item \\textbf{If you used existing packages, did you report the implementation, model, and their versions?} \\\\\n\\textit{Yes.} HuggingFace TRL SFTTrainer with LoRA via PEFT. Base model identifiers: \\texttt{Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct} and \\texttt{deepseek-ai/deepseek-coder-6.7b-instruct}.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\subsection*{D. Human Annotations}\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item \\textbf{Did you use human annotators?} \\\\\n\\textit{No.} All labels (pass/fail) are derived from automated test execution. No human annotation was involved.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\subsection*{E. Data and Code Availability}\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item \\textbf{Code}: Training, evaluation, and trace preprocessing scripts will be released upon acceptance.\n\\item \\textbf{Data}: Execution traces, VOTA-compressed traces, and train/test splits will be released. Raw traces are generated deterministically from publicly available benchmarks using Python \\texttt{sys.settrace}.\n\\item \\textbf{Models}: LoRA adapters for all conditions will be released on HuggingFace.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\subsection*{F.

        "content": "\\section{Discussion}\n\nVerdict prediction is fundamentally a fault detection task: the model must determine whether execution deviated from expected behavior.\nException events are the most explicit signal of such deviation---structured diagnostic moments that encode the nature and location of a fault.\nUnlike loop compressions or assertion-point values, which require the model to integrate information across multiple trace elements, exception events provide a self-contained verdict cue.\nThis explains why \\texttt{exception\\_only} matches or exceeds VOTA: adding non-exception trace components dilutes the model's attention on the diagnostic signal rather than providing complementary information.\n\nWe acknowledge that exception-based verdict prediction is, at its core, fault indicator presence detection: the model learns to map the presence or absence of a structured error message to a binary label.\nThe Tier~1 accuracy of ${\\geq}$99.8\\% is therefore unsurprising in isolation.\nThe contribution lies in two less obvious results: (a)~adding more trace information actively \\emph{hurts} performance (VOTA $<$ \\texttt{exception\\_only}, Table~\\ref{tab:ablation}), quantifying an information density dilution effect that has not been previously measured; and (b)~this dilution is confounded by tokenizer-driven trace truncation on DeepSeek (\\S\\ref{sec:cross_model}), which causes the majority of VOTA training samples to exceed the context window, truncating diagnostic trace content while preserving the verdict label.\nA regex baseline analysis sharpens this point: the strongest legitimate regex (exception type pattern-matching) achieves 93.61\\%, while a format-marker heuristic reaches 99.33\\% by exploiting a data formatting artifact rather than exception semantics (Appendix~\\ref{sec:regex_baselines}).\nThe 6.22pp gap between regex and SFT concentrates on boundary samples where exceptions are raised but caught by \\texttt{try/except}---SFT correctly classifies 6/8, confirming that the model learns to distinguish caught from uncaught exceptions rather than merely detecting exception presence.\n\nTraining dynamics further illustrate the complexity beneath surface-level metrics: on DeepSeek, two seeds converge to nearly identical final training losses (0.122 vs.\\ 0.123) yet differ by 8.24pp in accuracy, demonstrating that token-level loss can mask fundamental differences in sample-level classification ability (Appendix~\\ref{sec:training_dynamics}).\nThe \\texttt{exception\\_only} 0.50pp cross-model gap---unaffected by truncation since inputs average ${\\sim}$200 tokens---provides a clean measure of model capability differences, suggesting a design principle: trace representations should match the model capability floor, not the ceiling (Appendix~\\ref{sec:robustness_analysis}).\nAdditional analysis of irreducible errors is in Appendix~\\ref{sec:irreducible}.\n",

The session summary indicates I'm waiting for Director's next instruction. The paper is in a stable state. Let me check if there are any new messages or instructions I need to act on. The user message says "Continue from where you left off" - but looking at the context, I was waiting for external inputs (Round 4 review, ae_only data, I9 fig1 fix).

Let me check the current state of things - read the latest files and see if there's anything new to act on.

    "content": "- update-config: Use this skill to configure the Claude Code harness via settings.json. Automated behaviors (\"from now on when X\", \"each time X\", \"whenever X\", \"before/after X\") require hooks configured in settings.json - the harness executes these, not Claude, so memory/preferences cannot fulfill them. Also use for: permissions (\"allow X\", \"add permission\", \"move permission to\"), env vars (\"set X=Y\"), hook troubleshooting, or any changes to settings.json/settings.local.json files. Examples: \"allow npm commands\", \"add bq permission to global settings\", \"move permission to user settings\", \"set DEBUG=true\", \"when claude stops show X\". For simple settings like theme/model, suggest the /config command.\n- keybindings-help: Use when the user wants to customize keyboard shortcuts, rebind keys, add chord bindings, or modify ~/.claude/keybindings.json. Examples: \"rebind ctrl+s\", \"add a chord shortcut\", \"change the submit key\", \"customize keybindings\".\n- simplify: Review changed code for reuse, quality, and efficiency, then fix any issues found.\n- fewer-permission-prompts: Scan your transcripts for common read-only Bash and MCP tool calls, then add a prioritized allowlist to project .claude/settings.json to reduce permission prompts.\n- loop: Run a prompt or slash command on a recurring interval (e.g. /loop 5m /foo). Omit the interval to let the model self-pace. - When the user wants to set up a recurring task, poll for status, or run something repeatedly on an interval (e.g. \"check the deploy every 5 minutes\", \"keep running /babysit-prs\"). Do NOT invoke for one-off tasks.\n- schedule: Create, update, list, or run scheduled remote agents (routines) that execute on a cron schedule. - When the user wants to schedule a recurring remote agent, set up automated tasks, create a cron job for Claude Code, or manage their scheduled agents/routines. Also use when the user wants a one-time scheduled run (\"run this once at 3pm\", \"remind me to check X tomorrow\").\n- claude-api: Build, debug, and optimize Claude API / Anthropic SDK apps. Apps built with this skill should include prompt caching. Also handles migrating existing Claude API code between Claude model versions (4.5 → 4.6, 4.6 → 4.7, retired-model replacements).\nTRIGGER when: code imports `anthropic`/`@anthropic-ai/sdk`; user asks for the Claude API, Anthropic SDK, or Managed Agents; user adds/modifies/tunes a Claude feature (caching, thinking, compaction, tool use, batch, files, citations, memory) or model (Opus/Sonnet/Haiku) in a file; questions about prompt caching / cache hit rate in an Anthropic SDK project.\nSKIP: file imports `openai`/other-provider SDK, filename like `*-openai.py`/`*-generic.py`, provider-neutral code, general programming/ML.\n- init: Initialize a new CLAUDE.md file with codebase documentation\n- review: Review a pull request\n- security-review: Complete a security review of the pending changes on the current branch",

[Director 指令] [Patch] 三组新数据需要整合进论文初稿：

1. **Regex baseline** (Table 新增行或独立 Table): regex_baseline_results.json 在 artifacts/_project/data/。核心数字：best regex 93.61% vs SFT exception_only 99.83%，McNemar p=0.041。证明 SFT 的必要性。加入 Experiments 对应小节。

2. **DebugBench 跨任务泛化** (新 Table 或 §4 新小节): debugbench_results.json 在 artifacts/_project/data/。exception_only 100% (426/426)，VOTA 99.77%，no_trace 96.71%。这是 Claim 1 的跨任务验证，加强 generalizability。

3. **Trace length ablation** (新 Figure + 对应文字): fig_trace_ablation.pdf 在服务器 /root/trace-verdict-study/artifacts/fig_trace_ablation.pdf，统计检验数据在 trace_ablation_bootstrap.json。非单调模式 (1024tok 显著比 512tok 差, p=0.002)，所有 full_trace 变体 vs exception_only 差距 18-23pp (p<0.001)。支撑 Claim 2。

**注意**：ae_only 3-seed 数据还在跑，完成后会再发一次 patch 补 seed robustness 数据。这次先整合以上三组。引用这次不用验证。

<details><summary>Logged reasoning block</summary>

```text
The Director wants me to integrate three new datasets into the paper. Let me first check the current state of the paper files to understand what's already there, since the summary mentions some of these may have already been integrated in the previous session.

From the summary:
- Regex baseline: already present in Table 2 row (line 75) + §4.2 text (lines 90-91) in experiments.tex
- DebugBench: §4.6 compressed to 3 lines + Appendix ref in experiments.tex
- Trace length ablation: §4.4 compressed to 3 lines + Appendix ref in experiments.tex


Now I'm checking the current experiments.tex and appendix.tex files to see what's actually there and verify the state of these sections.

1	\section{Experiments}
2	
3	We evaluate our trace preprocessing pipeline across two research questions:
4	(1)~Do Tier~1 exception signals generalize across models of different capability?
5	(2)~What is the relative contribution of each trace component to verdict prediction accuracy?
6	All experiments use our trace--verdict dataset (\S\ref{sec:dataset}) with $N{=}1{,}190$ test samples; accuracy is reported with Wilson 95\% confidence intervals unless stated otherwise.
7	Pairwise comparisons use paired bootstrap resampling ($B{=}10{,}000$, seed=42); all cross-condition differences reported below are significant at $p{<}0.0001$ unless noted otherwise.
8	
9	\subsection{Cross-Model Comparison}
10	\label{sec:cross_model}
11	
12	To test whether exception-based trace compression transfers across model families, we compare Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct and DeepSeek-Coder-6.7B-Instruct under four input conditions: \texttt{exception\_only} (Tier~1 exception events), VOTA (exception + assertion-point + loop compression), \texttt{full\_trace} (complete execution trace), and \texttt{no\_trace} (source code only).
13	
14	\begin{table}[t]
15	\centering
16	\small
17	\begin{tabular}{lccc}
18	\toprule
19	\textbf{Condition} & \textbf{Qwen-2.5-7B} & \textbf{DeepSeek-6.7B} & \textbf{Gap} \\
20	\midrule
21	exception\_only & \textbf{99.83}\% & 99.33\%$^\dag$ & 0.50pp \\
22	VOTA & 99.41\% & 84.45\% & 14.96pp \\
23	VOTA\_no\_ae & 99.41\%$^\S$ & --- & --- \\
24	full\_trace & 81.76\% & 79.16\% & 2.60pp \\
25	no\_trace & 75.13\% & 73.36\% & 1.77pp \\
26	\midrule
27	Majority baseline & 71.51\% & 71.51\% & --- \\
28	\bottomrule
29	\end{tabular}
30	\caption{Cross-model accuracy ($N{=}1{,}190$). Qwen CIs: exception\_only [99.58, 100.00], VOTA [98.82, 99.83], full\_trace [79.70, 83.90], no\_trace [72.77, 77.48]; DeepSeek CIs: full\_trace [76.80, 81.30], VOTA [82.60, 86.40], no\_trace [70.80, 75.70]. $^\dag$DeepSeek \texttt{exception\_only} 3-seed results: 99.33\% (seeds 42, 456; CI [98.82, 99.75]) and 91.09\% (seed 123; CI [89.40, 92.60]); seed 123 is a LoRA initialization outlier (fail recall = 70.5\% vs.\ 100\%). $^\S$VOTA\_no\_ae evaluated on Qwen only; CI [98.90, 99.80].}
31	\label{tab:cross_model}
32	\end{table}
33	
34	Table~\ref{tab:cross_model} reveals a striking asymmetry.
35	Under \texttt{exception\_only}, Qwen achieves 99.83\% $\pm$ 0.00 across three seeds, while DeepSeek shows a bimodal pattern: seeds 42 and 456 both achieve 99.33\% (gap = 0.50pp), while seed 123 yields 91.09\% (gap = 8.74pp), attributable to suboptimal LoRA initialization (fail recall = 70.5\% vs.\ 100\% for other seeds).
36	Even the outlier seed outperforms VOTA (84.45\%) by 6.64pp, confirming exception events as the most effective component across models (Figure~\ref{fig:cross_model_gap}).
37	Under VOTA, the gap widens to 14.96pp: DeepSeek drops to 84.45\% while Qwen remains at 99.41\%.
38	Post-hoc tokenizer analysis reveals a confound: measured on the training set using each model's tokenizer, the DeepSeek tokenizer averages 2{,}626 tokens per VOTA sample versus 1{,}929 for Qwen, causing 91.7\% of DeepSeek VOTA training samples to exceed the 2{,}048-token context window.
39	The VOTA training framework preserves the verdict label but truncates the trace content (input), so the model trains with incomplete diagnostic information for the vast majority of the dataset.
40	The 14.96pp gap thus reflects both model capability differences and training-time trace truncation; the two factors cannot be disentangled in the current design.
41	However, a post-hoc group analysis provides directional evidence: partitioning DeepSeek VOTA test samples by whether their training-set counterparts exceeded the context window, intact samples ($N{=}99$) achieve 100\% accuracy while truncated samples ($N{=}1{,}091$) achieve 83.04\% (95\% CI [80.75\%, 85.24\%]; Fisher exact $p{<}0.001$), with all 185 errors concentrated in the fail class of the truncated group (fail recall $=$ 31.23\%).
42	In contrast, the \texttt{exception\_only} condition is unaffected by truncation because exception-based inputs are short enough to fit within the context window for both tokenizers, making its cross-model comparison clean.
43	Per-class analysis (Appendix~\ref{sec:per_class}) reveals the mechanism: DeepSeek VOTA achieves 100\% fail precision but only 45.43\% fail recall, systematically defaulting to \texttt{pass}---in contrast to Qwen VOTA, which achieves 100\% fail recall.
44	
45	The \texttt{no\_trace} baseline confirms that source code alone provides limited signal (75.13\% for Qwen, 73.36\% for DeepSeek), only marginally above majority-class guessing (71.51\%).
46	
47	Seed robustness diverges sharply across models.
48	Qwen \texttt{exception\_only} produces identical accuracy of 99.83\% across all three seeds ($\sigma{=}0$, $n{=}3$, exactly two errors each).
49	DeepSeek shows a bimodal pattern ($n{=}3$): seeds 42 and 456 both achieve 99.33\% (8 errors each, fail recall = 100\%), while seed 123 yields 91.09\% (fail recall = 70.5\%), consistent with LoRA initialization sensitivity on the smaller model.
50	Because the \texttt{exception\_only} test set contains 48.99\% duplicate inputs (607 unique out of 1,190; \S\ref{sec:dataset}), the reported CIs assume $n{=}1{,}190$ independent trials.
51	Under deduplication ($n{=}607$), Qwen's two errors yield 99.67\% accuracy (Wilson CI [98.81, 99.91]), confirming that the result is robust to the effective sample size.
52	
53	\begin{figure}[t]
54	\centering
55	\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{fig3_cross_model_gap}
56	\caption{Cross-model accuracy gap (Qwen $-$ DeepSeek) across trace conditions. Exception-based signals transfer across models (0.50pp gap), while VOTA diverges (14.96pp gap, confounded by tokenizer-driven trace truncation; \S\ref{sec:cross_model}).}
57	\label{fig:cross_model_gap}
58	\end{figure}
59	
60	\subsection{Component Ablation}
61	\label{sec:ablation}
62	
63	We decompose the VOTA pipeline into individual components on Qwen-2.5-7B (seed=42).
64	Table~\ref{tab:ablation} arranges conditions into a two-tier hierarchy: Tier~1 signals (\texttt{ae\_only}, \texttt{exception\_only}) that individually achieve ${\geq}$99.8\% accuracy, and Tier~2 signals (\texttt{loop\_only}) that provide moderate improvement over the no-trace baseline.

87	\label{tab:ablation}
88	\end{table}
89	
90	Two findings stand out.
91	First, the Tier~1 signals are individually sufficient: \texttt{ae\_only} (99.92\%) and \texttt{exception\_only} (99.83\%) are not distinguishable ($p{=}0.80$, paired bootstrap, $B{=}10{,}000$), and both exceed VOTA (99.41\%, $p{=}0.01$ for \texttt{exception\_only} vs.\ VOTA, paired bootstrap).
92	This implies that combining signals in VOTA introduces minor noise rather than complementary information.
93	Second, removing assertion points from VOTA has no effect (VOTA\_no\_ae = VOTA = 99.41\%), confirming that within the VOTA mixture, exception events dominate the prediction signal.
94	
95	Tier~2 signal \texttt{loop\_only} (85.63\%) improves over \texttt{no\_trace} (75.13\%) by 10.50pp ($p{<}0.0001$, bootstrap 95\% CI $[{+}8.24, {+}12.86]$), showing that loop compression captures some execution semantics, but far less than exception events.
96	
97	To contextualize against non-learning baselines, the strongest regex---pattern-matching on exception type names---achieves 93.61\% (Table~\ref{tab:ablation}), 6.22pp below SFT \texttt{exception\_only} (McNemar $p{<}0.001$).
98	The gap concentrates on 8 boundary samples where exceptions are raised but caught by \texttt{try/except}: SFT correctly classifies 6/8, while regex misclassifies all 8, demonstrating that the model distinguishes caught from uncaught exceptions (Appendix~\ref{sec:regex_baselines}).
99	
100	\subsection{Information Density Decomposition}
101	\label{sec:density}
102	
103	The gap between \texttt{full\_trace} (81.76\%) and VOTA (99.41\%) is 17.65pp.
104	We decompose this gap into two mechanisms by introducing an intermediate condition, \texttt{full\_trace\_label\_only}, which retains the complete trace as input but computes loss only on the verdict token, masking all trace tokens during training.
105	
106	\begin{table}[t]
107	\centering
108	\small
109	\begin{tabular}{lccc}
110	\toprule
111	\textbf{Condition} & \textbf{Acc (\%)} & \textbf{$\Delta$ vs.\ full\_trace} & \textbf{Gap explained} \\
112	\midrule
113	full\_trace & 81.76 & --- & --- \\
114	label\_only & 86.22 & +4.46pp & 26\% \\
115	VOTA & 99.41 & +17.65pp & 100\% \\
116	\bottomrule
117	\end{tabular}
118	\caption{Information density decomposition. The full\_trace$\to$VOTA gap decomposes into gradient dilution (26\%, addressed by masking trace tokens from the loss) and information overload (74\%, addressed by removing irrelevant trace lines via VOTA compression).}
119	\label{tab:density}
120	\end{table}
121	
122	As shown in Table~\ref{tab:density}, the decomposition attributes 26\% of the gap (+4.46pp, $p{<}0.0001$, bootstrap 95\% CI $[{+}2.35, {+}6.55]$) to \emph{gradient dilution}---the training signal is diluted across trace tokens that do not contribute to verdict prediction---and 74\% (+13.19pp) to \emph{information overload}---the model must process trace lines irrelevant to the fault at inference time.
123	This two-factor decomposition is consistent across models: the VOTA cross-model gap (14.96pp, Table~\ref{tab:cross_model}) is confounded by training-time trace truncation on DeepSeek (\S\ref{sec:cross_model}), which amplifies information overload by removing diagnostic trace content from the majority of training samples.
124	
125	\subsection{Trace Length Ablation}
126	\label{sec:trace_length}
127	
128	To test whether the \texttt{full\_trace} performance gap is driven by input truncation, we vary the maximum trace token budget (256, 512, 1024, no limit) on Qwen-2.5-7B (seed=42).
129	All four conditions fall within a 5pp range (77.2\%--81.8\%) with broadly overlapping CIs and a non-monotonic trend (Appendix~\ref{sec:trace_length_full}), confirming that trace content quality---not quantity---is the bottleneck.
130	Even with unlimited tokens, the model cannot extract the diagnostic signal that VOTA's targeted compression provides, reinforcing the information density interpretation (\S\ref{sec:density}).
131	
132	\subsection{Calibration Analysis}
133	\label{sec:calibration}
134	
135	Calibration quality mirrors the tier hierarchy (Appendix~\ref{sec:calibration_full}): \texttt{exception\_only} achieves ECE = 0.0027 and Brier = 0.0013, versus \texttt{no\_trace} ECE = 0.171 and Brier = 0.197---a 63$\times$ ECE gap.
136	VOTA (ECE = 0.0054) is well-calibrated but slightly worse than either Tier~1 component alone, reinforcing the dilution pattern.
137	
138	\subsection{Cross-Dataset Generalization}
139	\label{sec:debugbench}
140	
141	To test generalization beyond LLM-generated solutions, we evaluate on DebugBench \citep{tian2024debugbench}---426 Python samples with synthetically injected bugs (Appendix~\ref{sec:debugbench_full}).
142	The component ranking is preserved: \texttt{exception\_only} achieves 100\% accuracy, VOTA 99.77\%, and \texttt{no\_trace} 96.71\%.
143	The narrow margins reflect a ceiling effect from structurally distinctive mutations; the 24.70pp trace lift on the main dataset remains the primary evidence for trace signal value.

103	\label{sec:vota_examples}
104	
105	We provide two representative VOTA trace examples illustrating the fail and pass cases.
106	In the fail case, the exception event provides an unambiguous fault signal.
107	In the pass case, the absence of an exception event combined with a matching assertion point confirms correct execution.
108	
109	\paragraph{Fail example.}
110	A \texttt{ZeroDivisionError} triggers an \texttt{[ERROR]} event, providing a direct fault signal that is sufficient for the model to predict \texttt{fail}.
111	
112	\begin{small}
113	\begin{verbatim}
114	## Function
115	def divide(a, b):
116	    return a / b
117	
118	## Test Input
119	divide(1, 0)
120	
121	## Expected Output
122	inf

124	## VOTA Trace
125	[ERROR] ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
126	
127	## Verdict
128	fail
129	\end{verbatim}
130	\end{small}
131	
132	\paragraph{Pass example.}
133	No exception is raised, and the assertion point confirms that the actual output matches the expected value.
134	
135	\begin{small}
136	\begin{verbatim}
137	## Function
138	def add(a, b):
139	    return a + b
140	
141	## Test Input
142	add(2, 3)
143	
144	## Expected Output
145	5
146	
147	## VOTA Trace
148	[LOOP] No loops detected.
149	[ASSERT] actual=5, expected=5
150	
151	## Verdict
152	pass
153	\end{verbatim}
154	\end{small}
155	
156	These examples illustrate the core asymmetry exploited by the \texttt{exception\_only} condition: fail cases produce an explicit \texttt{[ERROR]} event, while pass cases are characterized by its absence.
157	This binary signal---presence vs.\ absence of an exception---is sufficient for near-perfect verdict prediction.

211	\section{Irreducible Sample Analysis}
212	\label{sec:irreducible}
213	
214	The \texttt{exception\_only} condition with Qwen-2.5-Coder-7B misclassifies exactly 2 out of 1,190 test samples across all three seeds (42, 123, 456), with 100\% overlap across seeds.
215	Both samples (IDs 901 and 905) share the following characteristics:
216	
217	\begin{itemize}
218	\item \textbf{Function:} \texttt{check\_dict\_case} (HumanEval/95)---a function that checks whether all dictionary keys are uniformly upper-case or lower-case strings.
219	\item \textbf{Ground-truth label:} \texttt{pass}.
220	\item \textbf{Predicted label:} \texttt{fail} (false negative).
221	\item \textbf{Cross-seed consistency:} Both samples are misclassified identically by all three seeds, indicating a systematic rather than stochastic error.
222	\end{itemize}
223	
224	Manual inspection reveals the root cause: \texttt{check\_dict\_case} uses \texttt{all()} over a generator expression, and Python's \texttt{all()} short-circuits on the first \texttt{True} value, raising \texttt{GeneratorExit} to terminate the generator.
225	Because \texttt{GeneratorExit} is a \texttt{BaseException} subclass, the tracer records it as seven \texttt{[ERROR] GeneratorExit} lines---even though the function executes correctly and the test passes.
226	The model observes these spurious error markers and reasonably but incorrectly predicts \texttt{fail}.
227	This is not a model failure but a representation ceiling: the \texttt{exception\_only} format cannot distinguish genuine exceptions from benign \texttt{BaseException} subclasses triggered by Python's iterator protocol.
228	
229	These 2 irreducible errors establish a practical accuracy ceiling of $1 - 2/1190 = 99.83\%$ for the \texttt{exception\_only} condition on this dataset, suggesting that further improvements would require either supplementary trace signals or modifications to the input representation.

Accuracy remains in a narrow band regardless of trace length, confirming that trace content quality---not quantity---is the bottleneck.}
258	\label{fig:trace_length}
259	\end{figure}
260	
261	As shown in Table~\ref{tab:trace_length} and Figure~\ref{fig:trace_length}, all four trace length conditions fall within a 5pp range (77.2\%--81.8\%) with broadly overlapping confidence intervals.
262	The trend is non-monotonic (1024 tokens yields the lowest accuracy at 77.23\%), and no condition approaches the VOTA (99.41\%) or \texttt{exception\_only} (99.83\%) baselines.
263	This suggests that input truncation alone does not explain the full-trace performance gap: even with unlimited trace tokens, the model cannot extract the diagnostic signal that VOTA's targeted compression provides.
264	The result reinforces the information density interpretation (\S\ref{sec:density}): the gap between full traces and VOTA is driven by the \emph{content} of the trace (irrelevant lines diluting the diagnostic signal), not its \emph{length}.
265	In contrast, VOTA's compressed representation concentrates the diagnostic signal into fewer tokens, making it sensitive to truncation when those tokens are removed (\S\ref{sec:cross_model}).

291	Table~\ref{tab:calibration} shows that calibration quality mirrors the Tier~1/2 hierarchy.
292	Tier~1 conditions (\texttt{ae\_only}: ECE=0.0004; \texttt{exception\_only}: ECE=0.0027) produce near-perfectly calibrated predictions, while \texttt{full\_trace} (ECE=0.096) and \texttt{no\_trace} (ECE=0.171) exhibit substantial miscalibration.
293	VOTA (ECE=0.0054) is well-calibrated but slightly worse than either Tier~1 component alone, reinforcing the pattern that combining trace signals dilutes rather than improves the prediction signal.
294	
295	The Brier scores tell a consistent story: \texttt{ae\_only} (0.0008) and \texttt{exception\_only} (0.0013) achieve near-zero scores, while \texttt{no\_trace} (0.197) indicates substantial miscalibration.

306	\label{sec:debugbench_full}
307	
308	To test whether exception-based verdict prediction generalizes beyond LLM-generated solutions, we evaluate on DebugBench \citep{tian2024debugbench}---a dataset of human-written programs with synthetically injected bugs (single-point mutations such as operator replacement, variable misuse, and missing statements).
309	After filtering for executable Python samples with valid traces, we retain 426 samples with a near-balanced class distribution (majority baseline: 51.4\%).

326	\label{tab:debugbench}
327	\end{table}
328	
329	Table~\ref{tab:debugbench} shows that the component ranking from the main experiments is preserved: \texttt{exception\_only} (100.00\%) $\geq$ VOTA (99.77\%) $>$ \texttt{no\_trace} (96.71\%).
330	The \texttt{exception\_only} condition achieves perfect accuracy, confirming that the exception-based representation generalizes to a different fault distribution without degradation.
331	
332	The absolute margins are much narrower than on the main dataset: the \texttt{no\_trace} baseline already achieves 96.71\%---compared to 75.13\% on HumanEval+MBPP---leaving only 3.29pp of headroom for trace-based improvement.
333	This ceiling effect reflects a fundamental difference in fault characteristics: DebugBench bugs are synthetically injected single-point mutations, which produce code that is structurally dissimilar from the original correct solution; a model can often identify the fault from source code alone.
334	In contrast, the HumanEval+MBPP solutions are LLM-generated, producing natural errors (logic mistakes, edge-case failures) where the faulty and correct solutions may be structurally similar, making code-only verdict prediction substantially harder.
335	
336	These results support exception-based verdict prediction as a generalizable approach---the method does not degrade on an out-of-distribution dataset, and the exception dominance ranking (exception\_only $\geq$ VOTA $>$ no\_trace) is consistent across both datasets---but the narrow DebugBench margins are insufficient to independently validate trace importance.
337	The 24.70pp trace lift on the main dataset (no\_trace 75.13\% $\to$ exception\_only 99.83\%) remains the primary evidence for the value of exception-based trace signals.
338	
339	%% ============================================================
340	\section{Cross-Model Robustness Analysis}
341	\label{sec:robustness_analysis}
342	
343	The cross-model gap pattern (Table~\ref{tab:cross_model}) suggests a design principle: \emph{trace representations should match the model capability floor, not the ceiling.}
344	Exception events are consistently the most effective component on both models, and their structural simplicity---a fixed-format error message---ensures that the relative advantage over richer representations holds across all seeds.
345	Two of three DeepSeek seeds match Qwen-level accuracy (99.33\%); the outlier (seed 123, 91.09\%) is attributable to LoRA initialization landing in a suboptimal basin (fail recall = 70.5\%), not to a failure of the exception signal itself---even this outlier outperforms VOTA (84.45\%) by 6.64pp.
346	The VOTA cross-model gap is confounded by two factors: (1)~tokenizer efficiency---the DeepSeek tokenizer averages 2{,}626 tokens per VOTA sample versus Qwen's 1{,}929, causing 91.7\% of training samples to exceed the 2{,}048-token context window; content-aware truncation preferentially removes the terminal structured prompt, preserving the verdict label but truncating trace content---and (2)~base model capability differences, consistent with findings that SFT generalization depends on pretrain quality \citep{yang2024generalization}.
347	The two factors cannot be disentangled in the current experimental design.
348	Our \texttt{exception\_only} design sidesteps the truncation confound entirely: inputs average ${\sim}$200 tokens, well below the 2{,}048-token limit, so no training samples are truncated on either model.
349	The resulting 0.50pp cross-model gap (Table~\ref{tab:cross_model}) is therefore a clean measure of model capability differences, making the ``capability floor'' principle directly testable.
350	The practical implication is that trace-based systems should default to the simplest sufficient signal; for smaller models, training stability (multi-seed selection, warmup schedules) is a secondary but addressable concern.

353	\section{Training Dynamics and Loss Decoupling}
354	\label{sec:training_dynamics}
355	
356	The DeepSeek \texttt{exception\_only} results reveal two instructive training dynamics.
357	First, epoch-level analysis shows mild degradation in 2/3 seeds: seed 42 peaks at 99.83\% after epoch~1 but settles at 99.33\% by epoch~3 ($-$0.50pp), seed 123 degrades from 91.43\% to 91.09\% ($-$0.34pp), while seed 456 shows no epoch degradation (99.33\% at both epoch~1 and epoch~3).
358	Early stopping may yield marginal gains for some seeds, but the epoch effect is small (${\leq}$0.5pp) compared to the seed effect (8.24pp between seeds 42 and 123).
359	
360	Second, seeds 123 and 456 converge to nearly identical final training losses (0.122 and 0.123 respectively), yet their accuracies differ by 8.24pp (91.09\% vs.\ 99.33\%).
361	The critical difference lies in fail recall: seeds 42 and 456 achieve 100\%, while seed 123 achieves only 70.5\%---the LoRA initialization in seed 123 fails to learn the exception$\to$fail mapping for a substantial fraction of failing samples, even though the per-token loss appears converged.
362	This demonstrates that token-level training loss can mask fundamental differences in sample-level classification ability, suggesting a parallel to the eval-loss/accuracy decoupling observed in DeepSeek VOTA (where eval loss rose 65\% from epoch 1 to 3 while accuracy improved by 6.3pp) at the training phase.
363	The practical recommendation is twofold: (1)~use task-specific metrics (accuracy, fail recall) for checkpoint and seed selection rather than training or evaluation loss, and (2)~for deployment on smaller models, train multiple seeds and select the best, as a single run may not reliably converge to the correct classification boundary.
364	
365	The contrast with VOTA is instructive: DeepSeek VOTA accuracy monotonically increases from 78.15\% to 84.45\% across epochs, but is consistent with a performance limit associated with the high trace truncation rate (\S\ref{sec:cross_model})---the model progressively extracts signal from samples with intact trace content but cannot fully compensate for the information loss in the truncated majority.
366	The 84.45\% accuracy reflects a combination of trace information loss and model capability constraints.
367	
368	%% ============================================================
369	\section{Deduplication Statistics}
370	\label{sec:dedup_stats}
371	
372	Table~\ref{tab:dedup} reports the duplication rates across trace formats.
373	Because multiple passing solutions to the same problem produce identical (input, output) pairs in the \texttt{exception\_only} format---correct executions raise no exceptions, so the trace content is the same regardless of the solution's internal logic---the dataset contains duplicate rows.
374	Train--test input overlap is zero (split by problem ID), so no information leakage occurs.
375	The high duplication in \texttt{exception\_only} does not affect our experimental conclusions: after deduplication the training set still contains 2,858 unique samples and the test set 607, providing sufficient coverage for the 591-problem benchmark.
376	The \texttt{exception\_only} test set contains 48.99\% duplicate inputs due to representation compactness; all confidence intervals treat samples as independent Bernoulli trials.

395	\section{Regex Baseline Analysis}
396	\label{sec:regex_baselines}
397	
398	To establish a non-learning upper bound, we evaluate five regex-based baselines on the \texttt{exception\_only} test set ($N{=}1{,}190$) and two format-specific baselines on VOTA and \texttt{full\_trace} inputs.
399	
400	\begin{table}[t]

402	\small
403	\begin{tabular}{llc}
404	\toprule
405	\textbf{Baseline} & \textbf{Method} & \textbf{Acc (\%)} \\
406	\midrule
407	B1: \texttt{[ERROR]} presence & string match & 93.45 \\
408	B2: Traceback presence & string match & 71.51 \\
409	B3: Any keyword & union of B1+B2+Exception & 93.45 \\
410	B4: Exception type regex & regex on exception class names & \textbf{93.61} \\
411	B5: Format marker & \texttt{[No exception data]} $\to$ pass & 99.33$^\ddag$ \\
412	\midrule
413	VOTA format regex & best regex on VOTA traces & 75.55 \\
414	full\_trace format regex & best regex on full traces & 77.39 \\
415	\bottomrule
416	\end{tabular}
417	\caption{Regex baseline accuracy ($N{=}1{,}190$). B4 is the strongest legitimate baseline (6.22pp below SFT \texttt{exception\_only}, McNemar $p{<}0.001$). $^\ddag$B5 exploits a data formatting artifact: the \texttt{[No exception data in trace]} marker is deterministically present in all pass samples, making this a format-level shortcut rather than a genuine exception-based heuristic.}
418	\label{tab:regex}
419	\end{table}
420	
421	The strongest legitimate baseline (B4, 93.61\%) applies regex pattern-matching on Python exception class names (e.g., \texttt{ValueError}, \texttt{TypeError}).
422	Its errors concentrate on 8 boundary samples where a \texttt{ValueError} is raised inside a \texttt{try/except} block and caught---the program passes despite an exception occurring in the trace.
423	SFT \texttt{exception\_only} correctly classifies 6 of these 8 samples, indicating that the model learns the semantic distinction between caught (benign) and uncaught (fault-indicating) exceptions.
424	B5 (99.33\%) achieves near-SFT accuracy but relies on the deterministic presence of a format marker in pass-class traces, which is an artifact of the trace preprocessing pipeline rather than a generalizable signal; McNemar test vs.\ SFT yields $p{=}0.041$, confirming a statistically significant difference.

The component ranking (exception\\_only $\\geq$ VOTA $>$ no\\_trace) is preserved, and exception\\_only achieves perfect accuracy.}\n\\label{tab:debugbench}\n\\end{table}\n\nTable~\\ref{tab:debugbench} shows that the component ranking from the main experiments is preserved: \\texttt{exception\\_only} (100.00\\%) $\\geq$ VOTA (99.77\\%) $>$ \\texttt{no\\_trace} (96.71\\%).\nThe \\texttt{exception\\_only} condition achieves perfect accuracy, confirming that the exception-based representation generalizes to a different fault distribution without degradation.\n\nThe absolute margins are much narrower than on the main dataset: the \\texttt{no\\_trace} baseline already achieves 96.71\\%---compared to 75.13\\% on HumanEval+MBPP---leaving only 3.29pp of headroom for trace-based improvement.\nThis ceiling effect reflects a fundamental difference in fault characteristics: DebugBench bugs are synthetically injected single-point mutations, which produce code that is structurally dissimilar from the original correct solution; a model can often identify the fault from source code alone.\nIn contrast, the HumanEval+MBPP solutions are LLM-generated, producing natural errors (logic mistakes, edge-case failures) where the faulty and correct solutions may be structurally similar, making code-only verdict prediction substantially harder.\n\nThese results support exception-based verdict prediction as a generalizable approach---the method does not degrade on an out-of-distribution dataset, and the exception dominance ranking (exception\\_only $\\geq$ VOTA $>$ no\\_trace) is consistent across both datasets---but the narrow DebugBench margins are insufficient to independently validate trace importance.\nThe 24.70pp trace lift on the main dataset (no\\_trace 75.13\\% $\\to$ exception\\_only 99.83\\%) remains the primary evidence for the value of exception-based trace signals.\n\n%% ============================================================\n\\section{Cross-Model Robustness Analysis}\n\\label{sec:robustness_analysis}\n\nThe cross-model gap pattern (Table~\\ref{tab:cross_model}) suggests a design principle: \\emph{trace representations should match the model capability floor, not the ceiling.}\nException events are consistently the most effective component on both models, and their structural simplicity---a fixed-format error message---ensures that the relative advantage over richer representations holds across all seeds.\nTwo of three DeepSeek seeds match Qwen-level accuracy (99.33\\%); the outlier (seed 123, 91.09\\%) is attributable to LoRA initialization landing in a suboptimal basin (fail recall = 70.5\\%), not to a failure of the exception signal itself---even this outlier outperforms VOTA (84.45\\%) by 6.64pp.\nThe VOTA cross-model gap is confounded by two factors: (1)~tokenizer efficiency---the DeepSeek tokenizer averages 2{,}626 tokens per VOTA sample versus Qwen's 1{,}929, causing 91.7\\% of training samples to exceed the 2{,}048-token context window; content-aware truncation preferentially removes the terminal structured prompt, preserving the verdict label but truncating trace content---and (2)~base model capability differences, consistent with findings that SFT generalization depends on pretrain quality \\citep{yang2024generalization}.\nThe two factors cannot be disentangled in the current experimental design.\nOur \\texttt{exception\\_only} design sidesteps the truncation confound entirely: inputs average ${\\sim}$200 tokens, well below the 2{,}048-token limit, so no training samples are truncated on either model.\nThe resulting 0.50pp cross-model gap (Table~\\ref{tab:cross_model}) is therefore a clean measure of model capability differences, making the ``capability floor'' principle directly testable.\nThe practical implication is that trace-based systems should default to the simplest sufficient signal; for smaller models, training stability (multi-seed selection, warmup schedules) is a secondary but addressable concern.\n\n%% ============================================================\n\\section{Training Dynamics and Loss Decoupling}\n\\label{sec:training_dynamics}\n\nThe DeepSeek \\texttt{exception\\_only} results reveal two instructive training dynamics.\nFirst, epoch-level analysis shows mild degradation in 2/3 seeds: seed 42 peaks at 99.83\\% after epoch~1 but settles at 99.33\\% by epoch~3 ($-$0.50pp), seed 123 degrades from 91.43\\% to 91.09\\% ($-$0.34pp), while seed 456 shows no epoch degradation (99.33\\% at both epoch~1 and epoch~3).\nEarly stopping may yield marginal gains for some seeds, but the epoch effect is small (${\\leq}$0.5pp) compared to the seed effect (8.24pp between seeds 42 and 123).\n\nSecond, seeds 123 and 456 converge to nearly identical final training losses (0.122 and 0.123 respectively), yet their accuracies differ by 8.24pp (91.09\\% vs.\\ 99.33\\%).\nThe critical difference lies in fail recall: seeds 42 and 456 achieve 100\\%, while seed 123 achieves only 70.5\\%---the LoRA initialization in seed 123 fails to learn the exception$\\to$fail mapping for a substantial fraction of failing samples, even though the per-token loss appears converged.\nThis demonstrates that token-level training loss can mask fundamental differences in sample-level classification ability, suggesting a parallel to the eval-loss/accuracy decoupling observed in DeepSeek VOTA (where eval loss rose 65\\% from epoch 1 to 3 while accuracy improved by 6.3pp) at the training phase.\nThe practical recommendation is twofold: (1)~use task-specific metrics (accuracy, fail recall) for checkpoint and seed selection rather than training or evaluation loss, and (2)~for deployment on smaller models, train multiple seeds and select the best, as a single run may not reliably converge to the correct classification boundary.\n\nThe contrast with VOTA is instructive: DeepSeek VOTA accuracy monotonically increases from 78.15\\% to 84.45\\% across epochs, but is consistent with a performance limit associated with the high trace truncation rate (\\S\\ref{sec:cross_model})---the model progressively extracts signal from samples with intact trace content but cannot fully compensate for the information loss in the truncated majority.\nThe 84.45\\% accuracy reflects a combination of trace information loss and model capability constraints.\n\n%% ============================================================\n\\section{Deduplication Statistics}\n\\label{sec:dedup_stats}\n\nTable~\\ref{tab:dedup} reports the duplication rates across trace formats.\nBecause multiple passing solutions to the same problem produce identical (input, output) pairs in the \\texttt{exception\\_only} format---correct executions raise no exceptions, so the trace content is the same regardless of the solution's internal logic---the dataset contains duplicate rows.\nTrain--test input overlap is zero (split by problem ID), so no information leakage occurs.\nThe high duplication in \\texttt{exception\\_only} does not affect our experimental conclusions: after deduplication the training set still contains 2,858 unique samples and the test set 607, providing sufficient coverage for the 591-problem benchmark.\nThe \\texttt{exception\\_only} test set contains 48.99\\% duplicate inputs due to representation compactness; all confidence intervals treat samples as independent Bernoulli trials.\n\n\\begin{table}[t]\n\\centering\n\\small\n\\begin{tabular}{lccc}\n\\toprule\n\\textbf{Split} & \\textbf{Total} & \\textbf{Unique} & \\textbf{Dup.\\ rate} \\\\\n\\midrule\nexception\\_only train & 4{,}720 & 2{,}858 & 39.45\\% \\\\\nexception\\_only test  & 1{,}190 &   607 & 48.99\\% \\\\\nraw\\_traces (full)    & 5{,}910 & 5{,}803 &  1.81\\% \\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}\n\\caption{Deduplication statistics.

After reading both files, I can confirm that all three data groups are already integrated:

1. **Regex baseline**: 
   - In experiments.tex: Table 2 (tab:ablation) has a "Regex (best)" row at line 82, and §4.2 text discusses it at lines 97-98
   - In appendix.tex: Full regex analysis in §sec:regex_baselines with Table tab:regex (lines 395-424)

2. **DebugBench**:
   - In experiments.tex: §4.6 (lines 139-143) with summary numbers (exception_only 100%, VOTA 99.77%, no_trace 96.71%)
   - In appendix.tex: Full DebugBench analysis in §sec:debugbench_full (lines 305-337) with Table tab:debugbench

3. **Trace length ablation**:
   - In experiments.tex: §4.4 (lines 125-130) with summary (77.2%-81.8%, non-monotonic, appendix ref)
   - In appendix.tex: Full trace length ablation in §sec:trace_length_full (lines 232-265) with Table tab:trace_length and Figure fig:trace_length

Everything's already in place across both documents, so I can let the Director know we're good to go.

  "content": "[服务器重启后首条消息] 当前日期: 2026-05-16。服务器刚重启，项目状态可能已更新。不要依赖对话历史中的状态信息，以 registry 当前值为准。\n\n**用户消息：** [Director 指令] [Patch] 论文大规模更新——新增 Qwen-1.5B + CodeLlama-13B + nomarker ablation 数据，调整核心叙事。\n\n**目标会议**: EMNLP 2026 ARR May cycle（DDL 5/25，还剩 ~9 天）\n**论文真源路径**: 远程服务器 westd-11235 `/root/trace-verdict-study/docs/paper/`\n\n---\n\n## 需要更新的内容\n\n### 1. Table 1 扩展（最高优先级）\n原 Table 只有 Qwen-7B + DeepSeek-6.7B。现在需要加：\n- **Qwen-1.5B** 行：exception_only=99.83%, vota=99.58%, full_trace=77.06%, no_trace=67.31%\n- **CodeLlama-13B** 行：exception_only=99.89%±0.10 (3-seed), vota=98.57%, no_trace=76.50%\n- 所有多 seed 数据以 mean±std 报告\n\n### 2. Cross-Scale/Cross-Family Analysis（新增 section 或扩展 Results）\n核心发现：\n- exception_only 跨 4 模型、3 架构、1.5B-13B = 99.33-100%（scale-invariant）\n- no_trace 跨 scale: 67.3%(1.5B) < 75.1%(7B) < 76.5%(13B)（scale-sensitive）\n- 信号质量决定性能，不是模型容量（D053: \"demonstrate\" not \"suggest\"）\n\n建议 Figure：X轴=scale, 两条线——exception_only 平坦 ~99.8% vs no_trace 从 67%→77% 上升\n\n### 3. Nomarker Ablation（回应 R1-N1 \"format shortcut\" concern）\n- 7B 3-seed mean: 97.65% ± 0.96% (去掉 [No exception data in trace] 标记)\n- 1.5B: 97.82%\n- Marker 贡献: +2.18pp（仅占总 lift 的 ~9%）\n- 叙事: \"Exception events provide two signal layers: structural markers (~2pp, regex-learnable) + semantic content (~22pp, SFT-learnable). Both are independently scale-invariant.\"\n\n### 4. D057 Narrative 调整\n- OLD: \"irreducible ceiling at 99.83% from data artifacts\"\n- NEW: \"near-perfect floor of 99.83% across all models/seeds; CodeLlama-13B seed123 achieves 100%, confirming errors are high-probability convergence artifacts rather than hard data limitations\"\n- 注意：Qwen 全部 seed 稳定在 99.83%，CodeLlama 2/3 seeds 99.83% + 1 seed 100%\n\n### 5. Discussion 更新\n- Signal-limited claim 升级为正式 finding（限定 \"on this task\"）\n- 加 caught exception 分析（DeepSeek MBPP/113: 6 extra errors from caught ValueError）\n- Scale gradient 叙事：no_trace gap 单调递增（更大模型在低信号时更好），exception_only 完全消除 scale 差异\n\n### 6. Limitations 更新\n- 删除 \"only two models at ~7B\"（已过时）\n- 保留：单任务(verdict prediction)、单数据集(HumanEval+MBPP)、LoRA 训练特异性\n\n### 7. DeepSeek seed123 处理\n- 91.09% 是 LoRA 初始化 + 截断边界格式崩溃（非 signal insufficiency）\n- Table 中报告所有 seeds，正文注明 \"training instability, analysis in Appendix\"\n- Appendix 加简短诊断：同 loss 但输出格式崩溃\n\n---\n\n## 数据来源\n完整结果矩阵已在 `/root/trace-verdict-study/docs/paper/full_results_matrix.md`。\n分析 artifacts 在同目录下（cross_model_exception_only_overlap.md, table1_data.md 等）。\n\n## 引用需要验证\n这次需要验证——新增了 cross-architecture 相关工作引用。\n\n## 关键决策参考\n- D053: signal-limited \"suggest\"→\"demonstrate\"\n- D055: two-layer signal (markers + content)\n- D056: content signal scale-invariant\n- D057: ceiling 修正（99.83% floor, 100% achievable）"

[服务器重启后首条消息] 当前日期: 2026-05-16。服务器刚重启，项目状态可能已更新。不要依赖对话历史中的状态信息，以 registry 当前值为准。

**用户消息：** [Director 指令] [Patch] 论文大规模更新——新增 Qwen-1.5B + CodeLlama-13B + nomarker ablation 数据，调整核心叙事。

**目标会议**: EMNLP 2026 ARR May cycle（DDL 5/25，还剩 ~9 天）
**论文真源路径**: 远程服务器 westd-11235 `/root/trace-verdict-study/docs/paper/`

---

## 需要更新的内容

### 1. Table 1 扩展（最高优先级）
原 Table 只有 Qwen-7B + DeepSeek-6.7B。现在需要加：
- **Qwen-1.5B** 行：exception_only=99.83%, vota=99.58%, full_trace=77.06%, no_trace=67.31%
- **CodeLlama-13B** 行：exception_only=99.89%±0.10 (3-seed), vota=98.57%, no_trace=76.50%
- 所有多 seed 数据以 mean±std 报告

### 2. Cross-Scale/Cross-Family Analysis（新增 section 或扩展 Results）
核心发现：
- exception_only 跨 4 模型、3 架构、1.5B-13B = 99.33-100%（scale-invariant）
- no_trace 跨 scale: 67.3%(1.5B) < 75.1%(7B) < 76.5%(13B)（scale-sensitive）
- 信号质量决定性能，不是模型容量（D053: "demonstrate" not "suggest"）

建议 Figure：X轴=scale, 两条线——exception_only 平坦 ~99.8% vs no_trace 从 67%→77% 上升

### 3. Nomarker Ablation（回应 R1-N1 "format shortcut" concern）
- 7B 3-seed mean: 97.65% ± 0.96% (去掉 [No exception data in trace] 标记)
- 1.5B: 97.82%
- Marker 贡献: +2.18pp（仅占总 lift 的 ~9%）
- 叙事: "Exception events provide two signal layers: structural markers (~2pp, regex-learnable) + semantic content (~22pp, SFT-learnable). Both are independently scale-invariant."

### 4. D057 Narrative 调整
- OLD: "irreducible ceiling at 99.83% from data artifacts"
- NEW: "near-perfect floor of 99.83% across all models/seeds; CodeLlama-13B seed123 achieves 100%, confirming errors are high-probability convergence artifacts rather than hard data limitations"
- 注意：Qwen 全部 seed 稳定在 99.83%，CodeLlama 2/3 seeds 99.83% + 1 seed 100%

### 5. Discussion 更新
- Signal-limited claim 升级为正式 finding（限定 "on this task"）
- 加 caught exception 分析（DeepSeek MBPP/113: 6 extra errors from caught ValueError）
- Scale gradient 叙事：no_trace gap 单调递增（更大模型在低信号时更好），exception_only 完全消除 scale 差异

### 6. Limitations 更新
- 删除 "only two models at ~7B"（已过时）
- 保留：单任务(verdict prediction)、单数据集(HumanEval+MBPP)、LoRA 训练特异性

### 7. DeepSeek seed123 处理
- 91.09% 是 LoRA 初始化 + 截断边界格式崩溃（非 signal insufficiency）
- Table 中报告所有 seeds，正文注明 "training instability, analysis in Appendix"
- Appendix 加简短诊断：同 loss 但输出格式崩溃

---

## 数据来源
完整结果矩阵已在 `/root/trace-verdict-study/docs/paper/full_results_matrix.md`。
分析 artifacts 在同目录下（cross_model_exception_only_overlap.md, table1_data.md 等）。

## 引用需要验证
这次需要验证——新增了 cross-architecture 相关工作引用。

## 关键决策参考
- D053: signal-limited "suggest"→"demonstrate"
- D055: two-layer signal (markers + content)
- D056: content signal scale-invariant
- D057: ceiling 修正（99.83% floor, 100% achievable）

<details><summary>Logged reasoning block</summary>

```text
This is a major patch with significant new data and narrative changes. Let me break down what I need to do:

1. First, I need to read the current state of the paper files from the local workspace and the data sources mentioned
2. Then plan the patches systematically

Let me start by reading the data sources and current paper state. The Director mentions data is at `/root/trace-verdict-study/docs/paper/full_results_matrix.md` on the remote server, but the local paper files are at `/home/ubuntu/.agent-ml-research-idea_gen_0509_4/projects/trace-verdict-study/docs/paper/`.


I'm noticing a potential conflict here—the Director points to the remote server as the source for paper files, but my instructions state that the .tex files and related YAML files should have their source of truth locally. Let me verify this against the CLAUDE.md guidelines to clarify where the actual source files should be.

Since the data files are on the remote server but my working copies should be local, I'll start by checking the registry for the latest experiment data and then look for local copies of those data files in the artifacts directory before deciding if I need to pull anything from the remote location.
```

109	| CodeLlama-13B | 13B | 76.50% |
110	
111	**Trend:** Monotonic improvement with scale (+9.19pp from 1.5B→13B), but diminishing returns — the 1.5B→7B jump (+7.82pp) accounts for most of the gain.
112	
113	### 2. exception\_only across scale/family
114	| Model | Accuracy |
115	|-------|----------|
116	| Qwen-1.5B | 99.83% |
117	| Qwen-7B | 99.83% |
118	| CodeLlama-13B | 99.83% |
119	| DeepSeek-Coder-7B | 99.33% (seed42/456), 91.09% (seed123) |
120	
121	**Finding:** exception\_only saturates at ≥99.83% for Qwen-family and CodeLlama regardless of scale. DeepSeek achieves 99.33% on 2/3 seeds but shows one training instability (seed123=91.09%), suggesting the pattern is robust but model-family dependent in stability.
122	
123	### 3. VOTA across scale/family
124	| Model | Accuracy |
125	|-------|----------|
126	| Qwen-1.5B | 99.58% |
127	| Qwen-7B | 99.25% (mean, 2 seeds) |
128	| CodeLlama-13B | 98.57% |
129	| DeepSeek-Coder-7B | 84.45% |
130	
131	**Finding:** VOTA is highly effective (≥98.5%) for Qwen-family and CodeLlama across scales. DeepSeek-Coder significantly underperforms (84.45%), suggesting VOTA's structured trace format has family-dependent compatibility. The gap between DeepSeek VOTA (84.45%) and exception\_only (99.33%) indicates DeepSeek struggles with the multi-component VOTA format rather than the task itself.
132	
133	### 4. Trace component hierarchy (Qwen-7B)
134	```
135	no_trace (75.13%) < full_trace (81.76%) < loop_only (86.05%) ≈ label_only (86.48%)
136	  < ae_only (99.64%) < VOTA (99.25%) ≈ exception_only (99.83%)
137	```
138	
139	**Key insight:** Exception/assertion information alone nearly solves the task. The structured loop/label components provide moderate lift over raw traces. Full unstructured traces provide limited benefit (+6.63pp over no\_trace), while structured extraction yields +24pp.
