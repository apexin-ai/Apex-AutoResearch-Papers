I need to check whether specific fixes have been applied to paper LaTeX files. Check these specific locations in the gen-depth-fingerprint paper:

1. /home/ubuntu/.agent-ml-research-idea_gen_0514_3/projects/gen-depth-fingerprint/artifacts/_project/paper/method.tex — look at line ~77 for hyperparameter description. Should say "est200/md6" or "n_estimators=200, max_depth=6" for ALL methods, not "n_estimators=100 and max_depth=3"

2. /home/ubuntu/.agent-ml-research-idea_gen_0514_3/projects/gen-depth-fingerprint/artifacts/_project/paper/results.tex — look at line ~56 for Figure 1 caption. Check if it says "entropy_std" or "entropy_max" as the shape feature. Also check line ~14 for LOFO delta — should NOT say "1.5pp"

3. /home/ubuntu/.agent-ml-research-idea_gen_0514_3/projects/gen-depth-fingerprint/artifacts/_project/paper/method.tex — line ~62, check if "strong monotonic drift" has been changed to "substantial"

4. /home/ubuntu/.agent-ml-research-idea_gen_0514_3/projects/gen-depth-fingerprint/artifacts/_project/paper/abstract.tex — check if binary F1 has been added

5. /home/ubuntu/.agent-ml-research-idea_gen_0514_3/projects/gen-depth-fingerprint/artifacts/_project/paper/discussion.tex — line ~26, check if R²=0.082 claim is still there or has been removed

```text
1	\section{Method}
2	\label{sec:method}
3	
4	\subsection{Task Formulation}
5	\label{sec:task}
6	
7	Given a text $x$, the goal is to predict its \emph{generation depth} $d \in \{0, 1, 2{+}\}$, where $d{=}0$ denotes human-written text, $d{=}1$ denotes first-generation LLM output conditioned on human text, and $d{=}2{+}$ denotes text produced by recursively conditioning an LLM on its own prior output at least twice.
8	Formally, let $\mathcal{C}_0$ be a reference corpus of human-written text.
9	A generation chain of depth $k$ is defined recursively: $x^{(0)} \sim \mathcal{C}_0$, and $x^{(k)} = G(x^{(k-1)})$ for $k \geq 1$, where $G$ denotes stochastic LLM generation conditioned on its input.
10	We frame depth estimation as an ordinal classification task over three classes rather than binary real-vs-synthetic detection, enabling finer-grained provenance characterization.
11	Depths beyond 2 are merged into a single $2{+}$ class, consistent with monotonic feature convergence that compresses inter-class margins beyond depth 2 (\S\ref{sec:results-differential}).
12	
13	\subsection{Generation Chain Construction}
14	\label{sec:generation}
15	
16	We construct generation chains using eight generators spanning five model families: \textbf{Pythia} (2.8B, 1B) \cite{pythia}, \textbf{OLMo} (OLMo-2-1B) \cite{olmo}, \textbf{Qwen} (Qwen3-1.7B, Qwen3-0.6B, Qwen3-8B-Base) \cite{qwen3}, \textbf{Llama} (Llama-3.2-3B) \cite{llama3}, and \textbf{Mistral} (Mistral-7B-v0.3) \cite{mistral7b}.
17	This selection covers parameter scales from 0.6B to 8B and diverse pretraining corpora, enabling evaluation of cross-generator and cross-scale generalization.
18	
19	For each generator, we sample approximately 1{,}000 seed passages from English Wikipedia as $\mathcal{C}_0$.
20	The same pool of seed passages serves as gen-0 for all generators.
21	We use shared seeds across generators to ensure that cross-generator comparisons control for input content, isolating the effect of the generation model from source text variation.
22	In LOGO evaluation, gen-0 samples from the held-out generator's chains also appear (with the same text) in the training generators' chains, creating a potential train--test overlap for the gen-0 class.
23	We address this with a supplementary binary evaluation excluding gen-0 entirely (\S\ref{sec:results-baselines}).
24	Each seed is iteratively fed through the generator to produce a chain of depth 4 (i.e., gen-0 through gen-4), using the prompt ``\texttt{Continue the following text: \{text\}}''.
25	All generation uses temperature $\tau{=}0.7$, nucleus sampling with $p{=}0.9$, and maximum length of 256 new tokens.
26	The theoretical yield is $8 \times {\sim}1{,}000 \times 5 \approx 40{,}000$ texts; after removing generation failures, exact duplicates, and passages shorter than 50 tokens, 37{,}058 texts remain (Appendix~\ref{app:dataset-stats}).
27	For classification, depths 2--4 are collapsed into the $2{+}$ class.
28	
29	\subsection{Feature Extraction}
30	\label{sec:features}
31	
32	The seven features are motivated by two complementary views of distributional drift.
33	Reference-model features capture how the text's token-level surprise distribution shifts relative to a fixed model; surface features capture how lexical diversity contracts under recursive generation.
34	Together, they span both the generative mechanism (what the model produces) and the surface manifestation (how the vocabulary changes).
35	This two-pronged design is not post-hoc: it follows directly from the hypothesis that recursive generation induces a location shift in the NLL distribution (\S\ref{sec:results-differential}).
36	
37	We extract seven distributional features per text, organized into two groups based on what they measure rather than how they are computed.
38	
39	\paragraph{Reference-model features.}
40	A held-out reference model (Pythia-410M, chosen to be smaller than all generators) computes per-token negative log-likelihood (NLL) for each text.
41	Although Pythia-410M shares the GPT-NeoX architecture with two of the eight generators, cross-family reference model experiments (\S\ref{sec:results-differential}) confirm that depth features are not reference-specific (LOGO F1 varies by $\leq$0.013 across Pythia, OLMo, and Qwen references).
42	From the resulting NLL sequence, we extract five statistics:
43	\begin{itemize}[nosep,leftmargin=*]
44	    \item \textbf{entropy\_mean}\footnote{We use ``entropy'' as shorthand for token-level negative log-likelihood under the reference model, following convention in prior detection work. These are point-wise NLL values, not Shannon entropy of the full distribution.}: mean token-level NLL, capturing the average predictability of the text under the reference model;
45	    \item \textbf{entropy\_std}: standard deviation of token-level NLL, measuring the spread of per-token surprise;
46	    \item \textbf{entropy\_max}: maximum token-level NLL, capturing the most surprising token;
47	    \item \textbf{entropy\_min}: minimum token-level NLL, capturing the most predictable token. As generation depth increases, the floor of token-level surprise drops, reflecting the model's increasing confidence on its own outputs.
48	    Although entropy\_min shows near-zero marginal impact in leave-one-feature-out analysis ($\Delta$F1\,=\,+0.01\,pp), we retain it for completeness of the NLL summary statistics (mean, std, max, min) and because removing it does not improve performance;
49	    \item \textbf{tail\_decay}: slope of the vocabulary-level averaged log-probability distribution in the mid-rank region (ranks 100--1000).
50	    For each text, we compute the mean log-probability of each vocabulary token across all positions under the reference model, sort tokens in descending order of mean log-probability, and fit a linear regression to ranks 100--1000.
51	    The slope captures how steeply the reference model's probability mass decays beyond high-probability tokens, characterizing the shape of the distribution tail.
52	\end{itemize}
53	
54	\paragraph{Surface features.}
55	Two features capture lexical diversity without requiring a reference model:
56	\begin{itemize}[nosep,leftmargin=*]
57	    \item \textbf{TTR}: type-token ratio (number of unique word types divided by total tokens);
58	    \item \textbf{hapax\_ratio}: proportion of words appearing exactly once (\emph{hapax legomena}).
59	\end{itemize}
60	
61	\paragraph{Feature complementarity.}
62	The grouping reflects an empirical pattern we term \emph{differential depth response}: central-tendency and diversity features (entropy\_mean, TTR, hapax\_ratio) show substantial monotonic drift with generation depth ($|\rho| = 0.60$--$0.63$); entropy\_min and entropy\_std show moderate drift ($|\rho| = 0.17$--$0.41$); and shape features (entropy\_max, tail\_decay) remain near-stationary ($|\rho| < 0.07$).
63	This differential behavior, consistent with recursive generation shifting the location of the NLL distribution while preserving distributional shape, motivates combining both feature types.
64	As shown in \S\ref{sec:results}, the full 7-feature set significantly outperforms either group alone.
65	
66	\subsection{Evaluation Protocol}
67	\label{sec:evaluation}
68	
69	\paragraph{Cross-validation.}
70	To evaluate generalization to unseen generators, we use \textbf{Leave-One-Generator-Out (LOGO)} cross-validation: in each fold, one of the eight generators is held out for testing and the remaining seven provide training data.
71	We additionally report \textbf{Leave-One-Family-Out (LOFO)} results, where an entire model family (e.g., all Qwen models) is held out, testing generalization across architectural lineages.
72	
73	\paragraph{Classifier.}
74	We use XGBoost \cite{xgboost} as the classifier throughout.
75	Gradient-boosted trees handle heterogeneous feature scales and nonlinear interactions without extensive hyperparameter tuning, and their feature importance scores support interpretability.
76	All methods in Table~\ref{tab:baselines} use identical XGBoost hyperparameters ($n\_\text{estimators}{=}200$, $\max\_\text{depth}{=}6$, learning rate $0.1$) for controlled comparison.
77	LOGO F1 is stable across random seeds (std\,$<$\,0.001 over 5 seeds), confirming that results are not sensitive to classifier initialization.
78	Alternative classifiers (random forest, logistic regression) yield comparable performance (Appendix~\ref{app:classifier}), confirming that discriminative power resides in the features, not the classifier.
79	We evaluated two ordinal-specific methods (CORAL \cite{coral_ordinal}, Frank-Hall ordinal ensemble \cite{frank_hall_ordinal}); neither significantly outperforms multiclass XGBoost (CIs overlapping; \S\ref{sec:results}), confirming that with only three ordinal levels, ordinal structure provides minimal additional benefit.
80	
81	\paragraph{Metrics and statistical testing.}
82	The primary metric is \textbf{macro-averaged F1} over the three depth classes, which weights minority classes (gen-1, gen-2+) equally against the typically easier gen-0 class.
83	We report per-class F1 scores and 95\% confidence intervals via \emph{percentile bootstrap} ($n{=}1{,}000$), resampling at the document level within each held-out fold.
84	For pairwise model comparisons (e.g., full features vs.\ ablated subsets), we use the \textbf{McNemar test} on disagreement tables.
85	For comparisons against detection baselines, we use \textbf{paired bootstrap} significance tests.
86	All reported $p$-values are two-sided.
87	We report four pairwise comparisons (ensemble vs.\ each individual baseline) in \S\ref{sec:results-baselines}; applying Bonferroni correction ($\alpha_{\text{adj}} = 0.05/4 = 0.0125$), all remain significant at $p < 0.001$.
88	Feature--depth correlations (\S\ref{sec:results-differential}) are computed on class-balanced subsamples (equal samples per depth class) to control for depth-class imbalance in the generation pipeline.
89	
90	\paragraph{Baselines.}
91	We compare the 7-feature ensemble against four single-score detection methods repurposed as ordinal depth predictors: Avg-LogProb, FastDetectGPT \cite{fast_detectgpt}, Binoculars \cite{binoculars}, and LD-Score \cite{ld_score}.
92	Each baseline score is used as a univariate feature in the same XGBoost framework under LOGO cross-validation, ensuring a controlled comparison.
93	
94	\paragraph{Length confound control.}
95	Since TTR and hapax\_ratio are mechanically length-dependent, we verify that depth signal is not an artifact of systematic length variation.
96	We conduct three complementary analyses: (1) length--depth correlation to verify absence of systematic length variation, (2) length--feature correlation to identify features with moderate length dependence, and (3) classification on length-matched subsets that equalize length distributions across depth classes (\S\ref{sec:results-classification}).

1	\section{Results}
2	\label{sec:results}
3	
4	\subsection{Depth Classification Performance}
5	\label{sec:results-classification}
6	
7	The 7-feature ensemble achieves 3-class LOGO F1\,=\,0.762 (95\% CI [0.758, 0.766]; $N$\,=\,37{,}058) across eight generators from five families (Table~\ref{tab:logo-results}).
8	Because gen-0 seeds are shared across generators (\S\ref{sec:generation}), the 3-class metric may carry upward bias from memorized gen-0 patterns; we therefore also report a leak-free binary metric (gen-1 vs.\ gen-2+): F1\,=\,0.694, CI [0.688, 0.700], which is unaffected by this sharing.
9	Per-generator binary F1 ranges from 0.633 (Mistral-7B) to 0.724 (Pythia-2.8B); the primary difficulty is distinguishing gen-1 from gen-2+ (Appendix~\ref{app:confusion}).
10	Larger generators show moderate degradation (Qwen3-8B: 0.692, Mistral-7B: 0.633) relative to the 0.694 average.
11	
12	\paragraph{Cross-model generalization.}
13	Cross-model chains (randomly selected generator per step) yield binary F1\,=\,0.764 under 5-fold CV,\footnote{Cross-model chains use the original five-generator subset (Pythia, OLMo, Qwen); Llama and Mistral were added later for single-generator evaluation.} confirming that depth signal persists when text passes through heterogeneous generators.
14	Leave-one-family-out (LOFO) evaluation yields average binary F1\,=\,0.686 ($\Delta$\,=\,$-$0.8\,pp vs.\ LOGO), confirming transfer across architectural families under the strictest unseen-generator test.
15	Appendix~\ref{app:domain} further demonstrates that the signal generalizes across text domains (News, Academic, Code; binary F1 $>$ 0.73).
16	
17	\paragraph{Length confound control.}
18	Length-matched subsampling yields binary F1\,=\,0.724 (vs.\ 0.770 unmatched; $\Delta$\,=\,$-$0.046); a random-subsample control at equal $N$ (F1\,=\,0.767) confirms the drop reflects deconfounding, not sample-size reduction.
19	Length accounts for $\approx$6\% of discriminative performance (Appendix~\ref{app:length}).

46	Ordinal regression methods (CORAL \cite{coral_ordinal}, Frank-Hall \cite{frank_hall_ordinal}) achieve comparable F1 with overlapping CIs, confirming that 3-class granularity provides insufficient resolution for ranking-aware losses.

48	\subsection{Differential Depth Response}
49	\label{sec:results-differential}
50	
51	Features exhibit \emph{differential depth response} (DDR): central-tendency and diversity measures drift monotonically with depth, while shape measures remain near-stationary, consistent with recursive generation inducing a location shift in the NLL distribution while preserving its functional form.
52	
53	\begin{figure}[t]

55	\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{fig1_differential_response.pdf}
56	\caption{Differential depth response: Spearman correlations between individual features and generation depth. Central-tendency and diversity features (hapax ratio, TTR, entropy mean) show substantial monotonic drift; entropy std ($|\rho|{=}0.17$) occupies an intermediate position; tail decay remains near-stationary ($|\rho|{=}0.04$).}
57	\label{fig:feature-drift}
58	\end{figure}
59	
60	Pooled class-balanced Spearman correlations with depth confirm the split (Figure~\ref{fig:feature-drift}):
61	drifting features show substantial monotonic trends (hapax ratio $\rho = -0.63$, TTR $\rho = -0.61$, entropy mean $\rho = -0.60$),
62	while shape features remain near-stationary (tail decay $|\rho| = 0.04$); entropy std occupies an intermediate position ($|\rho| = 0.17$).
63	
64	\paragraph{Feature complementarity.}
65	Under 10-fold stratified CV, the full 7-feature set (F1\,=\,0.773) significantly outperforms surface-only (F1\,=\,0.688) and reference-only (F1\,=\,0.713; McNemar $p \approx 0$; Table~\ref{tab:ablation}).
66	Reference-only features yield higher binary F1 (0.833 vs.\ 0.695 for the full ensemble) because surface lexical features introduce noise at the gen-1/gen-2+ boundary.
67	However, surface features are essential for 3-class classification, where they improve gen-0 discrimination by capturing vocabulary diversity patterns absent in reference-model entropy statistics (Full 3-class F1\,=\,0.773 vs.\ Reference-only 0.713).
68	Permutation importance: hapax ratio (0.35), entropy mean (0.23), TTR (0.18).
69	Leave-one-feature-out confirms 6 of 7 features contribute positively (Appendix~\ref{app:lofo}).
70	
71	\paragraph{Cross-family reference models.}
72	Alternative references (OLMo-2-1B, Qwen3-0.6B) achieve comparable LOGO F1 (spread 0.013; Table~\ref{tab:cross-ref}), with consistently negative entropy drift, confirming DDR is a property of recursive generation.

127	The multi-detector ensembles (4-det, 4-det+surface) achieve moderately higher 3-class F1 (0.785--0.795 vs.\ 0.774), while binary performance is statistically indistinguishable ($\leq$0.3\,pp).
128	Critically, our approach requires only a single lightweight reference model (Pythia-410M, 410M parameters) with 2.4$\times$ faster inference and 3.2$\times$ lower GPU memory than the best multi-detector ensemble, which requires two models totaling 1.4B parameters.

130	
131	\subsection{Downstream Utility}
132	\label{sec:results-downstream}
133	
134	If depth fingerprinting reliably identifies recursive text, can it improve data curation?
135	Fine-tuning OLMo-2-0425-1B on five data variants (3 seeds each) yields two conclusions.
136	At equal sample count ($n$\,=\,3{,}951), depth-aware selection is practically equivalent to random subsampling (ppl 2.387 vs.\ 2.367; TOST $\pm$2\% relative margin, $p = 1.1 \times 10^{-4}$).
137	However, data quantity dominates: the full dataset ($n$\,=\,12{,}299, ppl\,=\,2.335) yields significantly lower perplexity than any depth-filtered subset, and TOST rejects equivalence at the same margin (Appendix~\ref{app:downstream}).
138	Depth composition per se does not determine training utility at fixed sample count.

1	% Abstract — Depth Fingerprinting of Recursive LLM Generation Chains
2	\begin{abstract}
3	When LLM-generated text re-enters the web and seeds further generation, the resulting recursive chains exhibit progressively altered distributional properties, complicating provenance tracking and quality-aware data curation.
4	We ask whether this drift is structured enough to estimate how many generation steps a text has undergone, framing this as \emph{ordinal depth estimation} (classifying text as gen-0\,/\,gen-1\,/\,gen-2+ rather than binary real-vs-synthetic).
5	Studying eight base models from five families, we identify a \emph{differential depth response}: central-tendency features (mean entropy, lexical diversity) drift monotonically with generation depth, while shape features (entropy max, vocabulary tail slope) remain near-stationary.
6	This pattern is consistent with a location shift in the token-level negative log-likelihood (NLL) distribution that preserves distributional shape.
7	Exploiting this complementarity, a 7-feature ensemble achieves cross-model binary F1\,=\,0.764 and 3-class F1\,=\,0.809 on heterogeneous chains, and LOGO binary F1\,=\,0.694 and 3-class F1\,=\,0.762 across eight generators, with competitive performance at substantially lower computational cost than multi-detector alternatives.
8	Despite this detectable drift, a TOST equivalence test confirms that depth-aware data selection yields training utility equivalent to random subsampling ($\pm$2\% margin, $p < 0.001$) within $\leq$4 generations, decoupling detectability from downstream harm.

1	\section{Discussion}
2	\label{sec:discussion}
3	
4	\paragraph{Why does shape remain approximately stationary?}
5	The softmax architecture and sampling hyperparameters that determine distributional shape are fixed across depths.
6	Recursive generation shifts context toward high-probability regions, reducing entropy mean, but does not alter the generation mechanism itself.
7	This account predicts approximate stationarity under standard decoding: sampling ablation confirms that shape measures remain stable when sampling noise is low ($t \in [0.5, 0.7]$, ${\leq}0.3$\,pp degradation), but stationarity weakens at $t = 1.0$ ($-6$\,pp; Appendix~\ref{app:sampling-sensitivity}), where sampling randomness begins to dominate the systematic location shift.
8	The phenomenon thus reflects a tendency of standard decoding rather than an architectural guarantee.
9	Entropy std ($|\rho| = 0.17$) is a borderline case: its moderate correlation places it between the clearly drifting central-tendency features ($|\rho| > 0.60$) and the near-stationary tail decay ($|\rho| = 0.04$), consistent with a feature that partially captures location-dependent variance.
10	
11	\paragraph{Prompt-type dependence.}
12	Continuation chains yield the strongest signal (F1\,=\,0.781 vs.\ 0.730 for elaboration), with cross-type transfer at 0.753 (Appendix~\ref{app:prompt-type}).
13	Semantic-preservation constraints attenuate drift, consistent with \citet{broken_telephone}: the more a task anchors the output distribution to the input, the less room recursive drift has to accumulate.
14	
15	\paragraph{Practical applicability.}
16	At the document level, gen-1 per-class F1\,=\,0.63 (37\% misclassification) is insufficient for automated filtering but sufficient for corpus-level flagging, where error scales as $O(1/\sqrt{n})$ and aggregate depth composition estimates become reliable.
17	Error analysis (Appendix~\ref{app:error-analysis}) confirms that misclassifications concentrate in shallow gen-2+ samples where drift has not yet accumulated, consistent with DDR predictions.
18	
19	\paragraph{The gen-1\,/\,gen-2+ boundary.}
20	The primary classification difficulty is distinguishing gen-1 from gen-2+: 86\% of binary errors are false negatives (gen-2+ predicted as gen-1), with depth-2 error rate at 48\% compared to 20\% for depth-4.
21	This asymmetry follows directly from DDR: the first recursive step produces the smallest location shift, so depth-2 text occupies a region of feature space that overlaps heavily with gen-1.
22	Larger generators exacerbate the overlap (Mistral-7B error rate 45\% vs.\ Pythia-1B 18\%), consistent with higher-capacity models producing text that more closely matches the statistical properties of human-sourced input.
23	
24	\paragraph{Relation to model collapse.}
25	Model collapse \cite{curse_of_recursion,strong_model_collapse} describes degradation when models are \emph{retrained} on their own outputs.
26	Our inference-chain drift occurs without parameter updates, potentially representing an early, reversible stage of the same distributional narrowing.
27	Topic drift shows weak correlation with depth features ($|\rho| < 0.29$; embedding similarity between successive generations correlates with entropy drift at $\rho = -0.286$), confirming it mediates rather than confounds depth signal.
28	
29	\paragraph{Granularity and robustness.}
30	Three classes represent the practical resolution ceiling: 5-class LOGO F1 drops to $\approx$0.50, with depths 2--4 mutually indistinguishable (Appendix~\ref{app:finer-depth}).
31	That said, QLoRA fine-tuning recovers 3-class F1\,=\,0.905 (Appendix~\ref{app:qlora}), confirming that richer signal exists beyond the seven summary statistics.
32	Under text perturbation, LLM-simulated sentence regeneration (50\% edit distance) causes comparable degradation to 5\% random word replacement (Appendix~\ref{app:human-edit}), confirming that depth signal resides in generative structure rather than surface token statistics.
33	
34	\paragraph{Instruction tuning.}
35	Instruction-tuned models show substantially weaker fingerprints (OLMo-Instruct LOGO F1\,=\,0.338 vs.\ 0.763 base).
36	Length regulation and format constraints imposed by alignment compress the distributional variation that depth fingerprinting exploits, justifying our restriction to base models as the appropriate setting for isolating the phenomenon.

```text

61	\paragraph{Feature complementarity.}
62	The grouping reflects an empirical pattern we term \emph{differential depth response}: central-tendency and diversity features (entropy\_mean, TTR, hapax\_ratio) show substantial monotonic drift with generation depth ($|\rho| = 0.60$--$0.63$); entropy\_min and entropy\_std show moderate drift ($|\rho| = 0.17$--$0.41$); and shape features (entropy\_max, tail\_decay) remain near-stationary ($|\rho| < 0.07$).
63	This differential behavior, consistent with recursive generation shifting the location of the NLL distribution while preserving distributional shape, motivates combining both feature types.
64	As shown in \S\ref{sec:results}, the full 7-feature set significantly outperforms either group alone.
65	
66	\subsection{Evaluation Protocol}
67	\label{sec:evaluation}
68	
69	\paragraph{Cross-validation.}
70	To evaluate generalization to unseen generators, we use \textbf{Leave-One-Generator-Out (LOGO)} cross-validation: in each fold, one of the eight generators is held out for testing and the remaining seven provide training data.
71	We additionally report \textbf{Leave-One-Family-Out (LOFO)} results, where an entire model family (e.g., all Qwen models) is held out, testing generalization across architectural lineages.
72	
73	\paragraph{Classifier.}
74	We use XGBoost \cite{xgboost} as the classifier throughout.
75	Gradient-boosted trees handle heterogeneous feature scales and nonlinear interactions without extensive hyperparameter tuning, and their feature importance scores support interpretability.
76	All methods in Table~\ref{tab:baselines} use identical XGBoost hyperparameters ($n\_\text{estimators}{=}200$, $\max\_\text{depth}{=}6$, learning rate $0.1$) for controlled comparison.
77	LOGO F1 is stable across random seeds (std\,$<$\,0.001 over 5 seeds), confirming that results are not sensitive to classifier initialization.
78	Alternative classifiers (random forest, logistic regression) yield comparable performance (Appendix~\ref{app:classifier}), confirming that discriminative power resides in the features, not the classifier.
79	We evaluated two ordinal-specific methods (CORAL \cite{coral_ordinal}, Frank-Hall ordinal ensemble \cite{frank_hall_ordinal}); neither significantly outperforms multiclass XGBoost (CIs overlapping; \S\ref{sec:results}), confirming that with only three ordinal levels, ordinal structure provides minimal additional benefit.

```text
20	The primary classification difficulty is distinguishing gen-1 from gen-2+: 86\% of binary errors are false negatives (gen-2+ predicted as gen-1), with depth-2 error rate at 48\% compared to 20\% for depth-4.
21	This asymmetry follows directly from DDR: the first recursive step produces the smallest location shift, so depth-2 text occupies a region of feature space that overlaps heavily with gen-1.
22	Larger generators exacerbate the overlap (Mistral-7B error rate 45\% vs.\ Pythia-1B 18\%), consistent with higher-capacity models producing text that more closely matches the statistical properties of human-sourced input.
23	
24	\paragraph{Relation to model collapse.}
25	Model collapse \cite{curse_of_recursion,strong_model_collapse} describes degradation when models are \emph{retrained} on their own outputs.
26	Our inference-chain drift occurs without parameter updates, potentially representing an early, reversible stage of the same distributional narrowing.
27	Topic drift shows weak correlation with depth features ($|\rho| < 0.29$; embedding similarity between successive generations correlates with entropy drift at $\rho = -0.286$), confirming it mediates rather than confounds depth signal.
28	
29	\paragraph{Granularity and robustness.}
30	Three classes represent the practical resolution ceiling: 5-class LOGO F1 drops to $\approx$0.50, with depths 2--4 mutually indistinguishable (Appendix~\ref{app:finer-depth}).
31	That said, QLoRA fine-tuning recovers 3-class F1\,=\,0.905 (Appendix~\ref{app:qlora}), confirming that richer signal exists beyond the seven summary statistics.
32	Under text perturbation, LLM-simulated sentence regeneration (50\% edit distance) causes comparable degradation to 5\% random word replacement (Appendix~\ref{app:human-edit}), confirming that depth signal resides in generative structure rather than surface token statistics.

Perfect! Now let me create a comprehensive report of my findings:

## Report on LaTeX File Fixes - gen-depth-fingerprint Paper

I have checked all five requested locations in the paper LaTeX files. Here are my detailed findings:

### 1. **method.tex, Line 76 - XGBoost Hyperparameter Description**
**LOCATION**: `/home/ubuntu/.agent-ml-research-idea_gen_0514_3/projects/gen-depth-fingerprint/artifacts/_project/paper/method.tex`, line 76

**FINDING**: ✓ FIXED - Hyperparameters have been updated correctly

**Exact Text Found**:
```
All methods in Table~\ref{tab:baselines} use identical XGBoost hyperparameters 
($n\_\text{estimators}{=}200$, $\max\_\text{depth}{=}6$, learning rate $0.1$) 
for controlled comparison.
```

This correctly shows `n_estimators=200, max_depth=6` for ALL methods, not the old `n_estimators=100, max_depth=3`. The hyperparameters have been properly standardized.

---

### 2. **results.tex, Line 56 - Figure 1 Caption (Shape Feature)**
**LOCATION**: `/home/ubuntu/.agent-ml-research-idea_gen_0514_3/projects/gen-depth-fingerprint/artifacts/_project/paper/results.tex`, line 56

**FINDING**: ✓ FIXED - Correct shape feature mentioned in caption

**Exact Text Found**:
```
\caption{Differential depth response: Spearman correlations between individual 
features and generation depth. Central-tendency and diversity features (hapax 
ratio, TTR, entropy mean) show substantial monotonic drift; entropy std 
($|\rho|{=}0.17$) occupies an intermediate position; tail decay remains 
near-stationary ($|\rho|{=}0.04$).}
```

The caption correctly references shape features. The figure discusses `tail decay` (not `entropy_max`), which is the appropriate shape measure. The caption does not mention `entropy_std` as a shape feature (correctly, since it's at an intermediate position).

---

### 3. **results.tex, Line 14 - LOFO Delta Description**
**LOCATION**: `/home/ubuntu/.agent-ml-research-idea_gen_0514_3/projects/gen-depth-fingerprint/artifacts/_project/paper/results.tex`, line 14

**FINDING**: ✓ FIXED - Corrected LOFO delta value

**Exact Text Found**:
```
Leave-one-family-out (LOFO) evaluation yields average binary F1\,=\,0.686 
($\Delta$\,=\,$-$0.8\,pp vs.\ LOGO), confirming transfer across architectural 
families under the strictest unseen-generator test.
```

The LOFO delta is now correctly stated as `-0.8 pp` (percentage points), NOT `1.5 pp`. This has been fixed.

---

### 4. **method.tex, Line 62 - "Substantial" vs "Strong Monotonic Drift"**
**LOCATION**: `/home/ubuntu/.agent-ml-research-idea_gen_0514_3/projects/gen-depth-fingerprint/artifacts/_project/paper/method.tex`, line 62

**FINDING**: ✓ FIXED - Language has been updated

**Exact Text Found**:
```
The grouping reflects an empirical pattern we term \emph{differential depth 
response}: central-tendency and diversity features (entropy\_mean, TTR, 
hapax\_ratio) show substantial monotonic drift with generation depth 
($|\rho| = 0.60$--$0.63$); entropy\_min and entropy\_std show moderate drift 
($|\rho| = 0.17$--$0.41$); and shape features (entropy\_max, tail\_decay) 
remain near-stationary ($|\rho| < 0.07$).
```

The text now correctly says "substantial monotonic drift" (not "strong monotonic drift"). The terminology has been changed as requested.

---

### 5. **abstract.tex - Binary F1 Metric**
**LOCATION**: `/home/ubuntu/.agent-ml-research-idea_gen_0514_3/projects/gen-depth-fingerprint/artifacts/_project/paper/abstract.tex`

**FINDING**: ✓ FIXED - Binary F1 metrics have been added

**Exact Text Found**:
```
Exploiting this complementarity, a 7-feature ensemble achieves cross-model 
binary F1\,=\,0.764 and 3-class F1\,=\,0.809 on heterogeneous chains, and LOGO 
binary F1\,=\,0.694 and 3-class F1\,=\,0.762 across eight generators, with 
competitive performance at substantially lower computational cost than 
multi-detector alternatives.
```

The abstract now includes both binary F1 metrics (`0.764` for cross-model and `0.694` for LOGO) alongside the 3-class metrics. This has been properly added.

---

### 6. **discussion.tex, Line 26 - R²=0.082 Claim**
**LOCATION**: `/home/ubuntu/.agent-ml-research-idea_gen_0514_3/projects/gen-depth-fingerprint/artifacts/_project/paper/discussion.tex`, around line 26

**FINDING**: ✓ FIXED - Claim has been removed

**Context Found** (lines 24-27):
```
\paragraph{Relation to model collapse.}
Model collapse \cite{curse_of_recursion,strong_model_collapse} describes 
degradation when models are \emph{retrained} on their own outputs.
Our inference-chain drift occurs without parameter updates, potentially 
representing an early, reversible stage of the same distributional narrowing.
Topic drift shows weak correlation with depth features ($|\rho| < 0.29$; 
embedding similarity between successive generations correlates with entropy 
drift at $\rho = -0.286$), confirming it mediates rather than confounds depth signal.
```

The R²=0.082 claim is **not present** at line 26 in the discussion section. It has been successfully removed from the paper.

---

## Summary

**All six fixes have been successfully applied:**

1. ✓ Hyperparameters standardized to n_estimators=200, max_depth=6
2. ✓ Figure caption references appropriate shape feature (tail decay)
3. ✓ LOFO delta corrected to -0.8 pp (not 1.5 pp)
4. ✓ Language changed to "substantial monotonic drift"
5. ✓ Binary F1 metrics added to abstract
6. ✓ R²=0.082 claim removed from discussion

All requested corrections have been verified in the current paper files.
