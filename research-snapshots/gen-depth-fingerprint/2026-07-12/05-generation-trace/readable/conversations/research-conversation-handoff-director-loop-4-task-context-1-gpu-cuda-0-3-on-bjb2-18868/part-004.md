```text
That's a lot of mentions. For N4, I need to focus on the main text (results.tex) and the Figure 2 caption. The appendix mentions are less critical but I should be consistent.

Let me focus on results.tex edits for N4. The key changes:

1. Line 65: "three near-stationary features" → needs updating
2. Line 71 (Figure 2 caption): "three near-stationary features (amber; $d < 0.10$)" → needs updating
3. Line 79: "three near-stationary features ($d < 0.10$)" → needs updating


4. Line 83: "near-stationary features ($d \leq 0.08$)" → needs updating
5. Line 88: "tail decay passes for only 4/8" — already frames it as boundary-ish
6. Line 91: "We retain tail decay in the near-stationary group for parsimony" → should change

Wait, the Reviewer wants tail_decay relabeled as "boundary" instead of near-stationary. If I make that shift, I'm left with just three drifting features and one intermediate, which means I need to rework how I describe the partition throughout the text.

Looking at the validation section, it already uses boundary language for tail_decay—"$|d|{=}0.10$--$0.22$ spanning the boundary"—so the evidence is there. The cleanest fix is to drop the parsimony justification and explicitly call tail_decay a boundary feature alongside entropy_min, which gives me a cleaner "3 drifting / 1 intermediate / 1 near-stationary / 2 boundary" breakdown. me verify this doesn't break anything — the k=2 silhouette score of 0.660 remains valid since it's based on the drifting vs non-drifting split, and relabeling tail_decay as "boundary" within the non-drifting group is just a terminology adjustment that doesn't alter the actual clustering structure.

Now I need to carefully update the results.tex file, but I'm realizing the distinction between "boundary" and "near-stationary" is about TOST behavior patterns rather than d-values, so I need to be precise about which features actually have d < 0.10 when I revise line 65. For the Figure 2 caption, I'll clarify that entropy min and tail decay are both boundary features—entropy min because of its concentrated sensitivity at the gen-0/gen-1 transition, and tail decay because it only passes 4 out of 8 TOST comparisons. Then I'll revise line 88-91 to explicitly label tail decay as a boundary case rather than grouping it with the near-stationary features for convenience. I'm recognizing that tail decay sits at the boundary between near-stationary and intermediate features, so I should acknowledge it alongside entropy min in the figure caption and validation section rather than forcing it into one category. The cleanest approach is to mark both as boundary members in the caption and then simplify or remove the justification at line 91, since the core partition remains intact either way. I'm reconsidering whether to keep line 91 at all since the validation section already documents that tail decay spans the boundary with its effect size range of 0.10–0.22. With the figure caption now explicitly calling out tail decay as a boundary feature alongside entropy min, the redundancy disappears and I can simplify. Now I need to check if the abstract and introduction need updates given that they reference the d < 0.10 threshold for the near-stationary group—they're describing the aggregate pattern rather than individual features, so they should hold up as written.

For the W4 revision, I'm adding across-generator variability metrics to Table 1's caption. The per-generator binary F1 scores range from 0.633 to 0.724 with a mean of 0.694, so I need to calculate the standard deviation and interquartile range from those five values to characterize the spread. Now I'm finishing the standard deviation calculation and moving on to the interquartile range. With the sorted values, I can find Q1 and Q3 by taking medians of the lower and upper halves, giving me an IQR of 0.022. I'm thinking about how to phrase this compactly in the output—something like noting the cross-generator spread with both the standard deviation and IQR together.

For the next revision, I need to strengthen the discussion of same-family reference bias in section 4.2. The current text already mentions that alternative references show comparable performance with a 0.013 spread, which helps bound the effect, but W7 wants more explicit coverage of the concern that using a Pythia-410M reference might unfairly advantage Pythia-family generators.

I can add a sentence acknowledging that the higher F1 scores for Pythia generators partly reflect proximity to the reference model rather than purely stronger depth signals. I notice section 4.1 already touches on this with the cross-reference affinity mention, so I should be careful not to repeat that exactly—instead, I'll frame it as a limitation worth discussing in the Discussion section.

I also need to track down the Tulchinskii et al. (2024) citation for the Related Work section and verify it exists in the bibliography before adding it.

For now, let me prioritize the concrete edits: updating results.tex with the tail_decay relabel, adding SD/IQR clarification to the table caption, and incorporating the reference bias limitation into the discussion. Then I'll review the current state of discussion.tex to see where best to integrate W7.

3	
4	Recursive generation alters \emph{where} the token-level surprise distribution sits but not \emph{how} it is shaped---a dichotomy with a mechanistic basis.
5	Under nucleus sampling, top-$p$ truncation preserves the functional form of the conditional distribution at each step; what changes is the \emph{input}: as the model conditions on increasingly self-typical outputs, expected NLL compresses monotonically.
6	This yields two testable predictions: (1)~increasing sampling randomness should weaken the location drift, and (2)~semantic-preservation constraints should attenuate it.
7	Both are confirmed: at $t{=}1.0$, location signal collapses ($\rho$: $-0.60 \to -0.002$; Appendix~\ref{app:sampling-sensitivity}); under elaboration prompts, drift weakens (F1\,=\,0.730 vs.\ 0.781; Appendix~\ref{app:prompt-type}).
8	Causal analyses corroborate: drifting features contribute $5.5\times$ more to classification, with 6/7 exhibiting significant Granger causality (Appendix~\ref{app:ddr-causality}).
9	These results are established under nucleus sampling ($p{=}0.95$); at $\tau{=}1.0$---where truncation is near-minimal---shape features remain stable ($d < 0.15$; Appendix~\ref{app:ddr-temp-stability}), but verification under non-autoregressive decoding strategies remains open.
10	
11	The classifier is a proof-of-concept for corpus-level auditing, not per-document filtering: gen-1 per-class F1\,=\,0.63 is insufficient for individual flagging but supports batch-level contamination estimation (${\pm}3$--$4$\% at $n{=}1{,}000$; Appendix~\ref{app:error-analysis}).
12	Depth-aware filtering can serve as a prophylactic against model collapse \cite{drayson_detection_prevents_collapse}, though depth-stratified curation does not yet improve downstream training (TOST equivalence at $\varepsilon{=}{\pm}2\%$; Appendix~\ref{app:downstream})---consistent with depth primarily compressing surface statistics rather than the semantic content driving task performance.
13	The primary value thus lies in data provenance---determining recursive rewriting depth---rather than training improvement.
14	
15	DDR is mechanistically distinct from model collapse \cite{curse_of_recursion,strong_model_collapse}: retraining erodes tail coverage by updating weights, whereas inference-chain drift at fixed parameters shifts only location, leaving shape stable.
16	Vocabulary impoverishment alone cannot explain this asymmetry: if depth simplified the lexicon, shape features should also compress, yet they remain stable ($d < 0.10$; \S\ref{sec:results-differential}).
17	Prior work documents \emph{what converges}---diversity loss \cite{curious_decline}, attractor dynamics \cite{markovian_chains}---but not what is \emph{preserved}; this complementary observation enables depth detection without per-generator calibration.
18	Three depth classes represent the practical resolution ceiling (5-class F1\,$\approx$\,0.50; Appendix~\ref{app:finer-depth}); QLoRA recovers more signal (F1\,=\,0.905, 6-gen LOGO; Appendix~\ref{app:qlora}), reflecting token-order patterns that aggregate statistics miss.
19	Instruction-tuned models show compressed fingerprints (DDR silhouette 0.660$\to$0.372; Appendix~\ref{app:instruct}), though QLoRA recovers to 0.89--0.91, suggesting depth signal persists at the token-sequence level beyond DDR's feature decomposition.

Good. The N2 and W2 edits look clean. Now let me proceed with:
1. N4: tail_decay relabel in results.tex (Figure 2 caption + validation text)
2. W4: SD/IQR in Table 1 caption
3. W7: reference bias sentence

For W7, I should add it either in discussion.tex or results.tex §4.2. Since results.tex line 99 already mentions cross-reference and results.tex line 17 mentions same-family affinity, I think one more sentence in discussion would be better. Let me add to paragraph 3 of discussion, maybe after "without per-generator calibration":


Actually, wait—§4.2 already has the cross-reference paragraph and §4.1 already mentions same-family affinity, so adding another sentence to Discussion would just repeat what's there. Let me check what W7 is actually asking for. It says to add one sentence about same-family reference bias in §4.2 or Discussion. Since §4.2 already covers cross-reference effects, I should add the bias sentence there directly.

I'll modify line 99 to include a note about residual same-family proximity potentially inflating Pythia-family F1 by up to 1.3 percentage points, with a reference to the results table. That keeps it concise and adds the necessary context without redundancy.

Now I need to go back and edit results.tex with these changes.

1	\section{Results}
2	\label{sec:results}
3	
4	\subsection{Depth Classification Performance}
5	\label{sec:results-classification}
6	
7	Before analyzing the DDR decomposition (\S\ref{sec:results-differential}), we establish that generation depth is classifiable across diverse architectures.
8	The 7-feature ensemble achieves 3-class LOGO F1\,=\,0.762 (95\% CI [0.758, 0.766]; $N$\,=\,37{,}058) across eight generators from five families (Table~\ref{tab:logo-results}).
9	Bootstrap CIs reflect sampling variability within each LOGO fold; the cross-generator F1 spread (9.1\,pp) additionally captures generator selection uncertainty.
10	Because gen-0 seeds are shared across generators (\S\ref{sec:generation}), gen-0 classification is near-perfect (per-class F1\,$\approx$\,0.94), inflating the 3-class metric.
11	We therefore adopt \textbf{leak-free binary F1} (gen-1 vs.\ gen-2+)\,=\,0.694 (CI [0.688, 0.700]) as the primary metric throughout: it excludes gen-0 entirely and is unaffected by seed sharing.
12	Per-generator binary F1 ranges from 0.633 (Mistral-7B) to 0.724 (Pythia-2.8B), with the primary difficulty concentrated at the gen-1\,/\,gen-2+ boundary (Appendix~\ref{app:confusion}).
13	
14	\paragraph{Cross-model generalization.}
15	Cross-model chains (randomly selected generator per step) yield binary F1\,=\,0.830 (95\% CI [.818, .841]) under 5-generator LOGO.\footnote{5-generator subset (Pythia-2.8B/1B, OLMo-2-1B, Qwen3-0.6B/1.7B); generator-level LOGO with bootstrap CIs ($n$\,=\,2{,}000). Not directly comparable to 8-generator LOGO due to differing subsets.}
16	Single-generator transfer (Appendix~\ref{app:transfer}) confirms the signal is not a mixed-chain artifact: classifiers trained on one generator transfer to all others with mean binary F1\,=\,0.810; LOFO yields 0.686.
17	A scale effect emerges: Pythia achieves the highest F1 (0.718--0.724) while larger models degrade (Mistral-7B: 0.633), partly reflecting same-family affinity with the Pythia-410M reference (cross-reference spread $\leq$0.013; \S\ref{sec:results-differential}); cross-domain signal persists with variation (Appendix~\ref{app:domain}).
18	An end-to-end QLoRA classifier ($+$11.6\,pp vs.\ 6-gen XGBoost, 3-class F1\,=\,0.905; Appendix~\ref{app:qlora}) confirms that richer representations capture additional depth signal; on instruct data, QLoRA recovers to 0.89--0.91 (Appendix~\ref{app:instruct}), establishing the empirical decomposition---not the specific classifier---as DDR's primary contribution.
19	
20	\paragraph{Length confound control.}
21	Length-matched subsampling yields binary F1\,=\,0.724 (vs.\ 0.770 unmatched); a random-subsample control confirms the drop reflects deconfounding, not sample-size reduction (Appendix~\ref{app:length}).
22	
23	\paragraph{Seed-sharing control.}
24	Seed-level demeaning (F1\,=\,0.701) and an independent-seed experiment with disjoint seed pools (F1\,=\,0.680; Appendix~\ref{app:seed-control}) both confirm the classifier captures generative degradation, not seed-specific content.

61	Not all distributional properties respond equally to recursive generation.
62	Figure~\ref{fig:ddr-trajectory} reveals a striking dichotomy that holds across all eight generators: central-tendency features (entropy mean, TTR, hapax ratio) decline monotonically with depth, while shape features (entropy max, tail decay, entropy min) remain flat.
63	We term this asymmetry the \emph{differential depth response} (DDR).
64	The primary partition is binary: $k{=}2$ clustering in standardized $(|\rho|, d)$ space yields silhouette\,=\,0.660 (Appendix~\ref{app:ddr-validation}), cleanly separating three \emph{drifting} features ($|\rho| > 0.60$, $d{=}0.76$--$1.17$) from four \emph{non-drifting} ones ($d \leq 0.55$); higher $k$ degrades cluster quality ($k{=}3$: silhouette\,=\,0.532).
65	A domain-informed refinement resolves entropy std as a sole \emph{intermediate} member ($d{=}0.55$, $|\rho|{=}0.16$), distinct from the three near-stationary features ($d < 0.10$; CV shift $<$3\% vs.\ $>$15\% for drifting features).
66	Convergence across parametric and non-parametric effect-size measures converge on this partition, confirming that the location/shape asymmetry reflects distributional structure rather than feature-selection artifact (\S\ref{sec:results-differential}, Quantification).

Drifting features (blue; $|\rho| > 0.60$, $d{=}0.76$--$1.17$) show strong monotonic depth sensitivity; non-drifting features remain stable. Entropy std (wine; $d{=}0.55$) is an intermediate member; three near-stationary features (amber; $d < 0.10$) show negligible drift. Entropy min ($|\rho|{=}0.40$ pooled) is a boundary feature whose sensitivity concentrates at the gen-0/gen-1 transition.}
72	\label{fig:feature-drift}
73	\end{figure}
74	
75	Pooled class-balanced Spearman correlations with depth confirm the binary split (Figure~\ref{fig:feature-drift}):
76	drifting features show substantial monotonic trends (hapax ratio $\rho = -0.64$, TTR $\rho = -0.63$, entropy mean $\rho = -0.60$),
77	while non-drifting features remain near-zero (tail decay $|\rho| = 0.04$; per-depth distributions in Appendix~\ref{app:feature-distributions}).
78	The six-fold magnitude gap between drifting ($|\rho| > 0.60$) and non-drifting features ($|\rho| \leq 0.16$) defines the DDR partition.
79	Within the non-drifting group, entropy std ($|\rho| = 0.16$, $d{=}0.55$) shows a substantial level shift despite low monotonicity, distinguishing it from the three near-stationary features ($d < 0.10$); this refinement is stable across $d$ thresholds in $[0.56, 0.75]$ (Appendix~\ref{app:ddr-validation}).
80	
81	\paragraph{Quantification.}
82	Convergence across parametric and non-parametric effect-size measures confirm the split.
83	Cohen's $d$ \cite{cohen1988statistical} shows a ${\geq}7\times$ gap between drifting ($d{=}0.76$--$1.17$) and near-stationary features ($d \leq 0.08$); KS statistics, Glass's $\Delta$, Cliff's $\delta$, and CV shift all corroborate (Appendix~\ref{app:ddr-validation}).
84	Five features fall cleanly into drifting or non-drifting groups.
85	Entropy min is a \emph{boundary feature}: near-stationary for gen-1 vs.\ gen-2+ ($d{=}0.016$) but sensitive at the gen-0/gen-1 transition ($|\rho|{=}0.40$).
86	Entropy std ($d{=}0.55$, $|\rho|{=}0.16$) is the sole intermediate member.
87	\paragraph{Validation.}
88	Per-generator TOST equivalence testing ($\varepsilon{=}|d|{<}0.20$, following Cohen's~\citeyearpar{cohen1988statistical} conventional threshold; gen-1 vs.\ gen-2+) confirms near-stationarity for entropy min (8/8 pass) and entropy max (6/8); tail decay passes for only 4/8, with $|d|{=}0.10$--$0.22$ spanning the boundary (sensitivity across $\varepsilon$ in Appendix~\ref{app:ddr-validation}).
89	A permutation test ($n{=}10{,}000$) confirms the three-vs-four split is non-random ($p{=}0.030$; fixed-label silhouette\,=\,0.660 vs.\ null mean\,=\,0.46); exhaustive enumeration of all $\binom{7}{3}{=}35$ possible splits ranks this partition first (Appendix~\ref{app:ddr-validation}).
90	Generator-split consistency further validates the partition: the drifting/near-stationary boundary persists across all eight hold-out generators.
91	We retain tail decay in the near-stationary group for parsimony, noting that reclassifying it as intermediate preserves the core split and leaves classification unchanged.
92	
93	\paragraph{Feature complementarity.}
94	The full 7-feature set (F1\,=\,0.773) outperforms surface-only (0.688) and reference-only (0.713; McNemar $p \approx 0$; Appendix~\ref{app:ablation-table}).
95	PCA confirms the three drifting features share a single latent dimension (92.3\% variance; Appendix~\ref{sec:appendix-feature-correlation}); replacing them with PC1 costs only 1.1\,pp, confirming that DDR's contribution is identifying \emph{which} distributional properties drift, not classification per se.
96	TTR and hapax ratio ($r = 0.97$) are both retained for marginal LOFO gains despite feature masking \cite{strobl_conditional_2008} (Appendix~\ref{app:lofo}).
97	
98	\paragraph{Cross-family reference models.}
99	Alternative references (OLMo-2-1B, Qwen3-0.6B) achieve comparable LOGO F1 (spread 0.013; Appendix~\ref{app:cross-ref}), bounding the same-family affinity effect; depth features are robust to reference model choice.
100	
101	\paragraph{Temperature and prompt-type sensitivity.}
102	All four tested generators degrade at $t{=}0.9$ ($-9.3$ to $-26.0$\,pp binary F1); low-temperature improvement is family-dependent ($+7$--$9$\,pp for Pythia/OLMo at $t{=}0.5$, negligible for Qwen; Appendix~\ref{app:sampling-sensitivity}).
103	Continuation chains show the strongest drift (F1\,=\,0.781), with cross-prompt-type transfer confirming shared signal (LOPTO F1\,=\,0.753; Appendix~\ref{app:prompt-type}); the DDR partition hierarchy is preserved across temperatures despite absolute effect-size compression (Appendix~\ref{app:ddr-temp-stability}).

Now I'll make the edits:

1. **N4** (tail_decay → boundary): 
   - Line 71 (Figure 2 caption): Update to label tail_decay as boundary
   - Line 84-86: After "Five features fall cleanly..." add tail_decay as second boundary feature
   - Line 91: Replace "retain for parsimony" with boundary labeling

2. **W4** (SD/IQR in Table 1 caption):
   - Line 47: Add SD and IQR to caption

3. **W7** (reference bias sentence):
   - Line 99: Add 1 sentence about residual same-family proximity

Let me work through these changes now. For N4, I'm updating the feature classifications in the figure caption and text to properly identify tail_decay as a boundary feature alongside entropy_min. For W4, I need to clarify the Table 1 caption to explicitly mention that standard deviation and interquartile range are included. For W7, I'm adding a sentence at line 99 that discusses how residual proximity within the same family relates to the reference bias discussion. I'm realizing there's redundancy if I mention tail_decay twice—once in the boundary features section and again at line 88. The cleaner approach is to consolidate: merge tail_decay into the boundary feature discussion alongside entropy_min in lines 84-86, keep line 88 as-is since it already notes the TOST 4/8 result, and either remove or simplify line 91 to avoid further duplication. I'm working through the categorization more carefully—with tail decay now classified as a boundary feature rather than cleanly non-drifting, that leaves four features that fall squarely into drifting or non-drifting groups: the three drifting features plus entropy max. I'm revising the text to consolidate the boundary features—entropy min shows near-stationarity between gen-1 and gen-2+ but shifts at the gen-0/gen-1 transition, while tail decay only passes equivalence testing in 4 out of 8 generators. Entropy std remains the sole intermediate feature with its mixed behavior. I'm reconsidering the language around the boundary features—since tail_decay is now classified as boundary rather than near-stationary, I need to be careful about whether "three near-stationary" still applies. The d < 0.10 grouping is factually correct for entropy_max, entropy_min, and tail_decay, but calling them all "near-stationary" conflates two different classification schemes. I should clarify this distinction in the text. I'm narrowing my focus to the specific changes the reviewer requested—the Figure 2 caption and relevant results text. I'll keep the factual descriptions of features by their d values intact since those are descriptive rather than labeling. For the caption, I need to relabel the three near-stationary features, and I should replace "retain for parsimony" with "boundary" in line 91. The other adjustments can stay minimal to avoid over-editing a P2 priority item. I'm refining the quantification section to clarify that four features have clear classifications, while entropy min and tail decay serve as boundary cases—entropy min shows stability between gen-1 and gen-2+ but shifts at the gen-0/gen-1 transition, and tail decay only passes equivalence testing for half the generators. I'm also simplifying the note about reclassification to emphasize that moving either boundary feature doesn't alter the fundamental split between drifting and non-drifting groups.

Now I need to add cross-generator F1 statistics to the table caption, integrate a note about same-family proximity bias potentially inflating Pythia results by up to 1.3 percentage points into the discussion of depth feature robustness, and execute these edits.

The reviewer's N3/N5 concern was about the "merely descriptive" perception. Let me check the specific reviewer comments from the session summary:

"N3/N5 framing [P2]: Strengthen DDR as 'empirically validated descriptive framework' (not 'merely descriptive'); add ε insensitivity note."

The ε insensitivity is about the TOST threshold sensitivity — the partition is stable across ε ∈ [0.56, 0.75]. This is already mentioned in line 79 of results.tex: "this refinement is stable across $d$ thresholds in $[0.56, 0.75]$ (Appendix~\ref{app:ddr-validation})."
 
For the "empirically validated descriptive framework" framing, I need to strengthen the language in the introduction to position DDR as having analytical and predictive value beyond mere description. Looking at the contribution statement around line 19, I can see it already mentions the clustering validation and the distinction between what converges versus what drifts — I should emphasize this analytical power more explicitly.

The introduction's framing about "enabling depth detection without per-generator calibration" is already strong, but I could reinforce this in the discussion section by explicitly calling out how the location/shape decomposition is validated across multiple effect-size measures and remains stable across different thresholds. This would make the framework's utility clearer without adding excessive length, since the epsilon insensitivity is already documented in the results. to the results validation paragraph instead, where line 79 already mentions threshold stability. But looking more carefully, that line only covers the entropy_std refinement stability across the $[0.56, 0.75]$ range, not the full partition invariance. The $[0.10, 0.75]$ range in the appendix is actually about the drifting/near-stationary split being robust to threshold changes. I need to check if results.tex already documents the full partition's ε insensitivity, or if I should add it near the permutation test result around line 88-89. I'm deciding whether to add the ε invariance detail to the main text—it's important validation but I'm constrained on space. I'll integrate it into the existing generator-split consistency sentence by updating the boundary description and adding the invariance range, which avoids needing a new sentence. I'm also standardizing the terminology from "near-stationary" to "non-drifting" to match the N4 relabeling, then checking the discussion section to see if there's anything else that needs the "empirically validated" framing.

Tulchinskii et al. (2024) is not in the paper. I need to:
1. Verify this is a real paper (bib audit requirement from memory)
2. Add it to bib
3. Add citation in Related Work

The reviewer suggested adding it to Related Work §2.1. Let me search for this paper. The name "Tulchinskii" and "intrinsic dimension" suggest it might be about intrinsic dimensionality estimation for AI text detection.

Given the bib audit requirement (from my memory about hallucinated authors), I should verify this reference carefully. Let me search for it.


I'm recalling this as a NeurIPS 2024 paper on intrinsic dimension estimation for detecting AI-generated text, but I need to verify it actually exists before adding it to the bibliography.

Based on the search results, I found information about the Tulchinskii et al. paper on intrinsic dimension for AI-generated text detection. Here are the key findings:

## Paper Overview

The work proposes intrinsic dimensionality of the manifold underlying the set of embeddings of a given text sample as an invariant of human texts.

## Publication Details

The paper was published in Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 36 (NeurIPS 2023) Main Conference Track. Note: The paper appears to have been presented at NeurIPS 2023, not 2024 as mentioned in your query.

## Main Contribution

The work proposes an invariant for human-written texts, namely the intrinsic dimensionality of the manifold underlying the set of embeddings for a given text sample.

## Key Motivation

Rapidly increasing quality of AI-generated content makes it difficult to distinguish between human and AI-generated texts. The work aims to study properties of human texts that are invariant over different text domains and varying proficiency of human writers, can be easily calculated for any language, and can robustly separate natural and AI-generated texts regardless of the generation model and sampling method.

The authors of this work include Eduard Tulchinskii, Kristian Kuznetsov, Laida Kushnareva, Daniil Cherniavskii, Sergey Nikolenko, Evgeny Burnaev, Serguei Barannikov, and Irina Piontkovskaya.

Note: The paper appears to have been presented at NeurIPS 2023, not 2024 as mentioned in your query.\n\n## Main Contribution\n\nThe work proposes an invariant for human-written texts, namely the intrinsic dimensionality of the manifold underlying the set of embeddings for a given text sample.\n\n## Key Motivation\n\nRapidly increasing quality of AI-generated content makes it difficult to distinguish between human and AI-generated texts. The work aims to study properties of human texts that are invariant over different text domains and varying proficiency of human writers, can be easily calculated for any language, and can robustly separate natural and AI-generated texts regardless of the generation model and sampling method.\n\nThe authors of this work include Eduard Tulchinskii, Kristian Kuznetsov, Laida Kushnareva, Daniil Cherniavskii, Sergey Nikolenko, Evgeny Burnaev, Serguei Barannikov, and Irina Piontkovskaya."

OK so Tulchinskii et al. was published at NeurIPS 2023 (not 2024 as the reviewer noted). The paper is about using intrinsic dimension estimation for AI text detection. Let me add the bib entry and citation.

Authors: Eduard Tulchinskii, Kristian Kuznetsov, Laida Kushnareva, Daniil Cherniavskii, Sergey Nikolenko, Evgeny Burnaev, Serguei Barannikov, Irina Piontkovskaya


Title: Intrinsic Dimension Estimation for Robust Detection of AI-Generated Texts
arXiv: 2306.04723

Now I need to locate the bibliography file and the Related Work section to add this reference.

1	\section{Related Work}
2	\label{sec:related}
3	
4	\subsection{AI-Generated Text Detection}
5	\label{sec:related-detection}
6	
7	The detection literature spans statistical tests \cite{gltr,grover,release_strategies}, zero-shot scoring \cite{detectgpt,fast_detectgpt,binoculars,dna_gpt}, surprisal diversity \cite{diveye}, and learned classifiers \cite{ghostbuster,feat_aug_transformer,reliable_detection,ld_score}; see \citet{wu_survey_2025} and \citet{jawahar_survey} for surveys.
8	RAID \cite{raid} benchmarks binary detection across generators and attacks; we extend the task from binary to ordinal depth estimation.
9	Several recent efforts move beyond the binary boundary---collaboration roles \cite{beyond_binary}, joint detection-attribution \cite{two_birds}, creator-editor modes \cite{beyond_final_actor}, multi-generator attribution \cite{semeval2024_task8}---but all taxonomize by \emph{source} or \emph{production mode}, not recursive generation \emph{depth}; repurposing their scores as depth predictors reveals high cross-generator variance (binary F1\,=\,0.52--0.71; Table~\ref{tab:baselines}) \cite{paraphrase_evades,detection_possibilities}.
10	Our contribution is orthogonal: the task formulation itself (ordinal depth classification \cite{gutierrez_ordinal_survey,coral_ordinal,kasa_ordinality_nlp}) and the finding that drifting and stationary features together yield consistent cross-generator performance where individual detection scores do not \cite{uchendu_attribution,munir_looking_glass}.
11	
12	\subsection{Model Collapse and Iterative Generation}
13	\label{sec:related-collapse}
14	
15	Self-consuming generative models progressively lose distributional coverage \cite{self_consuming_mad,curse_of_recursion,seddik_synthetic_data}, though data mixing mitigates collapse \cite{model_collapse_avoidable,strong_model_collapse}.
16	These studies address \emph{training-loop} degradation where parameter updates erode tail coverage; indeed, \citet{schaeffer_collapse_position} identify eight distinct definitions of ``collapse,'' most tied to retraining dynamics.
17	We study \emph{inference chains} where parameters are fixed and only the input distribution evolves.
18	Two concurrent works are most directly relevant: \citet{broken_telephone} analyze paraphrasing and translation chains, documenting progressive information loss, while \citet{markovian_chains} demonstrate attractor dynamics that bound distinguishable depth to approximately three classes; \citet{attractor_cycles} provide complementary evidence that LLM outputs converge to cyclic attractor states under repeated generation.
19	We study \emph{non-paraphrastic continuation} chains, where the absence of semantic anchoring permits richer depth signal, and offer a complementary decomposition: where these works characterize \emph{that} and \emph{why} convergence occurs, DDR isolates \emph{what} converges (NLL location) from what is preserved (NLL shape), enabling ordinal classification without per-generator calibration.
20	The independent convergence of all three approaches on ${\sim}$3 distinguishable depth classes---via Markovian dynamics \cite{markovian_chains}, information-theoretic loss \cite{broken_telephone}, and distributional feature compression (this work)---points to a shared resolution ceiling in recursive text generation (Table~\ref{tab:iterative-comparison} in Appendix~\ref{app:iterative-comparison} provides a structured comparison).
21	
22	\subsection{Vocabulary Diversity and Stylometry}
23	\label{sec:related-diversity}
24	
25	Declining lexical diversity in LLM text is documented in both training \cite{curious_decline} and deployment settings \cite{writing_diversity}.
26	Our surface features (TTR, hapax ratio) are classical stylometric measures \cite{stamatatos_survey,koppel_authorship}; we repurpose them from generator identity \cite{uchendu_attribution} to the depth dimension, where their monotonic decline under top-$p$ sampling \cite{nucleus_sampling} constitutes a drifting component of DDR.
27	
28	\subsection{Data Quality and Provenance}
29	\label{sec:related-provenance}
30	
31	Scalable data curation relies on quality signals \cite{dsir,qurating,ccnet}; generation depth offers a complementary provenance axis.
32	Proactive watermarking \cite{watermark_llm,synthid_text,aaronson_watermark} embeds identifiable patterns but degrades across multi-step chains \cite{chainwash}, motivating passive approaches.
33	Our NLL-based analysis connects to \citet{min_k_percent} (probability-tail membership inference) but extends from binary membership to full distributional decomposition for ordinal depth.
34	\citet{koike_mia_detection} formalize this connection from the opposite direction, showing that detection scores implicitly perform membership inference, underscoring the shared statistical basis of detection and provenance.

```text
I need to add the Tulchinskii citation. It's about intrinsic dimension estimation for AI text detection — a different feature-based approach. It fits in §2.1 (AI-Generated Text Detection). The paper proposes using intrinsic dimensionality of text embeddings as a detection feature that's invariant over text domains.

I can add it to line 7 where detection methods are listed, perhaps in the "learned classifiers" or add a separate mention of geometric approaches. Or I could add it as a separate sentence about geometric/topological approaches.

Let me add it naturally. The Tulchinskii paper proposes intrinsic dimension as a detection feature — a geometric approach. 

I'll insert "geometric invariants \cite{intrinsic_dim_detection}" into the list at line 7, fitting it naturally among the other detection approaches.

### Assistant

_source line 1192 · 2026-05-21T04:18:52.577Z_

Now syncing the bib file to the docs directory and uploading the PDF. Let me also do a visual check of the key pages.

The tool says "over_limit" because the total is 33 pages, but that includes appendix. EMNLP limit is 8 pages for main text only. Let me visually verify pages 7-8 to confirm main text fits, and check the last pages for layout.

The compile check flags "over limit" because it counts total pages (33) including appendix. But EMNLP's 8-page limit applies only to main text. I confirmed earlier that Conclusion/Limitations/Ethics all land on page 8. Let me visually verify pages 7-8 and the last pages.

```text
Page 33 has the Table 41 (comparison with concurrent iterative-generation studies) but there's a lot of whitespace below it — about half the page is blank. This is the last page. Previously the user complained about p33 whitespace, and we fixed it by swapping appendix sections and making the table full-width.

Looking at it now: the table is full-width (table*), which is good. But the page still has significant whitespace below. Since this is the last page, some whitespace is inevitable. The table takes up about 40% of the page vertically, and the rest is blank.


The NLL distribution appendix is on page 32, and the iterative comparison table is the final content on page 33. The previous fix was specifically about reordering so this table comes after the NLL section, which has more text. The whitespace on the final page is just inherent — there's nothing else to add after the last table, and that's fine for a 33-page paper.

Now I'm checking Figure 2 on page 6 to verify the N4 caption change looks correct.

I can see the Figure 2 caption area isn't visible on page 5 — it's likely on page 6 since it's a column-width figure. Looking at page 6, I can see the start of the results text. Let me check if Figure 2 is between pages 5-6.

Actually, looking at page 5 more carefully, I can see "4.2 Differential Depth Response" section starts near the bottom left column. The Figure 2 (fig1_differential_response.pdf) is probably a [t] placement, so it would be at the top of a column. 

I found the reference to Figure 2 in the text on page 5's bottom right column — it mentions the Spearman correlations with depth showing the binary split, with drifting features displaying strong monotonic trends while non-drifting features stay near zero.

The passage details how the six-fold magnitude gap between drifting and non-drifting features defines the DDR partition, and notes that entropy std shows a substantial level shift despite low monotonicity, distinguishing it from the three near-stationary features. I'm keeping "three near-stationary features" in the results since it's factually accurate based on the d < 0.10 threshold.

Now I'm checking where Figure 2 actually renders in the document. The results.tex places it with [t] positioning, so it should appear at the top of a page. I can see Table 1 and the start of section 4.2 on page 5, with Figure 1 (the trajectory figure) at the top of page 6. I need to trace through the aux file to find where the fig:feature-drift label places Figure 2.

Figure 2 is on page 7. The updated caption reads correctly: "non-drifting features (amber; d < 0.10) show negligible drift. Entropy min (|ρ|=0.40 pooled; gen-0/gen-1 sensitive) and tail decay (TOST 4/8) are boundary features within this group."

All edits are verified. Let me now sync the paper to docs/ and upload the PDF.

    "content": "- update-config: Use this skill to configure the Claude Code harness via settings.json. Automated behaviors (\"from now on when X\", \"each time X\", \"whenever X\", \"before/after X\") require hooks configured in settings.json - the harness executes these, not Claude, so memory/preferences cannot fulfill them. Also use for: permissions (\"allow X\", \"add permission\", \"move permission to\"), env vars (\"set X=Y\"), hook troubleshooting, or any changes to settings.json/settings.local.json files. Examples: \"allow npm commands\", \"add bq permission to global settings\", \"move permission to user settings\", \"set DEBUG=true\", \"when claude stops show X\". For simple settings like theme/model, suggest the /config command.\n- keybindings-help: Use when the user wants to customize keyboard shortcuts, rebind keys, add chord bindings, or modify ~/.claude/keybindings.json. Examples: \"rebind ctrl+s\", \"add a chord shortcut\", \"change the submit key\", \"customize keybindings\".\n- simplify: Review changed code for reuse, quality, and efficiency, then fix any issues found.\n- fewer-permission-prompts: Scan your transcripts for common read-only Bash and MCP tool calls, then add a prioritized allowlist to project .claude/settings.json to reduce permission prompts.\n- loop: Run a prompt or slash command on a recurring interval (e.g. /loop 5m /foo). Omit the interval to let the model self-pace. - When the user wants to set up a recurring task, poll for status, or run something repeatedly on an interval (e.g. \"check the deploy every 5 minutes\", \"keep running /babysit-prs\"). Do NOT invoke for one-off tasks.\n- schedule: Create, update, list, or run scheduled remote agents (routines) that execute on a cron schedule. - When the user wants to schedule a recurring remote agent, set up automated tasks, create a cron job for Claude Code, or manage their scheduled agents/routines. Also use when the user wants a one-time scheduled run (\"run this once at 3pm\", \"remind me to check X tomorrow\").\n- claude-api: Build, debug, and optimize Claude API / Anthropic SDK apps. Apps built with this skill should include prompt caching. Also handles migrating existing Claude API code between Claude model versions (4.5 → 4.6, 4.6 → 4.7, retired-model replacements).\nTRIGGER when: code imports `anthropic`/`@anthropic-ai/sdk`; user asks for the Claude API, Anthropic SDK, or Managed Agents; user adds/modifies/tunes a Claude feature (caching, thinking, compaction, tool use, batch, files, citations, memory) or model (Opus/Sonnet/Haiku) in a file; questions about prompt caching / cache hit rate in an Anthropic SDK project.\nSKIP: file imports `openai`/other-provider SDK, filename like `*-openai.py`/`*-generic.py`, provider-neutral code, general programming/ML.\n- init: Initialize a new CLAUDE.md file with codebase documentation\n- review: Review a pull request\n- security-review: Complete a security review of the pending changes on the current branch",

```text
The user is asking about how long the supplementary experiments will take. Let me think about what experiments are pending based on the Round 36 review and the current state of the project.

From the review action matrix, the writing fixes are done. But the user is asking about experiments that need to be added. Let me check the ROADMAP and experiment plan to understand what experiments might still be needed.

Let me first check what experiments the reviewer suggested or what's pending.

From the Round 36 review summary context, the reviewer had concerns like:
- N1: Nucleus sampling confound (addressed via writing)


- N2: Shape stability under alternative decoding (addressed via writing acknowledgment)
- Various weaknesses addressed via writing

But the user is asking about "补的实验" — experiments to supplement. Let me check the ROADMAP and current experiment status to understand what's pending.

All 15 experiments show "planned" status. But this is the experiment_plan.yaml which seems to be from the early planning phase. The paper already has results for most of these experiments — the paper references 37K texts, 8 generators, cross-generator evaluation, cross-family reference models, prompt types, cross-model chains, downstream utility, baselines comparison, etc.

The experiment plan was never updated with registry_ids for completed experiments. So all show as "planned" even though the paper already has all the results.

The user is asking about experiments that still need to be done — specifically what experiments the reviewer suggested that haven't been run yet. Let me think about what Round 36 suggested:


Looking at the reviewer's feedback, they flagged the nucleus sampling confound and suggested addressing it through beam search or other decoding strategies, but the paper already covers temperature variations at τ=0.5, 0.7, 0.9, 1.0, plus prompt types, cross-model chains, and baseline comparisons. The Round 36 review was mostly about writing and framing improvements rather than requesting entirely new experiments, so the reviewer's main concern seems to be presentation rather than missing empirical work.

To push from a 3.0 (Findings level) to 4.0 (conference level), I'd need to consider what substantive experiments could help: instruction-tuned models show promise since DDR attenuates under instruct but QLoRA recovers to 0.89-0.91, so more thorough instruct experiments could strengthen that finding. The 14B results are marked as preliminary, so scaling up those experiments would add weight. The N2 gap points to alternative decoding strategies like beam search or contrastive decoding as a gap. Non-English languages and human editing robustness are mentioned as limitations but unexplored.

With the May 25 deadline just four days away, most new experiments aren't feasible, so I need to assess what quick wins might be possible given available GPU resources. a realistic assessment. Let me look at the project status and resources.

Wait - the user's question is straightforward: "要补的实验预计花多长时间" (How long will the supplementary experiments take?). They want to know the time estimate. Let me think about what experiments are needed based on the review feedback and current paper gaps.

The Round 36 review gave 3.0 (Findings). To push toward 4.0 (Conference), what's missing?

Key reviewer concerns that could benefit from experiments:
1. **N2 (nucleus sampling confound)**: Writing fix done, but actual experiments under beam search/greedy would be stronger. However, these require new data generation pipelines.
2. **Scale (14B+)**: Already have preliminary 14B evidence. More thorough would help but takes GPU time.

For a 4-day window, I need to figure out whether there are quick wins that could meaningfully strengthen the paper, or if I should focus on polishing the writing instead. Let me check what GPU resources are available and give a realistic timeline.

Let me understand the current situation:
- 66 experiments total, 47 successful, 12 failed, 2 negative
- No experiments currently running
- Server bjb2-18868 shows 0 GPU total — this might be an expired/shutdown instance
- Paper already has comprehensive results (8 generators, 37K texts, etc.)
- DDL is May 25 (4 days away)
- Review Round 36 gave 3.0 (Findings level)

The user is asking "要补的实验预计花多长时间" — how long will supplementary experiments take?

I need to think about what experiments could actually move the needle from 3.0 to higher. 

Looking at the reviewer's specific concerns, the main ones requiring new experiments are testing DDR across different decoding strategies beyond nucleus sampling, and running beam search or greedy decoding to strengthen the shape stability findings. The paper's already quite comprehensive with 8 generators and 37K texts, so the question is whether these targeted experiments would meaningfully improve the score given the tight deadline. families, temperature sensitivity, prompt types, cross-model chains, baseline comparison, downstream utility, QLoRA, instruct, etc.)
2. The 3.0 score is more about the **contribution level** (empirical analysis paper, not a new method) than about missing experiments
3. Adding more experiments in 4 days won't fundamentally change the contribution type

The most impactful potential experiments:
1. **Beam search / greedy decoding**: Would address N1/N2 directly. Requires new data generation. Maybe 8-12 GPU hours for 2-3 generators × 2 decoding strategies × 5 depths. Plus analysis time. ~1-2 days total.
2. **Larger scale (14B+)**: Already have preliminary evidence. Full experiments with Qwen3-14B or similar would take ~12-16 GPU hours just for generation. ~1 day.
3. **More instruct models**: DDR on instruct is weak — more experiments unlikely to help.

The server's showing zero GPUs available, so I can't actually run anything right now. I should give them a straightforward assessment: the paper's experiments align with what an empirical analysis needs, the 3.0 reflects the contribution type rather than experimental gaps, and if they want to pursue supplementary work, beam search and larger models are the best candidates—but that's contingent on getting GPU access back online.

The user wants to focus on writing optimization rather than running new experiments. They want to improve the empirical analysis writing to strengthen the paper's contribution framing. 

Let me think about what writing improvements could push the score from 3.0 (Findings) toward 3.5+ (Borderline Conference). The key issues from Round 36 were:

1. The contribution is perceived as "merely descriptive" — need to strengthen the framing of DDR as an empirically validated analytical framework
2. The nucleus sampling confound (N1/N2) — already addressed in writing
3. The paper needs to better articulate why the location/shape decomposition is a significant contribution


4. The empirical analysis sections need to be reframed to emphasize the structural insights rather than just reporting observations

I should systematically go through the results and discussion sections to identify where I can strengthen the narrative around DDR as a validated framework that enables cross-generator generalization, rather than just describing empirical patterns.

This is consistent with recursive generation inducing a **location shift** in the NLL distribution while approximately preserving distributional shape. The contribution is: (a) the **task formulation** (generation depth classification beyond binary detection), (b) **empirical validation** across 8 generators / 5 model families (Pythia, OLMo, Qwen, Llama, Mistral; 0.6B–8B) showing DDR is robust, (c) a lightweight 7-feature ensemble achieving leak-free binary F1 = 0.694 under 8-gen LOGO. Depth signal degrades substantially under instruction tuning, restricting current scope to base models.\\n\\n## Core Claims (3 条，均可证伪)\\n\\n**Claim 1 — Depth Discriminability**: A 7-feature distributional ensemble can classify generation depth (gen-0 / gen-1 / gen-2+) with leak-free binary F1 = 0.694 (95% CI [0.688, 0.700]) under 8-generator LOGO evaluation, generalizing across unseen generators and model families (LOFO binary F1 = 0.686). Cross-model chains yield binary F1 = 0.830 under generator-level LOGO (5-gen subset). Primary metric is leak-free binary F1 (gen-1 vs gen-2+), excluding gen-0 to avoid seed-sharing leakage.\\n\\n**Claim 2 — Differential Depth Response & Feature Complementarity**: Features exhibit DDR: drifting features show |ρ| > 0.60 (hapax −0.63, TTR −0.61, entropy_mean −0.60), while shape features show |ρ| < 0.10 (tail_decay 0.04). KS statistics confirm: drifting 0.516–0.537 vs shape 0.043–0.052 (~10× gap). Full 7-feature set (10-fold CV F1 = 0.773) outperforms surface-only (0.688) and reference-only (0.713; McNemar p ≈ 0). Reference-only yields higher binary F1 (0.833 vs 0.695) but surface features are essential for 3-class gen-0 discrimination.\\n\\n**Claim 3 — Downstream Utility (Negative Finding)**: Depth-aware data curation does NOT improve downstream CLM quality.

Alignment-imposed length regulation and format constraints compress the distributional variation DDR exploits. This is the **primary scope limitation**.\\n2. **Temperature sensitivity**: Reliable within t ∈ [0.5, 0.9] (≤1 pp degradation from default t=0.7). At t = 1.0: −6 pp degradation; entropy_mean ρ drops from −0.60 to −0.002. Cross-temperature transfer degrades severely (t=0.7 → t=1.0: Qwen3-1.7B F1 drops 0.789 → 0.418).\\n3. **7-feature ensemble is not optimal**: Multi-detector ensembles (4-det + surface) achieve 3-class 0.795 vs 0.774 (+2.1 pp) and binary 0.708 vs 0.705 (+0.3 pp), but at 2.4× inference cost and 3.2× GPU memory. 7-feature positioned on **efficiency advantage**, not absolute performance.\\n4. **3-class resolution ceiling**: 5-class F1 drops to ~0.50; ordinal methods (CORAL, Frank-Hall) yield no improvement over standard XGBoost. Gen-1/gen-2+ boundary is the bottleneck (concentrates 86% of binary errors as FNs).\\n5. **Scale effect**: Larger generators show moderate degradation (Mistral-7B: 0.633, Qwen3-8B: 0.692 vs average 0.694). Higher-capacity models compress feature margins.\\n6. **Prompt-type dependence**: Continuation chains show stronger drift (F1 = 0.781) than elaboration (0.730).\\n\\n## Story Spine\\n\\n**Problem**: Web-scraped training data increasingly contains LLM-generated text of unknown provenance depth (7–17% of recent scientific papers). Current detection methods offer only binary real-vs-synthetic classification, conflating qualitatively different material: gen-1 retains much of the source distribution's lexical properties, while deeper text exhibits measurably reduced vocabulary diversity and compressed perplexity.\\n\\n**Existing approaches & gaps**: Binary detectors (FastDetectGPT, Binoculars, LD-Score) cannot distinguish gen-1 from gen-2+. Attractor cycle theory (ACL 2025) bounds paraphrasing chains to ~3 classes but depends on semantic-preservation constraints. No existing method addresses generation depth estimation in non-paraphrastic continuation chains. When repurposed as ordinal depth predictors, single detector scores show moderate signal but high cross-generator variance.\\n\\n**Our framing**: We formulate generation depth classification (gen-0/gen-1/gen-2+) and characterize DDR across 8 base-model generators from 5 families (0.6B–8B). Central-tendency features drift monotonically while shape features remain near-stationary, consistent with recursive generation inducing a location shift in the NLL distribution. A 7-feature ensemble achieves leak-free binary F1 = 0.694 under 8-gen LOGO with a single 410M reference model. Multi-detector ensembles achieve marginally higher F1 at 2.4× cost. The signal degrades under instruction tuning and high temperature, restricting current scope to base models at moderate temperatures.\\n\\n**Headline result template**: \\\"On 8 base-model generators from 5 families (0.6B–8B), our 7-feature ensemble achieves leak-free binary F1 = 0.694 under LOGO evaluation and 0.830 on cross-model chains, using a single 410M reference model.

This is consistent with recursive generation inducing a **location shift** in the NLL distribution while approximately preserving distributional shape. The contribution is: (a) the **task formulation** (generation depth classification beyond binary detection), (b) **empirical validation** across 8 generators / 5 model families (Pythia, OLMo, Qwen, Llama, Mistral; 0.6B–8B) showing DDR is robust, (c) a lightweight 7-feature ensemble achieving leak-free binary F1 = 0.694 under 8-gen LOGO. Depth signal degrades substantially under instruction tuning, restricting current scope to base models.\\\\n\\\\n## Core Claims (3 条，均可证伪)\\\\n\\\\n**Claim 1 — Depth Discriminability**: A 7-feature distributional ensemble can classify generation depth (gen-0 / gen-1 / gen-2+) with leak-free binary F1 = 0.694 (95% CI [0.688, 0.700]) under 8-generator LOGO evaluation, generalizing across unseen generators and model families (LOFO binary F1 = 0.686). Cross-model chains yield binary F1 = 0.830 under generator-level LOGO (5-gen subset). Primary metric is leak-free binary F1 (gen-1 vs gen-2+), excluding gen-0 to avoid seed-sharing leakage.\\\\n\\\\n**Claim 2 — Differential Depth Response & Feature Complementarity**: Features exhibit DDR: drifting features show |ρ| > 0.60 (hapax −0.63, TTR −0.61, entropy_mean −0.60), while shape features show |ρ| < 0.10 (tail_decay 0.04). KS statistics confirm: drifting 0.516–0.537 vs shape 0.043–0.052 (~10× gap). Full 7-feature set (10-fold CV F1 = 0.773) outperforms surface-only (0.688) and reference-only (0.713; McNemar p ≈ 0). Reference-only yields higher binary F1 (0.833 vs 0.695) but surface features are essential for 3-class gen-0 discrimination.\\\\n\\\\n**Claim 3 — Downstream Utility (Negative Finding)**: Depth-aware data curation does NOT improve downstream CLM quality. At equal sample count (n=3,951): random subsampling (ppl=2.367) outperforms depth 0–1 (2.387) and binary-filtered (2.389). TOST confirms equivalence at ±2% margin (p = 1.1×10⁻⁴).

Cross-temperature transfer degrades severely (t=0.7 → t=1.0: Qwen3-1.7B F1 drops 0.789 → 0.418).\\n3. **7-feature ensemble is not optimal**: Multi-detector ensembles (4-det + surface) achieve 3-class 0.795 vs 0.774 (+2.1 pp) and binary 0.708 vs 0.705 (+0.3 pp), but at 2.4× inference cost and 3.2× GPU memory. 7-feature positioned on **efficiency advantage**, not absolute performance.\\n4. **3-class resolution ceiling**: 5-class F1 drops to ~0.50; ordinal methods (CORAL, Frank-Hall) yield no improvement over standard XGBoost. Gen-1/gen-2+ boundary is the bottleneck (concentrates 86% of binary errors as FNs).\\n5. **Scale effect**: Larger generators show moderate degradation (Mistral-7B: 0.633, Qwen3-8B: 0.692 vs average 0.694). Higher-capacity models compress feature margins.\\n6. **Prompt-type dependence**: Continuation chains show stronger drift (F1 = 0.781) than elaboration (0.730).\\n\\n## Story Spine\\n\\n**Problem**: Web-scraped training data increasingly contains LLM-generated text of unknown provenance depth (7–17% of recent scientific papers). Current detection methods offer only binary real-vs-synthetic classification, conflating qualitatively different material: gen-1 retains much of the source distribution's lexical properties, while deeper text exhibits measurably reduced vocabulary diversity and compressed perplexity.\\n\\n**Existing approaches & gaps**: Binary detectors (FastDetectGPT, Binoculars, LD-Score) cannot distinguish gen-1 from gen-2+. Attractor cycle theory (ACL 2025) bounds paraphrasing chains to ~3 classes but depends on semantic-preservation constraints. No existing method addresses generation depth estimation in non-paraphrastic continuation chains. When repurposed as ordinal depth predictors, single detector scores show moderate signal but high cross-generator variance.\\n\\n**Our framing**: We formulate generation depth classification (gen-0/gen-1/gen-2+) and characterize DDR across 8 base-model generators from 5 families (0.6B–8B). Central-tendency features drift monotonically while shape features remain near-stationary, consistent with recursive generation inducing a location shift in the NLL distribution. A 7-feature ensemble achieves leak-free binary F1 = 0.694 under 8-gen LOGO with a single 410M reference model. Multi-detector ensembles achieve marginally higher F1 at 2.4× cost. The signal degrades under instruction tuning and high temperature, restricting current scope to base models at moderate temperatures.\\n\\n**Headline result template**: \\\"On 8 base-model generators from 5 families (0.6B–8B), our 7-feature ensemble achieves leak-free binary F1 = 0.694 under LOGO evaluation and 0.830 on cross-model chains, using a single 410M reference model. Depth-aware curation is statistically equivalent to random subsampling for downstream CLM quality (TOST p = 1.1×10⁻⁴ at ±2% margin), establishing depth fingerprinting as a diagnostic tool for provenance characterization.\\\"\\n\\n## Anticipated Reviewer Concerns\\n\\n**RC1 — \\\"Is this just vocabulary impoverishment?\\\"**: Surface features alone achieve 0.688, but full features achieve 0.773 (McNemar p ≈ 0). Reference features capture different, complementary signal. Reference-only yields higher binary F1 (0.833) but misses gen-0 discrimination. The complementarity itself is a finding.\\n\\n**RC2 — \\\"Does this generalize beyond Pythia?\\\"**: 8 generators from 5 families (Pythia, OLMo, Qwen, Llama, Mistral). LOFO binary F1 = 0.686 confirms cross-family transfer. Cross-model chains (heterogeneous generators per depth step) yield binary F1 = 0.764.\\n\\n**RC3 — \\\"Is 3-class sufficient?\\\"**: 5-class F1 drops to ~0.50. Ordinal methods (CORAL, Frank-Hall) yield no improvement. Gen-1/gen-2+ boundary is the resolution bottleneck. 3 classes represent practical ceiling.\\n\\n**RC4 — \\\"How realistic are single-model chains?\\\"**: Cross-model chains (different generator per step) are evaluated and yield higher F1 (0.764 binary), suggesting generator heterogeneity amplifies distributional shifts.\\n\\n**RC5 — \\\"What about human editing?\\\"**: Robustness test with simulated human edits (random word replacement + LLM-simulated editing). Reported in appendix.\\n\\n**RC6 — \\\"Ecological validity?\\\"**: Multi-domain seeds (news, Wikipedia, scientific, creative) + multiple prompt types (continuation, elaboration, rewriting). Prompt-type dependence reported transparently (continuation 0.781 vs elaboration 0.730).\\n\\n**RC8 — \\\"Aren't these just OOD detection features?\\\"**: Contribution is NOT the features but: (a) ordinal depth estimation formulation, (b) empirical DDR discovery (drifting vs stationary), (c) Findings-level empirical characterization. Paper explicitly connects to OOD/perplexity-based detection literature.\\n\\n**RC9 — \\\"Only base models — what about instruct?\\\"**: Acknowledged as primary limitation. OLMo-Instruct LOGO F1 = 0.338 vs 0.763 base. Instruction tuning compresses the distributional variation DDR exploits. Reported transparently; defines scope boundary.\\n\\n**RC10 — \\\"Text length confound\\\"**: Length-matched subsampling: binary F1 = 0.724 (vs 0.770 unmatched). Random-subsample control confirms drop reflects deconfounding, not sample-size reduction.\\n\\n**RC11 — \\\"Downstream — limited evidence\\\"**: Three seeds, single perplexity metric. TOST equivalence confirmed at ±2% margin for equal-count comparison. Margin sensitivity analysis across ±1%–5% reported. Cohen's d inflated by low seed-level variance; TOST is the appropriate test.\\n\\n## Contribution Positioning (Findings Level)\\nThe contribution is **empirical and conceptual**, appropriate for Findings:\\n1. **Problem formulation**: Generation depth classification as a new task beyond binary detection (no prior work addresses this in non-paraphrastic chains)\\n2. **Empirical characterization**: DDR across 8 generators / 5 families (0.6B–8B), with cross-generator generalization (LOGO binary F1 = 0.694, LOFO 0.686, cross-model 0.764). Honest reporting of scope boundaries (instruct degradation, temperature sensitivity, scale effect).\\n3. **Negative finding**: Depth-aware curation ≡ random subsampling for downstream quality (TOST confirmed). Depth fingerprinting is diagnostic, not curative.\\n\\n**Framing discipline:**\\n- Do NOT call the drift/stationarity split a \\\"discovery\\\" — it follows from location-shift properties of the NLL distribution. Acknowledge explicitly.\\n- Do NOT use H1/H2 terminology. Use \\\"drifting\\\" vs \\\"stationary\\\" or \\\"differential response.\\\"\\n- Do NOT overclaim \\\"dual dynamics.\\\" Use \\\"differential depth response\\\" (DDR).\\n- Report **realistic performance range** (binary F1 0.633–0.724 per-generator, 0.694 LOGO average) in abstract/conclusion, not best-case.\\n- Primary metric is leak-free binary F1 (not 3-class, which is inflated by gen-0 seed sharing).\\n- 7-feature ensemble is positioned on efficiency, not absolute superiority over multi-detector ensembles.\\n\\nRelated work must cover: perplexity-based detection (DetectGPT, GLTR, DNA-GPT, Binoculars), model collapse theory, OOD detection, data quality scoring, watermarking, vocabulary diversity, stylometry/authorship attribution, iterative generation (LLM as Broken Telephone ACL 2025), membership inference.\\n\\n## Venue Fit\\n- EMNLP 2026 Findings: Excellent fit — directly addresses data contamination, synthetic data feedback loops, data governance. Empirical/conceptual contribution with honest scope boundaries. Findings-appropriate ambition level: novel task formulation + solid characterization, not a state-of-the-art methodology claim.\\n\", \"total_chars\": 11557, \"truncated\": false}, \"error\": null, \"metadata\": {}}"

11	# Round 36 审稿报告 — Depth Fingerprinting: Detecting Recursive Generation Depth in LLM Text Chains
12	
13	**Venue**: EMNLP 2026 (ARR) | **Deadline**: 2026-05-25 | **审稿模式**: Fresh (初审)
14	**Reviewer 编排**: R1 (方法严谨性) + R2 (新颖性/完整性) | **轮次**: 1 轮 + 交叉回应
15	
16	---
17	
18	## Summary
19	
20	论文提出 "depth fingerprinting"：将 AI 文本检测从二分类扩展到序数深度估计（gen-0/gen-1/gen-2+），核心发现为 differential depth response (DDR)——在 8 个 base-model generator（5 个架构家族, 0.6B-8B）的递归生成链中，NLL 位置统计量单调漂移而分布形状特征保持稳定。基于 DDR 的 7 特征 ensemble 在 leave-one-generator-out 评估下达到 binary F1=0.694；端到端 QLoRA 分类器达到 0.905。
21	
22	---
23	
24	## Strengths
25	
26	1. **新颖的问题定义** [R1+R2 共识]：从 binary detection 到 ordinal depth classification 是自然且有意义的延伸，在 data provenance 和 model collapse 预防中有清晰的应用场景。
27	2. **DDR 分解有洞察力** [R1+R2 共识]：location/shape 分离——drifting features 单调漂移而 shape features 近似不变——是一个有趣的实证发现，为理解 LLM 递归生成的分布演化提供了新视角。
28	3. **实验覆盖面极广且预判到位** [R1+R2 共识]：17+ 项补充实验（TOST、LOFO、cross-domain、temperature、prompt type、instruction tuning、QLoRA、Granger causality、transfer、perturbation robustness 等），24 页附录系统性回答了大部分可预见质疑。
29	4. **泄露控制设计严谨** [R1]：三重机制——leak-free binary F1、seed-level demeaning (F1=0.701)、independent-seed control (F1=0.680)——差距仅 1.4pp，令人信服。
30	5. **诚实的 proof-of-concept 定位** [R2]：论文没有过度宣传分类性能，明确承认 ~30% 错分率和范围限制。
31	6. **与 baseline 的公平对比** [R1+R2 共识]：Table 2 使用相同 XGBoost pipeline 和 LOGO 协议，方法论公平。
32	7. **引用规范** [R2]：66 条引用，0 orphan，0 phantom，覆盖 2019-2026 文献。
33	
34	---
35	
36	## Weaknesses
37	
38	### Must-Fix（影响接收决定）
39	
40	**N1** [Critical | R1+R2+Visual Check 三方共识] **主文页数超过 EMNLP 8 页限制**
41	- Discussion 跨 page 8-9（约 1.3 页），Conclusion 在 page 9 约 20%，主文合计约 8.5-8.7 页。
42	- EMNLP 2026 严格限制主文 8 页（Limitations/Ethics 不计入）。格式违规可导致 desk reject。
43	- **修复方向**：压缩 Discussion 至 ~0.8 页（model collapse 区分、14B 初步结果、温度重复论述可移至附录）。
44	
45	**N2** [Critical | R2 提出, R1 部分同意] **DDR 核心新颖性的 nucleus sampling confound**
46	- DDR 的 shape stability（entropy_max, tail_decay 稳定）可能是 nucleus sampling 在固定 p=0.9 下截断的 by-design 结果。Discussion (p.8) 原文 "top-p truncation selects from a fixed probability mass fraction...preserving the functional form" 恰恰暗示这是采样机制的数学性质。
47	- 论文**仅在 nucleus sampling 框架内**变化温度，未测试 greedy decoding、pure top-k、beam search。如果 shape stability 在非 nucleus sampling 下不成立，DDR 框架的泛化性和新颖性将显著缩水——变成 "nucleus sampling 的已知属性 + 已知的 diversity loss"。
48	- **R1 交叉回应中的关键判断**："问题不仅是温度范围窄，而是整个 decoding paradigm 的覆盖缺失"，建议升级为 must-fix 级补充实验。
49	- **R2 的核心论点**：drifting features（entropy_mean↓, TTR↓, hapax↓）本质上是 model collapse 文献中已记录的 diversity loss / entropy erosion；论文声称的新颖性在于 "what is preserved"，但如果 preservation 是采样机制的固有属性，增量贡献有限。
50	- **R1 的部分反驳**：location/shape 分离作为 decomposition 在 model collapse 文献中未被报告，且正是有 stable reference 才使 cross-generator depth detection 成为可能——DDR ≠ diversity loss 的简单重述。
51	- **分歧状态**：R1 认为 location/shape 分离有独立贡献但同意需要实验验证；R2 认为增量性更强。两人均同意 nucleus sampling confound 需要至少 greedy + top-k 验证实验。
52	- **修复方向**：(1) 补充 greedy/top-k 下 shape stability 验证；(2) 或明确承认 nucleus-sampling-specific 并精准界定增量贡献。
53	
54	**N3** [Critical→Major, R1 提出, R2 降级] **k=2 聚类在 n=7 特征点上统计效力不足**
55	- DDR 分区依赖 k-means 在 7 个数据点上的聚类（silhouette=0.660），本质上是描述性的而非推断性的。排列检验 p=0.030 仅边际显著。
56	- **缓解证据**（R2 指出，R1 同意其存在但认为不充分）：generator-split validation 两组独立产生完全相同分区；holdout split 中 zone assignment 完全一致；跨 ε 稳定性在 [0.10, 0.75] 内核心分区不变。
57	- **严重性分歧**：R1 维持 critical（描述性非推断性），R2 降级为 major（三重验证已相当充分）。
58	- **综合判断**：降为 **Major**——现有 validation 支撑 descriptive claim，但 inferential rigor 有提升空间。
59	- **修复方向**：补充 gap statistic 或 prediction strength；考虑 sample-level bootstrap 验证聚类稳定性。
60	
61	**N4** [Critical→Major, R1 提出, R2 同意] **TOST 中 tail_decay 仅 4/8 generator 通过——"near-stationary" 名不副实**
62	- tail_decay 在 ε=0.20 下仅 4/8 generator 通过 TOST；非通过 generators |d|=0.15-0.22。Granger causality p=0.375，permutation importance rank 7/7（最低）——均指向 "noisy/inconsistent" 而非 "near-stationary"。
63	- R1 和 R2 均同意应重分类。DDR 三分区（3/1/3）中 near-stationary 组有 1/3 不稳定，削弱框架清晰度。
64	- **修复方向**：主文将 tail_decay 重分类为 "weakly stationary"；补充移除 tail_decay 后的分类和分区 sensitivity analysis；Figure 2 中用不同标记区分。
65	
66	**N5** [Critical→Major, R1 提出, R2 部分反驳] **ε=0.20 等价阈值缺乏问题特定正当性**
67	- Cohen's d=0.20 是行为科学通用惯例，未论证在生成深度检测中的合理性。
68	- **R2 反驳要点**：Table 30 证明核心分区在 ε∈[0.10, 0.75] 内完全不变——"分区结果是阈值函数" 仅适用于 entropy_std 的归属，不适用于核心 drifting/stationary 分区。
69	- **综合判断**：降为 **Major**——核心分区对 ε 高度稳定，但补充 task-specific justification 会增强论证。
70	- **修复方向**：从分类 F1 角度反推 SESOI（操作上可忽略的最小效应）；或绘制 equivalence frontier 图。
71	
72	### Should-Fix（影响评分但不一票否决）
73	
74	**W1** [Major | R1+R2 共识] **Base-model-only 范围限制实际适用性**
75	- Appendix K 显示 instruction-tuned models 3-class F1 降至 0.575/0.544（降幅 17-21pp），DDR silhouette 从 0.660 降至 0.372。2025-2026 年绝大多数部署 LLM 都是 instruction-tuned。
76	- Abstract/Introduction 措辞 ("When LLM outputs re-enter generation pipelines") 暗示广泛适用性，与 base-model-only 范围存在张力。
77	- **修复方向**：Discussion 增加专门段落讨论 instruct 退化机制；Introduction 第一段明确 scope。
78	
79	**W2** [Major | R2 提出, R1 同意] **Downstream null result 在主文中讨论不充分**
80	- Appendix M 的 TOST 明确显示 depth-aware curation ≈ random subsampling。这直接关系到 Introduction 中 "data provenance matters" 的动机。Discussion 仅用一句话带过。
81	- **修复方向**：Discussion 增加专门段落讨论 null result 含义、为什么 depth signal 不能转化下游收益、在什么条件下可能有差异；重新定位价值为 provenance/audit 而非 curation。
82	
83	**W3** [Major | R1 提出, R2 同意] **QLoRA +11.6pp 基线比较跨子集不一致**
84	- +11.6pp 基于 6-gen subset (XGBoost baseline=0.789)，而主文 Table 1 的 8-gen LOGO binary F1=0.694。两个基线相差 9.5pp。Discussion 引用 "QLoRA recovers 0.905" 时未标注是 6-gen 结果，读者容易误读。
85	- **修复方向**：所有 QLoRA 引用标注 "(6-gen subset)"；补报 8-gen LOGO 下 QLoRA 结果。
86	
87	**W4** [Major | R1 提出, R2 同意] **Bootstrap CI 未捕获 generator-level 方差**
88	- 8-gen LOGO macro F1=0.762，95% CI 宽度仅 4.8pp。但 per-generator binary F1 range 达 9.1pp (0.633-0.724)。Pythia 系列系统性高于其他 family，可能反映 Pythia-410M 参考模型的 same-family 优势。
89	- **修复方向**：补充 across-generator SD/IQR 与 bootstrap CI 并列报告；讨论 same-family reference bias。
90	
91	**W5** [Minor-Major | R1+R2+Visual Check 共识] **前 4 页无任何图表，信息密度不均**
92	- 作为 empirical paper，前 4 整页纯文字，首个视觉元素 (Table 1) 在 page 5，Figure 1 在 page 6。Related Work 1.5+ 页无结构化对比。
93	- **修复方向**：将 Figure 1 (strip plot) 前移至 Introduction 末尾或 Method 开头；Related Work 加入 method comparison table。
94	
95	**W6** [Minor | R1 提出, R2 部分同意] **五种 effect-size measures 的 "complementarity" 过度宣称**
96	- Cohen's d 和 Glass's Δ 在组间方差接近时高度相关；KS 在 location shift 主导时也与 Cohen's d 强相关。"五重验证" 可能过度膨胀置信度。
97	- **修复方向**：改为 "convergence across parametric and non-parametric measures"；补充 inter-measure 相关矩阵。
98	
99	**W7** [Minor | R1+R2 共识] **Reference model (Pythia-410M) same-family confound 主文讨论不足**
100	- 8 个 generator 中 2 个来自 Pythia family，reference model 同家族。Appendix S 验证了 cross-family reference 信号保持（spread 0.013），但主文仅一笔带过。
101	- **修复方向**：§3.3 或 §5 补充 reference model bias 讨论；分 generator 报告 cross-reference 影响。

105	## Reviewer Consensus [AGREE]
106	
107	1. **页数超限** (~8.5 页) 需立即修复——desk reject 风险
108	2. **tail_decay 应重分类**——4/8 TOST 通过率不支持 "near-stationary" 标签
109	3. **Base-model-only 限制**需在主文更显著讨论
110	4. **QLoRA +11.6pp 跨子集不一致**需标注子集信息
111	5. **Bootstrap CI + generator-level variance** 需补充报告
112	6. **Downstream null result** 需在 Discussion 获得更充分讨论
113	7. **前 4 页无图表**需改善信息密度分布
114	8. **Proof-of-concept 定位总体良好**，论文在大多数位置保持一致
115	9. **引用质量良好**（66 条, 0 orphan, 0 missing），建议补充 Tulchinskii et al. (2024)
116	
117	## Reviewer Divergence [REBUT]
118	
119	1. **DDR 新颖性** [核心分歧]
120	   - R1 (3.5): location/shape 分离是新贡献，在 model collapse 文献中未见——DDR ≠ diversity loss 的简单重述；即使需更强验证，decomposition 本身有独立价值
121	   - R2 (3.0): drifting features 本质是已知的 diversity loss，shape stability 可能是 nucleus sampling 的 trivial 推论，增量贡献有限
122	   - **两人共识**：无论如何，nucleus sampling confound 需要实验验证（greedy/top-k）
123	
124	2. **k=2 聚类严重性**
125	   - R1: critical（描述性非推断性，p=0.030 仅边际显著）
126	   - R2: major（generator-split/holdout/ε-stability 三重验证已相当充分）
127	
128	3. **ε=0.20 循环论证严重性**
129	   - R1: critical（缺乏 domain-specific justification）
130	   - R2: major（Table 30 证明核心分区对 ε 高度稳定，"循环论证" 判断过重）
131	
132	4. **3-class 粒度的价值**
133	   - R1: 科学价值独立于即时应用，证明 depth 可检测本身就是贡献
134	   - R2: 缺乏量化 use case，增量价值论证不足
135	
136	---
137	
138	## Questions
139	
140	1. Shape stability 是否在 greedy decoding / pure top-k 下同样成立？如果仅在 nucleus sampling 下成立，如何论证这不是 sampling truncation 的 trivial 推论？[R1+R2]
141	2. Downstream null result (Appendix M) 表明 depth-aware curation ≈ random subsampling。在什么条件下预期 depth signal 能转化为实际 downstream benefit？[R2]
142	3. 增加更多特征（n-gram diversity, 句法复杂度, discourse coherence）后 DDR 的 drifting/stationary 二分是否仍成立？当前 7 特征中 5 个基于 token-level NLL，特征空间局限性是否预设了分区结果？[R1]
143	4. Instruction-tuned 下 silhouette 降至 0.372——DDR 框架的 drifting/stationary 分离前提是否在 instruction-tuned 模型下不再成立？这是否意味着论文的理论贡献局限于 base models？[R1+R2]
144	5. 使用 2.8B/7B 参考模型是否会改变 DDR 分区本身（不仅是分类 F1）？Appendix S 未报告此项。[R1]
145	6. 是否尝试过从分类 F1 角度反推 ε（操作上可忽略的最小效应）？[R1]
146	7. 是否尝试过在 instruction-tuned chain 上重新训练分类器（而非 base-trained 分类器直接迁移）？[R2]

189	
190	**评分理由**：
191	
192	论文在实验执行和统计方法上高于平均水准，DDR 的 location/shape 分解角度有一定新意，问题定义从 binary 到 ordinal 是有意义的延伸。但以下因素将评分压至 Findings 水平：
193	
194	1. **格式违规** (N1): 主文约 8.5-8.7 页，超过 8 页限制，存在 desk reject 风险。这是可修复的但当前状态下是硬伤。
195	2. **核心新颖性存疑** (N2): shape stability 可能是 nucleus sampling 的 by-design 属性——论文未提供非 nucleus sampling 的验证实验，而 Discussion 原文恰恰暗示了这一机制解释。如果这一质疑成立，DDR 的 "novel observation" 将缩水为 "nucleus sampling + 已知 diversity loss"。R1 认为 location/shape 分离本身有独立贡献 (3.5)，R2 认为增量性更强 (3.0)——这是评分差异的核心来源。
196	3. **统计框架的方法论短板** (N3-N5): k=2 聚类在 n=7 上虽有辅助验证但统计效力先天不足；tail_decay "near-stationary" 标签不准确（4/8 TOST）；ε=0.20 缺乏 domain-specific justification。这些单独看是可修复的 major 问题，但累积起来削弱了 DDR 分析框架的 methodological rigor。
197	4. **实际影响力受限**: base-model-only scope + downstream null result + 3-class 粒度限制了论文的应用前景。
198	
199	**如果以下条件满足，评分可提升至 3.5 (Borderline Conference)**：
200	- 修复页数超限
201	- 补充 greedy/top-k 下 shape stability 验证（或令人信服地论证为何 nucleus-sampling-specific 仍有独立贡献）
202	- 修正 tail_decay 分类标签
203	- Discussion 充分讨论 instruct 退化和 downstream null result

207	## Detailed Comments
208	
209	### Section 1 (Introduction)
210	- 开头 "When LLM outputs re-enter generation pipelines" 暗示广泛适用性，但论文仅覆盖 base model continuation chains。建议第一段明确 scope。
211	- Contribution 列表从 3 条缩减到 2 条 + 一个 "additionally provide"——结构清晰但 "additionally" 部分读起来像第三个贡献。
212	- R2-Q5: 为什么选 continuation chain 而非 paraphrase chain？R1 引用 Appendix Z.6 Table 41 解释了方法论原因（语义自由度更高），但主文未讨论此设计选择。
213	
214	### Section 2 (Related Work)
215	- §2.2 最后一段对 Broken Telephone / Markovian Chains 的区分较好，但 R2 认为仍可加入结构化对比表以增强说服力。
216	- 缺 Tulchinskii et al. (2024) [R1+R2 共识]。
217	
218	### Section 3 (Method)
219	- §3.3 "entropy as shorthand for NLL" 声明存在但可考虑更精确的措辞（R2 minor）。
220	- §3.4 "LOGO family-level" 行定义需澄清——是 per-generator 还是 per-family leave-one-out（R1 minor）。
221	- Reference model 选择的潜在偏差应在此处或 §5 明确讨论。
222	
223	### Section 4 (Results)
224	- §4.1: bootstrap CI [0.758, 0.766] 宽度仅 0.8pp，而 per-generator spread 9.1pp。需补充 generator-level variance。
225	- §4.2: "five complementary effect-size measures" → 建议改为 "convergence across parametric and non-parametric measures"。
226	- §4.2: tail_decay 的 4/8 TOST 在主文已有三句覆盖 (L89-91)，但 "near-stationary" 标签仍过于宽泛。
227	- §4.3: Table 2 显示 4-det+surface (0.708) > 7-feature (0.705)——论文诚实报告，DDR 贡献定位为 decomposition 而非 classification performance。
228	
229	### Section 5 (Discussion)
230	- 篇幅过长（~1.3 页），是页数超限的主要原因。
231	- 14B preliminary results 可移至附录。
232	- Model collapse 区分的讨论虽重要但可精简。
233	- Downstream null result 仅一句话——需扩展。
234	- QLoRA "0.905" 引用未标注 6-gen subset。
235	
236	### Section 6 (Conclusion)
237	- "preliminary 14B evidence confirms the partition" 用词偏强——14B 是 preliminary 且仅 1 个模型。
238	- 可适当压缩。
239	
240	### R1 事实纠正
241	R1-W5 声称 "缺 t=1.0"，但 Table 10 (Appendix H) 明确测试了 t∈{0.5, 0.7, 1.0}。R2 在交叉回应中纠正了此事实错误。温度覆盖度限制在于仅 4/8 generator 参与温度实验，而非缺少特定温度点。

2]\nforce_resubmit: False\n---\n\n# Round 36 审稿报告 — Depth Fingerprinting: Detecting Recursive Generation Depth in LLM Text Chains\n\n**Venue**: EMNLP 2026 (ARR) | **Deadline**: 2026-05-25 | **审稿模式**: Fresh (初审)\n**Reviewer 编排**: R1 (方法严谨性) + R2 (新颖性/完整性) | **轮次**: 1 轮 + 交叉回应\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\n论文提出 \"depth fingerprinting\"：将 AI 文本检测从二分类扩展到序数深度估计（gen-0/gen-1/gen-2+），核心发现为 differential depth response (DDR)——在 8 个 base-model generator（5 个架构家族, 0.6B-8B）的递归生成链中，NLL 位置统计量单调漂移而分布形状特征保持稳定。基于 DDR 的 7 特征 ensemble 在 leave-one-generator-out 评估下达到 binary F1=0.694；端到端 QLoRA 分类器达到 0.905。\n\n---\n\n## Strengths\n\n1. **新颖的问题定义** [R1+R2 共识]：从 binary detection 到 ordinal depth classification 是自然且有意义的延伸，在 data provenance 和 model collapse 预防中有清晰的应用场景。\n2. **DDR 分解有洞察力** [R1+R2 共识]：location/shape 分离——drifting features 单调漂移而 shape features 近似不变——是一个有趣的实证发现，为理解 LLM 递归生成的分布演化提供了新视角。\n3. **实验覆盖面极广且预判到位** [R1+R2 共识]：17+ 项补充实验（TOST、LOFO、cross-domain、temperature、prompt type、instruction tuning、QLoRA、Granger causality、transfer、perturbation robustness 等），24 页附录系统性回答了大部分可预见质疑。\n4. **泄露控制设计严谨** [R1]：三重机制——leak-free binary F1、seed-level demeaning (F1=0.701)、independent-seed control (F1=0.680)——差距仅 1.4pp，令人信服。\n5. **诚实的 proof-of-concept 定位** [R2]：论文没有过度宣传分类性能，明确承认 ~30% 错分率和范围限制。\n6. **与 baseline 的公平对比** [R1+R2 共识]：Table 2 使用相同 XGBoost pipeline 和 LOGO 协议，方法论公平。\n7. **引用规范** [R2]：66 条引用，0 orphan，0 phantom，覆盖 2019-2026 文献。\n\n---\n\n## Weaknesses\n\n### Must-Fix（影响接收决定）\n\n**N1** [Critical | R1+R2+Visual Check 三方共识] **主文页数超过 EMNLP 8 页限制**\n- Discussion 跨 page 8-9（约 1.3 页），Conclusion 在 page 9 约 20%，主文合计约 8.5-8.7 页。\n- EMNLP 2026 严格限制主文 8 页（Limitations/Ethics 不计入）。格式违规可导致 desk reject。\n- **修复方向**：压缩 Discussion 至 ~0.8 页（model collapse 区分、14B 初步结果、温度重复论述可移至附录）。\n\n**N2** [Critical | R2 提出, R1 部分同意] **DDR 核心新颖性的 nucleus sampling confound**\n- DDR 的 shape stability（entropy_max, tail_decay 稳定）可能是 nucleus sampling 在固定 p=0.9 下截断的 by-design 结果。Discussion (p.8) 原文 \"top-p truncation selects from a fixed probability mass fraction...preserving the functional form\" 恰恰暗示这是采样机制的数学性质。\n- 论文**仅在 nucleus sampling 框架内**变化温度，未测试 greedy decoding、pure top-k、beam search。如果 shape stability 在非 nucleus sampling 下不成立，DDR 框架的泛化性和新颖性将显著缩水——变成 \"nucleus sampling 的已知属性 + 已知的 diversity loss\"。\n- **R1 交叉回应中的关键判断**：\"问题不仅是温度范围窄，而是整个 decoding paradigm 的覆盖缺失\"，建议升级为 must-fix 级补充实验。\n- **R2 的核心论点**：drifting features（entropy_mean↓, TTR↓, hapax↓）本质上是 model collapse 文献中已记录的 diversity loss / entropy erosion；论文声称的新颖性在于 \"what is preserved\"，但如果 preservation 是采样机制的固有属性，增量贡献有限。\n- **R1 的部分反驳**：location/shape 分离作为 decomposition 在 model collapse 文献中未被报告，且正是有 stable reference 才使 cross-generator depth detection 成为可能——DDR ≠ diversity loss 的简单重述。\n- **分歧状态**：R1 认为 location/shape 分离有独立贡献但同意需要实验验证；R2 认为增量性更强。两人均同意 nucleus sampling confound 需要至少 greedy + top-k 验证实验。\n- **修复方向**：(1) 补充 greedy/top-k 下 shape stability 验证；(2) 或明确承认 nucleus-sampling-specific 并精准界定增量贡献。\n\n**N3** [Critical→Major, R1 提出, R2 降级] **k=2 聚类在 n=7 特征点上统计效力不足**\n- DDR 分区依赖 k-means 在 7 个数据点上的聚类（silhouette=0.660），本质上是描述性的而非推断性的。排列检验 p=0.030 仅边际显著。\n- **缓解证据**（R2 指出，R1 同意其存在但认为不充分）：generator-split validation 两组独立产生完全相同分区；holdout split 中 zone assignment 完全一致；跨 ε 稳定性在 [0.10, 0.75] 内核心分区不变。\n- **严重性分歧**：R1 维持 critical（描述性非推断性），R2 降级为 major（三重验证已相当充分）。\n- **综合判断**：降为 **Major**——现有 validation 支撑 descriptive claim，但 inferential rigor 有提升空间。\n- **修复方向**：补充 gap statistic 或 prediction strength；考虑 sample-level bootstrap 验证聚类稳定性。\n\n**N4** [Critical→Major, R1 提出, R2 同意] **TOST 中 tail_decay 仅 4/8 generator 通过——\"near-stationary\" 名不副实**\n- tail_decay 在 ε=0.20 下仅 4/8 generator 通过 TOST；非通过 generators |d|=0.15-0.22。Granger causality p=0.375，permutation importance rank 7/7（最低）——均指向 \"noisy/inconsistent\" 而非 \"near-stationary\"。\n- R1 和 R2 均同意应重分类。DDR 三分区（3/1/3）中 near-stationary 组有 1/3 不稳定，削弱框架清晰度。\n- **修复方向**：主文将 tail_decay 重分类为 \"weakly stationary\"；补充移除 tail_decay 后的分类和分区 sensitivity analysis；Figure 2 中用不同标记区分。\n\n**N5** [Critical→Major, R1 提出, R2 部分反驳] **ε=0.20 等价阈值缺乏问题特定正当性**\n- Cohen's d=0.20 是行为科学通用惯例，未论证在生成深度检测中的合理性。\n- **R2 反驳要点**：Table 30 证明核心分区在 ε∈[0.10, 0.75] 内完全不变——\"分区结果是阈值函数\" 仅适用于 entropy_std 的归属，不适用于核心 drifting/stationary 分区。\n- **综合判断**：降为 **Major**——核心分区对 ε 高度稳定，但补充 task-specific justification 会增强论证。\n- **修复方向**：从分类 F1 角度反推 SESOI（操作上可忽略的最小效应）；或绘制 equivalence frontier 图。\n\n### Should-Fix（影响评分但不一票否决）\n\n**W1** [Major | R1+R2 共识] **Base-model-only 范围限制实际适用性**\n- Appendix K 显示 instruction-tuned models 3-class F1 降至 0.575/0.544（降幅 17-21pp），DDR silhouette 从 0.660 降至 0.372。2025-2026 年绝大多数部署 LLM 都是 instruction-tuned。\n- Abstract/Introduction 措辞 (\"When LLM outputs re-enter generation pipelines\") 暗示广泛适用性，与 base-model-only 范围存在张力。\n- **修复方向**：Discussion 增加专门段落讨论 instruct 退化机制；Introduction 第一段明确 scope。\n\n**W2** [Major

**修复方向**：Discussion 增加专门段落讨论 null result 含义、为什么 depth signal 不能转化下游收益、在什么条件下可能有差异；重新定位价值为 provenance/audit 而非 curation。\n\n**W3** [Major | R1 提出, R2 同意] **QLoRA +11.6pp 基线比较跨子集不一致**\n- +11.6pp 基于

(2024)\n\n## Reviewer Divergence [REBUT]\n\n1. **DDR 新颖性** [核心分歧]\n   - R1 (3.5): location/shape 分离是新贡献，在 model collapse 文献中未见——DDR ≠ diversity loss 的简单重述；即使需更强验证，decomposition 本身有独立价值\n   - R2 (3.0): drifting features 本质是已知的 diversity loss，shape stability 可能是 nucleus sampling 的 trivial 推论，增量贡献有限\n   - **两人共识**：无论如何，nucleus sampling confound 需要实验验证（greedy/top-k）\n\n2. **k=2 聚类严重性**\n   - R1: critical（描述性非推断性，p=0.030 仅边际显著）\n   - R2: major（generator-split/holdout/ε-stability 三重验证已相当充分）\n\n3. **ε=0.20 循环论证严重性**\n   - R1: critical（缺乏 domain-specific justification）\n   - R2: major（Table 30 证明核心分区对 ε 高度稳定，\"循环论证\" 判断过重）\n\n4. **3-class 粒度的价值**\n   - R1: 科学价值独立于即时应用，证明 depth 可检测本身就是贡献\n   - R2: 缺乏量化 use case，增量价值论证不足\n\n---\n\n## Questions\n\n1. Shape stability 是否在 greedy decoding / pure top-k 下同样成立？如果仅在 nucleus sampling 下成立，如何论证这不是 sampling truncation 的 trivial 推论？[R1+R2]\n2. Downstream null result (Appendix M) 表明 depth-aware curation ≈ random subsampling。在什么条件下预期 depth signal 能转化为实际 downstream benefit？[R2]\n3. 增加更多特征（n-gram diversity, 句法复杂度, discourse coherence）后 DDR 的 drifting/stationary 二分是否仍成立？当前 7 特征中 5 个基于 token-level NLL，特征空间局限性是否预设了分区结果？[R1]\n4. Instruction-tuned 下 silhouette 降至 0.372——DDR 框架的 drifting/stationary 分离前提是否在 instruction-tuned 模型下不再成立？这是否意味着论文的理论贡献局限于 base models？[R1+R2]\n5. 使用 2.8B/7B 参考模型是否会改变 DDR 分区本身（不仅是分类 F1）？Appendix S 未报告此项。[R1]\n6. 是否尝试过从分类 F1 角度反推 ε（操作上可忽略的最小效应）？[R1]\n7. 是否尝试过在 instruction-tuned chain 上重新训练分类器（而非 base-trained 分类器直接迁移）？[R2]\n\n---\n\n## Missing References\n\n以下由两位 Reviewer 独立建议：\n1. **Tulchinskii et al.

```text
Now I have a comprehensive understanding of the Round 36 review. The user wants to focus on writing improvements to optimize the empirical analysis sections. Let me think about what writing improvements could push the score from 3.0 toward 3.5.

Key areas for writing improvement (no new experiments):

1. **N2 — Strengthen DDR novelty argument** (already partially done):
   - I already added the nucleus sampling acknowledgment + τ=1.0 evidence
   - Could further strengthen the argument that location/shape decomposition is novel even if shape stability is sampling-related
   - Add explicit articulation that DDR's value is the *decomposition framework* enabling cross-generator detection, not the shape stability mechanism
   
2. **N3/N5 — Strengthen statistical framework description**: I should leverage the exhaustive enumeration results (rank 1/35) as additional validation evidence and frame the k=2 clustering decision as supported by multiple independent approaches rather than just one.

3. **W5 — Front-loading visual elements**: Moving Figure 1 or a framework diagram to pages 2-3 could significantly improve the reviewer's first impression, though I need to verify this fits within the 8-page constraint.

4. **Overall framing — "empirically validated analytical framework"**: The paper should emphasize this positioning throughout to strengthen the narrative around rigorous validation.

5. **DDR novelty and impact**: I need to be more assertive that DDR provides actionable decomposition beyond description—highlighting the task formulation novelty, how decomposition enables cross-generator prediction, and how structural insights complement model collapse findings.

6. **Discussion and Introduction refinement**: Sharpening the contribution framing in the Introduction and restructuring the Discussion to better articulate the model collapse contrast while strengthening the "what is preserved" narrative.

The highest-impact edits would be moving a figure earlier for better reader engagement, strengthening the DDR novelty framing in both Introduction and Discussion, and polishing the empirical analysis narrative in Results section 4.2.

The key remaining challenge is making a compelling case that DDR's contribution stands independently—that identifying which distributional properties carry depth signal is empirically novel regardless of whether shape stability is nucleus-sampling-specific, and that this decomposition has independent value beyond the mechanism question.

Now I'm mapping out the current page layout to see where I can move figures earlier for better reader experience, particularly Figure 2 or Figure 1, since moving visual results forward would strengthen the paper's impact.

The challenge is that LaTeX float placement is constrained — forcing figures earlier risks them appearing before their textual references, which breaks the reading flow. I could create a conceptual diagram in the Introduction to preview the location/shape decomposition idea, but that's labor-intensive. Alternatively, I should check if there's a method figure I could advance, though the core issue is that pages 1-4 currently have no visual elements at all, which is unusual for an empirical paper and likely what the reviewer flagged.

Given the four-day deadline, I need to prioritize strategically: strengthening the DDR novelty argument will have the most impact on the score, then addressing figure placement if it's feasible, and finally polishing the writing. Let me focus on rereading the empirical analysis sections to see where the writing can be sharpened and the analysis made more compelling. I'm mapping out the specific revisions needed across the paper. The Introduction needs stronger language around DDR's predictive power, the Results section requires a more compelling transition into the decomposition analysis, and the Discussion is where I should emphasize that the framework itself—not just the empirical findings—constitutes the core contribution. I should also check whether moving an early figure would help with the layout constraints.

```text
1	\section{Method}
2	\label{sec:method}
3	
4	\subsection{Task Formulation}
5	\label{sec:task}
6	
7	Given a text $x$, we predict its \emph{generation depth} $d \in \{0, 1, 2{+}\}$: human-written ($d{=}0$), first-generation LLM output ($d{=}1$), or text produced by two or more recursive LLM generations ($d{=}2{+}$).
8	A generation chain of depth $k$ is defined recursively: $x^{(0)} \sim \mathcal{C}_0$ (human corpus), $x^{(k)} = G(x^{(k-1)})$ for $k \geq 1$, where $G$ denotes stochastic autoregressive generation.
9	Depths beyond 2 are merged into $2{+}$ because feature convergence compresses inter-class margins at deeper levels (\S\ref{sec:results-differential}).
10	
11	\subsection{Generation Chain Construction}
12	\label{sec:generation}
13	
14	We construct generation chains using eight generators spanning five model families: \textbf{Pythia} (2.8B, 1B) \cite{pythia}, \textbf{OLMo} (OLMo-2-1B) \cite{olmo}, \textbf{Qwen} (Qwen3-1.7B, Qwen3-0.6B, Qwen3-8B-Base) \cite{qwen3}, \textbf{Llama} (Llama-3.2-3B) \cite{llama3}, and \textbf{Mistral} (Mistral-7B-v0.3) \cite{mistral7b}.
15	This selection spans parameter scales from 0.6B to 8B and diverse pretraining corpora, enabling evaluation of cross-generator and cross-scale generalization.
16	
17	For each generator, we sample approximately 1{,}000 seed passages from English Wikipedia as $\mathcal{C}_0$.
18	The same pool of seed passages serves as gen-0 for all generators.
19	We use shared seeds across generators so that cross-generator comparisons control for input content and isolate the effect of the generation model from source text variation.
20	In LOGO evaluation, gen-0 samples from the held-out generator's chains also appear (with the same text) in the training generators' chains, creating a potential train--test overlap for the gen-0 class.
21	We address this with a supplementary binary evaluation excluding gen-0 entirely (\S\ref{sec:results-baselines}).
22	Each seed is iteratively fed through the generator to produce a chain of depth 4 (i.e., gen-0 through gen-4), using the prompt ``\texttt{Continue the following text: \{text\}}''.
23	We generate up to depth~4 to empirically confirm convergence: 5-class analysis shows adjacent depths 2--4 become indistinguishable (F1\,$\approx$\,0.27; Appendix~\ref{app:finer-depth}), motivating the gen-2+ class collapse.
24	All generation uses temperature $\tau{=}0.7$, nucleus sampling with $p{=}0.9$, and maximum length of 256 new tokens.
25	After filtering chain breaks and passages too short for feature extraction, 37{,}058 texts remain across all depths (Appendix~\ref{app:dataset-stats}); depths 2--4 are collapsed into $2{+}$.
26	
27	\subsection{Feature Extraction}
28	\label{sec:features}
29	
30	The seven features operationalize two complementary views of distributional drift: reference-model features capture how the token-level NLL distribution shifts relative to a fixed model (location and shape statistics), while surface features capture how lexical diversity contracts under recursive generation (type-token statistics).
31	This dual-view design enables the location/shape decomposition that constitutes our primary finding.
32	We deliberately use interpretable distributional statistics so that the DDR partition remains transparent and mechanistically informative; end-to-end neural features improve classification ($+$11.6\,pp; Appendix~\ref{app:qlora}) but obscure the decomposition.
33	Cross-group ablation (\S\ref{sec:results-differential}) and leave-one-feature-out analysis (Appendix~\ref{app:lofo}) confirm that both feature groups contribute independently.
34	
35	We extract seven distributional features per text, organized into two groups based on what they measure rather than how they are computed.
36	
37	\paragraph{Reference-model features.}
38	A held-out reference model (Pythia-410M, chosen to be smaller than all generators) computes per-token negative log-likelihood (NLL) for each text.
39	We use ``entropy'' as shorthand for token-level NLL throughout, following convention in prior detection work; these are point-wise NLL values, not Shannon entropy of the full distribution.
40	Although Pythia-410M shares the GPT-NeoX architecture with two of the eight generators, cross-family reference model experiments (\S\ref{sec:results-differential}) confirm that depth features are not reference-specific (LOGO F1 varies by $\leq$0.013 across Pythia, OLMo, and Qwen references).
41	From the resulting NLL sequence, we extract five statistics:
42	\begin{itemize}[nosep,leftmargin=*]
43	    \item \textbf{entropy\_mean}: mean token-level NLL, which captures the average predictability of the text under the reference model;
44	    \item \textbf{entropy\_std}: standard deviation of token-level NLL, which measures the spread of per-token surprise;
45	    \item \textbf{entropy\_max}: maximum token-level NLL, which captures the most surprising token;
46	    \item \textbf{entropy\_min}: minimum token-level NLL, capturing the reference model's confidence floor on the most predictable token;
47	    \item \textbf{tail\_decay}: slope of the vocabulary-level averaged log-probability distribution in the mid-rank region (ranks 100--1000), capturing how steeply probability mass decays beyond high-frequency tokens.
48	\end{itemize}
49	
50	\paragraph{Surface features.}
51	Two features capture lexical diversity without requiring a reference model:
52	\begin{itemize}[nosep,leftmargin=*]
53	    \item \textbf{TTR}: type-token ratio (number of unique word types divided by total tokens);
54	    \item \textbf{hapax\_ratio}: proportion of words appearing exactly once (\emph{hapax legomena}).
55	\end{itemize}
56	
57	\paragraph{Feature complementarity.}
58	These features exhibit a \emph{differential depth response} (DDR), separating into drifting and non-drifting groups (\S\ref{sec:results-differential}; pairwise correlations in Appendix~\ref{sec:appendix-feature-correlation}).
59	TTR and hapax ratio are strongly correlated ($r = 0.97$); both are retained for marginal LOFO gains.
60	
61	\subsection{Evaluation Protocol}
62	\label{sec:evaluation}
63	
64	\paragraph{Cross-validation.}
65	To evaluate generalization, we use \textbf{Leave-One-Generator-Out (LOGO)} cross-validation over all eight generators.
66	LOGO holds out individual generators but does not isolate family effects; \textbf{Leave-One-Family-Out (LOFO)} addresses this by holding out entire model families (binary F1\,=\,0.686; \S\ref{sec:results-classification}).
67	Generator subsets vary across experiments (Appendix~\ref{app:gen-subsets-section}).
68	
69	\paragraph{Classifier.}
70	We use XGBoost \cite{xgboost} throughout ($n\_\text{estimators}{=}200$, $\max\_\text{depth}{=}6$, learning rate $0.1$), with identical hyperparameters across all methods in Table~\ref{tab:baselines}.
71	Alternative classifiers (CORAL \cite{coral_ordinal}, CORN \cite{corn_ordinal}, Frank-Hall \cite{frank_hall_ordinal}) yield comparable performance (Appendix~\ref{app:classifier}); discriminative power resides in the features, not the classifier.
72	
73	\paragraph{Metrics and statistical testing.}
74	The primary metric is \textbf{macro-averaged F1} over the three depth classes, with 95\% bootstrap CIs ($n{=}1{,}000$).
75	All $p$-values are two-sided with Bonferroni correction within each family of simultaneous tests.
76	
77	\paragraph{Baselines.}
78	We compare the 7-feature ensemble against four single-score detection methods repurposed as depth predictors: Avg-LogProb, FastDetectGPT \cite{fast_detectgpt}, Binoculars \cite{binoculars}, and LD-Score \cite{ld_score}.
79	Each baseline score is used as a univariate feature in the same XGBoost framework under LOGO cross-validation to ensure a controlled comparison.
80	
81	\paragraph{Length confound control.}
82	Since TTR and hapax\_ratio are mechanically length-dependent, we verify depth signal is not a length artifact via length-matched subsampling that equalizes length distributions across depth classes (\S\ref{sec:results-classification}; Appendix~\ref{app:length}).

Appendix~\\ref{app:finer-depth}), motivating the gen-2+ class collapse.\nAll generation uses temperature $\\tau{=}0.7$, nucleus sampling with $p{=}0.9$, and maximum length of 256 new tokens.\nAfter filtering chain breaks and passages too short for feature extraction, 37{,}058 texts remain across all depths (Appendix~\\ref{app:dataset-stats}); depths 2--4 are collapsed into $2{+}$.\n\n\\subsection{Feature Extraction}\n\\label{sec:features}\n\nThe seven features operationalize two complementary views of distributional drift: reference-model features capture how the token-level NLL distribution shifts relative to a fixed model (location and shape statistics), while surface features capture how lexical diversity contracts under recursive generation (type-token statistics).\nThis dual-view design enables the location/shape decomposition that constitutes our primary finding.\nWe deliberately use interpretable distributional statistics so that the DDR partition remains transparent and mechanistically informative;

```text
OK, I now have a comprehensive view of the paper. Let me think strategically about what writing improvements will have the most impact on pushing from 3.0 to 3.5.

The key bottleneck according to the review is N2 (DDR novelty). The reviewer's core concern is:
- Drifting features = already known diversity loss
- Shape stability = possibly trivial property of nucleus sampling
- So DDR = known phenomenon + trivial property = limited novelty

The counter-argument (which R1 partially made) is:
- Location/shape decomposition is novel — not reported in model collapse literature


- This decomposition enables cross-generator prediction without calibration
- Identifying which features are stable versus drifting is itself a new contribution, even if shape stability stems from the sampling method
- The stable reference features are what unlock cross-generator detection

Without running new experiments, I need to strengthen this argument through writing alone. The key places to tighten are the introduction—explicitly framing this as the first systematic decomposition of inference-chain drift into location and shape components—the opening of results section 4.2 to clarify why DDR matters beyond just describing the phenomenon, and the discussion to better articulate that the decomposition has independent value regardless of whether shape stability is sampling-specific.

For the method section, I could motivate the dual-view design more strongly. On the structural side, I'm considering whether to move figures earlier to address the W5 feedback. The current layout keeps all text on pages 1-4 before Table 1 appears on page 5 and Figure 1 on page 6, which creates a forward-reference problem since these are discussed in the results. One option is to add a conceptual overview element in the method section that could pull a key figure forward without disrupting the logical flow.

I'm thinking about adding a small table in the method section that maps the seven features to their DDR categories—this would serve as an early visual anchor and help clarify the feature design. The challenge is that DDR hasn't been formally defined yet at that point in the paper, so it might feel premature. Another approach would be to create a pipeline figure at the start of the method section, or leverage the existing foreshadowing in line 31 where the dual-view design is already mentioned as enabling the location/shape decomposition. Rather than creating entirely new figures, I should focus on what I can accomplish through writing improvements. My plan is to strengthen the introduction first. I'm narrowing down to the most impactful edits that won't bloat the paper. I should strengthen how DDR's novelty is framed in the introduction—specifically emphasizing that it identifies what's preserved rather than just what drifts. Then I'll add a sentence or two to the discussion reinforcing that DDR's value stands independently of whatever mechanism causes the drift. Finally, I'll polish the results section for clarity without adding length. The related work table is tempting but risky given page constraints, so I'm setting that aside for now. I'm refining the empirical decomposition section to highlight that DDR reveals what persists across generators—specifically, that location features drive depth detection while shape features remain stable as cross-generator invariants. Now I'm working through the Discussion edits, tightening the causal narrative around nucleus sampling's effects and clarifying where the classifier succeeds as a proof-of-concept for depth-aware filtering, though the mechanism still primarily compresses surface statistics rather than deeper structural properties.

I want to add a sentence that directly counters the concern that DDR is just "nucleus sampling plus known diversity loss" by emphasizing the contribution is the decomposition framework itself—identifying which features carry the cross-generator depth signal—regardless of whether shape stability comes from truncation mechanics or autoregressive properties. Then I'll move to tightening the Method section.

The feature description in lines 30-32 is already solid—it clearly explains how the dual-view design (reference-model features for distributional shift, surface features for lexical contraction) enables the location/shape decomposition. I'll keep that as is.

Now I'm thinking about whether a compact feature summary table could work better than the bullet points in §3.3, giving readers an early visual reference for what features are being used.

But actually, I should focus on the highest-impact edits first: adding an "independent of mechanism" argument to the Discussion, tightening the contribution statement in the Introduction, and sharpening the narrative opening in Results §4.2. These are surgical changes that will strengthen the paper without requiring major restructuring.

For the Discussion, I want to emphasize that the decomposition itself—identifying which distributional properties signal depth across generators—is the core contribution, regardless of whether shape stability comes from sampling truncation or deeper autoregressive properties. And in the Introduction, I can sharpen the contrast between what prior work documents (convergence) versus what DDR identifies (preservation), making the novelty more immediate.

Looking back at the abstract, it already frames this as "shape invariance provides the stable reference needed for depth estimation without per-generator calibration," so the Introduction should echo that language for consistency. Let me check what the current Introduction text actually says and align it properly. }, DDR identifies \emph{what is preserved}---enabling depth detection without per-generator calibration."

I could strengthen this by adding citations and the "stable reference" concept from the abstract: "Where prior work documents \emph{what converges} \cite{curious_decline,markovian_chains}, DDR identifies \emph{what is preserved}---shape invariance provides the stable reference needed for depth detection without per-generator calibration." This grounds it in the literature while keeping the core insight sharp.

For the revision strategy, I should focus on three concrete changes: adding the "independent of mechanism" framing to the Discussion, citing the convergence literature in the Introduction, and ensuring §4.2 clearly states that DDR's value is identifying which distributional properties drift rather than solving classification itself.

The reviewer also flagged the lack of visuals in the first four pages, so I'm drafting a feature summary table for §3.3 that would list the reference and surface features with their measurements---this would break up the dense text and give readers a quick reference anchor.

Generating markdown table... I'm weighing whether replacing the bullet points with a compact table would save space overall, since the table could condense the feature descriptions while adding visual clarity. Rather than restructure everything now, I'll focus on the more straightforward edits first and revisit the table approach if there's time.

Let me analyze what writing improvements would most impact the score. The key bottleneck is N2 (DDR novelty perceived as limited) — without experiments, the writing must make a stronger case for DDR's independent analytical value.

1	\section{Introduction}
2	\label{sec:introduction}
3	
4	AI text detection asks a single binary question---\emph{human or machine?}---and recent methods answer it with increasing reliability \cite{detectgpt,fast_detectgpt,binoculars,ld_score}.
5	Yet this framing elides a richer structure emerging on the open web: as LLM outputs re-enter training corpora \cite{dolma,fineweb} and seed further generation, text accumulates at varying \emph{recursive depths}---an estimated 7--17\% of recent scientific publications already contain substantial LLM-modified content \cite{mapping_llm_science,monitoring_ai_review}---and each generation cycle pushes distributional properties further from both the human source and the first-generation predecessor.
6	While most deployed LLM outputs use instruction-tuned models, base-model generation pipelines remain prevalent in synthetic data production, pre-training corpus construction, and recursive data augmentation; we accordingly scope this study to base (pretrained) models.
7	Knowing \emph{how many times} text has been recursively generated matters for data provenance \cite{ccnet,dsir} and model collapse analysis \cite{curse_of_recursion,strong_model_collapse}, yet no current method moves beyond the binary boundary.
8	
9	We introduce \emph{depth fingerprinting}: classifying text by ordinal generation depth (gen-0\,/\,gen-1\,/\,gen-2+) and decomposing the distributional drift that accumulates across depths into structurally distinct components.
10	The core empirical finding is a \emph{differential depth response} (DDR): across eight base-model generators spanning five architectural families (0.6B--8B), the NLL distribution's central tendency (mean entropy, lexical diversity) drifts monotonically with depth while its shape (entropy extremes, tail structure) remains an order of magnitude more stable ($d{=}0.76$--$1.17$ vs.\ $d < 0.10$; convergence across parametric and non-parametric effect-size measures confirms this partition).
11	This location/shape asymmetry exposes a structural property of fixed-parameter autoregressive sampling: the decoding mechanism systematically compresses where the output distribution sits while preserving its higher-order form---a pattern mechanistically distinct from the tail-coverage erosion in model collapse \cite{curse_of_recursion}, and analytically informative independent of classification accuracy.
12	Concurrent work characterizes convergence in paraphrastic and translation chains \cite{broken_telephone,markovian_chains}; ours is the first to decompose the drift into complementary location and shape components and to leverage this asymmetry for cross-generator depth prediction.
13	We restrict to base (pretrained) models to isolate the generation dynamics from alignment artifacts (\S\ref{sec:discussion}).
14	
15	As a proof of concept, a lightweight 7-feature ensemble informed by DDR achieves leak-free binary F1\,=\,0.694 under leave-one-generator-out evaluation, surpassing individual detection baselines by 6.7--36.3\,pp; an end-to-end QLoRA classifier reaches 0.905 (6-gen LOGO; Appendix~\ref{app:qlora}), confirming that the depth signal extends well beyond handcrafted features.
16	
17	Our contributions:
18	\begin{enumerate}[nosep,leftmargin=*]
19	    \item \textbf{Empirical decomposition (DDR).} Clustering-based validation ($k{=}2$, silhouette\,=\,0.660) confirms that inference-chain drift separates into a drifting location component ($d{=}0.76$--$1.17$) and a stable shape component ($d < 0.10$). Where prior work documents \emph{what converges}, DDR identifies \emph{what is preserved}---enabling depth detection without per-generator calibration.
20	    \item \textbf{Task formulation and evaluation suite.} We define generation depth classification as an ordinal prediction task and construct a controlled dataset of 37K texts from eight generators across five families (0.6B--8B), with leave-one-generator-out cross-validation as the primary evaluation protocol.
21	\end{enumerate}
22	We additionally provide a proof-of-concept classifier (binary F1\,=\,0.694) and systematically map its operating boundaries across temperature, prompt type, instruction tuning, and model scale, establishing where DDR-based detection succeeds and where it fails.

1	\section{Discussion}
2	\label{sec:discussion}
3	
4	Recursive generation alters \emph{where} the token-level surprise distribution sits but not \emph{how} it is shaped---a dichotomy with a mechanistic basis.
5	Under nucleus sampling, top-$p$ truncation preserves the functional form of the conditional distribution at each step; what changes is the \emph{input}: as the model conditions on increasingly self-typical outputs, expected NLL compresses monotonically.
6	This yields two testable predictions: (1)~increasing sampling randomness should weaken the location drift, and (2)~semantic-preservation constraints should attenuate it.
7	Both are confirmed: at $t{=}1.0$, location signal collapses ($\rho$: $-0.60 \to -0.002$; Appendix~\ref{app:sampling-sensitivity}); under elaboration prompts, drift weakens (F1\,=\,0.730 vs.\ 0.781; Appendix~\ref{app:prompt-type}).
8	Causal analyses corroborate: drifting features contribute $5.5\times$ more to classification, with 6/7 exhibiting significant Granger causality (Appendix~\ref{app:ddr-causality}).
9	These results are established under nucleus sampling ($p{=}0.95$); at $\tau{=}1.0$---where truncation is near-minimal---shape features remain stable ($d < 0.15$; Appendix~\ref{app:ddr-temp-stability}), but verification under non-autoregressive decoding strategies remains open.
10	
11	The classifier is a proof-of-concept for corpus-level auditing, not per-document filtering: gen-1 per-class F1\,=\,0.63 is insufficient for individual flagging but supports batch-level contamination estimation (${\pm}3$--$4$\% at $n{=}1{,}000$; Appendix~\ref{app:error-analysis}).
12	Depth-aware filtering can serve as a prophylactic against model collapse \cite{drayson_detection_prevents_collapse}, though depth-stratified curation does not yet improve downstream training (TOST equivalence at $\varepsilon{=}{\pm}2\%$; Appendix~\ref{app:downstream})---consistent with depth primarily compressing surface statistics rather than the semantic content driving task performance.
13	The primary value thus lies in data provenance---determining recursive rewriting depth---rather than training improvement.
14	
15	DDR is mechanistically distinct from model collapse \cite{curse_of_recursion,strong_model_collapse}: retraining erodes tail coverage by updating weights, whereas inference-chain drift at fixed parameters shifts only location, leaving shape stable.
16	Vocabulary impoverishment alone cannot explain this asymmetry: if depth simplified the lexicon, shape features should also compress, yet they remain stable ($d < 0.10$; \S\ref{sec:results-differential}).
17	Prior work documents \emph{what converges}---diversity loss \cite{curious_decline}, attractor dynamics \cite{markovian_chains}---but not what is \emph{preserved}; this complementary observation enables depth detection without per-generator calibration.
18	Three depth classes represent the practical resolution ceiling (5-class F1\,$\approx$\,0.50; Appendix~\ref{app:finer-depth}); QLoRA recovers more signal (F1\,=\,0.905, 6-gen LOGO; Appendix~\ref{app:qlora}), reflecting token-order patterns that aggregate statistics miss.
19	Instruction-tuned models show compressed fingerprints (DDR silhouette 0.660$\to$0.372; Appendix~\ref{app:instruct}), though QLoRA recovers to 0.89--0.91, suggesting depth signal persists at the token-sequence level beyond DDR's feature decomposition.

    "originalFile": "\\section{Method}\n\\label{sec:method}\n\n\\subsection{Task Formulation}\n\\label{sec:task}\n\nGiven a text $x$, we predict its \\emph{generation depth} $d \\in \\{0, 1, 2{+}\\}$: human-written ($d{=}0$), first-generation LLM output ($d{=}1$), or text produced by two or more recursive LLM generations ($d{=}2{+}$).\nA generation chain of depth $k$ is defined recursively: $x^{(0)} \\sim \\mathcal{C}_0$ (human corpus), $x^{(k)} = G(x^{(k-1)})$ for $k \\geq 1$, where $G$ denotes stochastic autoregressive generation.\nDepths beyond 2 are merged into $2{+}$ because feature convergence compresses inter-class margins at deeper levels (\\S\\ref{sec:results-differential}).\n\n\\subsection{Generation Chain Construction}\n\\label{sec:generation}\n\nWe construct generation chains using eight generators spanning five model families: \\textbf{Pythia} (2.8B, 1B) \\cite{pythia}, \\textbf{OLMo} (OLMo-2-1B) \\cite{olmo}, \\textbf{Qwen} (Qwen3-1.7B, Qwen3-0.6B, Qwen3-8B-Base) \\cite{qwen3}, \\textbf{Llama} (Llama-3.2-3B) \\cite{llama3}, and \\textbf{Mistral} (Mistral-7B-v0.3) \\cite{mistral7b}.\nThis selection spans parameter scales from 0.6B to 8B and diverse pretraining corpora, enabling evaluation of cross-generator and cross-scale generalization.\n\nFor each generator, we sample approximately 1{,}000 seed passages from English Wikipedia as $\\mathcal{C}_0$.\nThe same pool of seed passages serves as gen-0 for all generators.\nWe use shared seeds across generators so that cross-generator comparisons control for input content and isolate the effect of the generation model from source text variation.\nIn LOGO evaluation, gen-0 samples from the held-out generator's chains also appear (with the same text) in the training generators' chains, creating a potential train--test overlap for the gen-0 class.\nWe address this with a supplementary binary evaluation excluding gen-0 entirely (\\S\\ref{sec:results-baselines}).\nEach seed is iteratively fed through the generator to produce a chain of depth 4 (i.e., gen-0 through gen-4), using the prompt ``\\texttt{Continue the following text: \\{text\\}}''.\nWe generate up to depth~4 to empirically confirm convergence: 5-class analysis shows adjacent depths 2--4 become indistinguishable (F1\\,$\\approx$\\,0.27; Appendix~\\ref{app:finer-depth}), motivating the gen-2+ class collapse.\nAll generation uses temperature $\\tau{=}0.7$, nucleus sampling with $p{=}0.9$, and maximum length of 256 new tokens.\nAfter filtering chain breaks and passages too short for feature extraction, 37{,}058 texts remain across all depths (Appendix~\\ref{app:dataset-stats}); depths 2--4 are collapsed into $2{+}$.\n\n\\subsection{Feature Extraction}\n\\label{sec:features}\n\nThe seven features operationalize two complementary views of distributional drift: reference-model features capture how the token-level NLL distribution shifts relative to a fixed model (location and shape statistics), while surface features capture how lexical diversity contracts under recursive generation (type-token statistics).\nThis dual-view design enables the location/shape decomposition that constitutes our primary finding.\nWe deliberately use interpretable distributional statistics so that the DDR partition remains transparent and mechanistically informative; end-to-end neural features improve classification ($+$11.6\\,pp; Appendix~\\ref{app:qlora}) but obscure the decomposition.\nCross-group ablation (\\S\\ref{sec:results-differential}) and leave-one-feature-out analysis (Appendix~\\ref{app:lofo}) confirm that both feature groups contribute independently.\n\nWe extract seven distributional features per text, organized into two groups based on what they measure rather than how they are computed.\n\n\\paragraph{Reference-model features.}\nA held-out reference model (Pythia-410M, chosen to be smaller than all generators) computes per-token negative log-likelihood (NLL) for each text.\nWe use ``entropy'' as shorthand for token-level NLL throughout, following convention in prior detection work; these are point-wise NLL values, not Shannon entropy of the full distribution.\nAlthough Pythia-410M shares the GPT-NeoX architecture with two of the eight generators, cross-family reference model experiments (\\S\\ref{sec:results-differential}) confirm that depth features are not reference-specific (LOGO F1 varies by $\\leq$0.013 across Pythia, OLMo, and Qwen references).\nFrom the resulting NLL sequence, we extract five statistics:\n\\begin{itemize}[nosep,leftmargin=*]\n    \\item \\textbf{entropy\\_mean}: mean token-level NLL, which captures the average predictability of the text under the reference model;\n    \\item \\textbf{entropy\\_std}: standard deviation of token-level NLL, which measures the spread of per-token surprise;\n    \\item \\textbf{entropy\\_max}: maximum token-level NLL, which captures the most surprising token;\n    \\item \\textbf{entropy\\_min}: minimum token-level NLL, capturing the reference model's confidence floor on the most predictable token;\n    \\item \\textbf{tail\\_decay}: slope of the vocabulary-level averaged log-probability distribution in the mid-rank region (ranks 100--1000), capturing how steeply probability mass decays beyond high-frequency tokens.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\paragraph{Surface features.}\nTwo features capture lexical diversity without requiring a reference model:\n\\begin{itemize}[nosep,leftmargin=*]\n    \\item \\textbf{TTR}: type-token ratio (number of unique word types divided by total tokens);\n    \\item \\textbf{hapax\\_ratio}: proportion of words appearing exactly once (\\emph{hapax legomena}).\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\paragraph{Feature complementarity.}\nThese features exhibit a \\emph{differential depth response} (DDR), separating into drifting and non-drifting groups (\\S\\ref{sec:results-differential}; pairwise correlations in Appendix~\\ref{sec:appendix-feature-correlation}).\nTTR and hapax ratio are strongly correlated ($r = 0.97$); both are retained for marginal LOFO gains.\n\n\\subsection{Evaluation Protocol}\n\\label{sec:evaluation}\n\n\\paragraph{Cross-validation.}\nTo evaluate generalization, we use \\textbf{Leave-One-Generator-Out (LOGO)} cross-validation over all eight generators.\nLOGO holds out individual generators but does not isolate family effects; \\textbf{Leave-One-Family-Out (LOFO)} addresses this by holding out entire model families (binary F1\\,=\\,0.686; \\S\\ref{sec:results-classification}).\nGenerator subsets vary across experiments (Appendix~\\ref{app:gen-subsets-section}).\n\n\\paragraph{Classifier.}\nWe use XGBoost \\cite{xgboost} throughout ($n\\_\\text{estimators}{=}200$, $\\max\\_\\text{depth}{=}6$, learning rate $0.1$), with identical hyperparameters across all methods in Table~\\ref{tab:baselines}.\nAlternative classifiers (CORAL \\cite{coral_ordinal}, CORN \\cite{corn_ordinal}, Frank-Hall \\cite{frank_hall_ordinal}) yield comparable performance (Appendix~\\ref{app:classifier}); discriminative power resides in the features, not the classifier.\n\n\\paragraph{Metrics and statistical testing.}\nThe primary metric is \\textbf{macro-averaged F1} over the three depth classes, with 95\\% bootstrap CIs ($n{=}1{,}000$).\nAll $p$-values are two-sided with Bonferroni correction within each family of simultaneous tests.\n\n\\paragraph{Baselines.}\nWe compare the 7-feature ensemble against four single-score detection methods repurposed as depth predictors: Avg-LogProb, FastDetectGPT \\cite{fast_detectgpt}, Binoculars \\cite{binoculars}, and LD-Score \\cite{ld_score}.\nEach baseline score is used as a univariate feature in the same XGBoost framework under LOGO cross-validation to ensure a controlled comparison.\n\n\\paragraph{Length confound control.}\nSince TTR and hapax\\_ratio are mechanically length-dependent, we verify depth signal is not a length artifact via length-matched subsampling that equalizes length distributions across depth classes (\\S\\ref{sec:results-classification}; Appendix~\\ref{app:length}).\n",

<details><summary>Logged reasoning block</summary>

```text
I've:
1. Added a feature summary table to Method §3.3 — this provides a visual anchor on page 3-4
2. Condensed the bullet-point feature descriptions to save space since the table provides the overview
3. Strengthened DDR novelty framing in Introduction and Discussion

Now let me compile to check the page count. The table adds some height but I removed the bullet-point descriptions, so it should roughly balance out.
