  "content": "\\section{Discussion}\n\\label{sec:discussion}\n\nOne hypothesis for the approximate stationarity of shape features is that the softmax architecture and fixed sampling parameters constrain distributional shape under standard decoding: recursive generation shifts context toward high-probability regions but does not alter the generation mechanism itself.\nSampling ablation supports this ($t \\in [0.5, 0.7]$: ${\\leq}0.3$\\,pp degradation; $t = 1.0$: $-6$\\,pp; Appendix~\\ref{app:sampling-sensitivity}), suggesting a tendency of standard decoding rather than an architectural guarantee.\nEntropy std ($|\\rho| = 0.17$) occupies an intermediate position between the drifting features ($|\\rho| > 0.60$) and the near-stationary tail decay ($|\\rho| = 0.04$).\nSemantic-preservation constraints attenuate drift (elaboration F1\\,=\\,0.730 vs.\\ continuation 0.781; Appendix~\\ref{app:prompt-type}), consistent with \\citet{broken_telephone}; cross-type transfer remains viable (F1\\,=\\,0.753).\n\nDocument-level gen-1 per-class F1\\,=\\,0.63 is insufficient for automated filtering but sufficient for corpus-level flagging ($O(1/\\sqrt{n})$ error scaling).\nThe primary difficulty is distinguishing gen-1 from gen-2+: 86\\% of binary errors are false negatives, with depth-2 error rate 48\\% vs.\\ 20\\% for depth-4 (Appendix~\\ref{app:error-analysis}).\nThis asymmetry follows from DDR: the first recursive step produces the smallest location shift; larger generators exacerbate the overlap (Mistral-7B error rate 45\\% vs.\\ Pythia-1B 18\\%).\nPer-generator F1 is highest for Pythia generators (0.718--0.724), which share the same architecture family as the Pythia-410M reference model; however, cross-reference experiments (Table~\\ref{tab:cross-ref}) show that alternative references (OLMo, Qwen) yield F1 within 0.013\\,pp, indicating that reference-family bias is limited.\nCross-temperature transfer shows substantial degradation when test-time temperature exceeds training-time settings: Qwen3-1.7B binary F1 drops from 0.789 (matched $t{=}0.7$) to 0.418 under temperature mismatch (Appendix~\\ref{app:cross-temp}), indicating that depth fingerprinting assumes matched or lower temperature at test time.\n\nModel collapse \\cite{curse_of_recursion,strong_model_collapse} describes degradation when models are \\emph{retrained} on their own outputs, losing distributional coverage through parameter updates.\nDDR operates in a different regime: inference-chain drift occurs with fixed parameters, is fully reversible, and affects shape features an order of magnitude less than central-tendency features.\nThree classes represent the practical resolution ceiling (5-class F1\\,$\\approx$\\,0.50; Appendix~\\ref{app:finer-depth}); QLoRA fine-tuning recovers F1\\,=\\,0.905 (Appendix~\\ref{app:qlora}), confirming richer signal beyond summary statistics.\nDepth signal resides in generative structure rather than surface tokens: LLM-simulated sentence regeneration (50\\% edit distance) causes comparable degradation to 5\\% random word replacement (Appendix~\\ref{app:human-edit}).\nInstruction-tuned models show substantially weaker fingerprints (OLMo-Instruct LOGO F1\\,=\\,0.338 vs.\\ 0.763 base), justifying our restriction to base models.\n"

    "originalFile": "\\section{Method}\n\\label{sec:method}\n\n\\begin{figure*}[t]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{fig2_framework.pdf}\n\\caption{Overview of the depth fingerprinting framework. Given a text, reference-model features (entropy statistics under Pythia-410M) and surface features (lexical diversity) are extracted and fed to an XGBoost classifier trained under Leave-One-Generator-Out cross-validation. The feature set combines drifting indicators (entropy mean, TTR, hapax ratio) that capture the monotonic location shift with stationary indicators (entropy max, tail decay) that provide a stable baseline, exploiting their differential depth response for ordinal classification.}\n\\label{fig:framework}\n\\end{figure*}\n\n\\subsection{Task Formulation}\n\\label{sec:task}\n\nGiven a text $x$, the goal is to predict its \\emph{generation depth} $d \\in \\{0, 1, 2{+}\\}$, where $d{=}0$ denotes human-written text, $d{=}1$ denotes first-generation LLM output conditioned on human text, and $d{=}2{+}$ denotes text produced by recursively conditioning an LLM on its own prior output at least twice.\nFormally, let $\\mathcal{C}_0$ be a reference corpus of human-written text.\nA generation chain of depth $k$ is defined recursively: $x^{(0)} \\sim \\mathcal{C}_0$, and $x^{(k)} = G(x^{(k-1)})$ for $k \\geq 1$, where $G$ denotes stochastic LLM generation conditioned on its input.\nWe frame depth estimation as an ordinal classification task over three classes rather than binary real-vs-synthetic detection, enabling finer-grained provenance characterization.\nDepths beyond 2 are merged into a single $2{+}$ class, consistent with monotonic feature convergence that compresses inter-class margins beyond depth 2 (\\S\\ref{sec:results-differential}).\n\n\\subsection{Generation Chain Construction}\n\\label{sec:generation}\n\nWe construct generation chains using eight generators spanning five model families: \\textbf{Pythia} (2.8B, 1B) \\cite{pythia}, \\textbf{OLMo} (OLMo-2-1B) \\cite{olmo}, \\textbf{Qwen} (Qwen3-1.7B, Qwen3-0.6B, Qwen3-8B-Base) \\cite{qwen3}, \\textbf{Llama} (Llama-3.2-3B) \\cite{llama3}, and \\textbf{Mistral} (Mistral-7B-v0.3) \\cite{mistral7b}.\nThis selection covers parameter scales from 0.6B to 8B and diverse pretraining corpora, enabling evaluation of cross-generator and cross-scale generalization.\n\nFor each generator, we sample approximately 1{,}000 seed passages from English Wikipedia as $\\mathcal{C}_0$.\nThe same pool of seed passages serves as gen-0 for all generators.\nWe use shared seeds across generators to ensure that cross-generator comparisons control for input content, isolating the effect of the generation model from source text variation.\nIn LOGO evaluation, gen-0 samples from the held-out generator's chains also appear (with the same text) in the training generators' chains, creating a potential train--test overlap for the gen-0 class.\nWe address this with a supplementary binary evaluation excluding gen-0 entirely (\\S\\ref{sec:results-baselines}).\nEach seed is iteratively fed through the generator to produce a chain of depth 4 (i.e., gen-0 through gen-4), using the prompt ``\\texttt{Continue the following text: \\{text\\}}''.\nAll generation uses temperature $\\tau{=}0.7$, nucleus sampling with $p{=}0.9$, and maximum length of 256 new tokens.\nThe theoretical yield is $8 \\times {\\sim}1{,}000 \\times 5 \\approx 40{,}000$ texts; after removing generation failures, exact duplicates, and passages shorter than 50 tokens, 37{,}058 texts remain (Appendix~\\ref{app:dataset-stats}).\nFor classification, depths 2--4 are collapsed into the $2{+}$ class.\n\n\\subsection{Feature Extraction}\n\\label{sec:features}\n\nThe seven features are motivated by two complementary views of distributional drift.\nReference-model features capture how the text's token-level surprise distribution shifts relative to a fixed model; surface features capture how lexical diversity contracts under recursive generation.\nTogether, they span both the generative mechanism (what the model produces) and the surface manifestation (how the vocabulary changes); Figure~\\ref{fig:framework} provides an overview.\nThis two-pronged design is not post-hoc: it follows directly from the hypothesis that recursive generation induces a location shift in the NLL distribution (\\S\\ref{sec:results-differential}).\n\nWe extract seven distributional features per text, organized into two groups based on what they measure rather than how they are computed.\n\n\\paragraph{Reference-model features.}\nA held-out reference model (Pythia-410M, chosen to be smaller than all generators) computes per-token negative log-likelihood (NLL) for each text.\nAlthough Pythia-410M shares the GPT-NeoX architecture with two of the eight generators, cross-family reference model experiments (\\S\\ref{sec:results-differential}) confirm that depth features are not reference-specific (LOGO F1 varies by $\\leq$0.013 across Pythia, OLMo, and Qwen references).\nFrom the resulting NLL sequence, we extract five statistics:\n\\begin{itemize}[nosep,leftmargin=*]\n    \\item \\textbf{entropy\\_mean}\\footnote{We use ``entropy'' as shorthand for token-level negative log-likelihood under the reference model, following convention in prior detection work. These are point-wise NLL values, not Shannon entropy of the full distribution.}: mean token-level NLL, capturing the average predictability of the text under the reference model;\n    \\item \\textbf{entropy\\_std}: standard deviation of token-level NLL, measuring the spread of per-token surprise;\n    \\item \\textbf{entropy\\_max}: maximum token-level NLL, capturing the most surprising token;\n    \\item \\textbf{entropy\\_min}: minimum token-level NLL, capturing the most predictable token. As generation depth increases, the floor of token-level surprise drops, reflecting the model's increasing confidence on its own outputs.\n    Although entropy\\_min shows near-zero marginal impact in leave-one-feature-out analysis ($\\Delta$F1\\,=\\,+0.01\\,pp), we retain it for completeness of the NLL summary statistics (mean, std, max, min) and because removing it does not improve performance;\n    \\item \\textbf{tail\\_decay}: slope of the vocabulary-level averaged log-probability distribution in the mid-rank region (ranks 100--1000).\n    For each text, we compute the mean log-probability of each vocabulary token across all positions under the reference model, sort tokens in descending order of mean log-probability, and fit a linear regression to ranks 100--1000.\n    The slope captures how steeply the reference model's probability mass decays beyond high-probability tokens, characterizing the shape of the distribution tail.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\paragraph{Surface features.}\nTwo features capture lexical diversity without requiring a reference model:\n\\begin{itemize}[nosep,leftmargin=*]\n    \\item \\textbf{TTR}: type-token ratio (number of unique word types divided by total tokens);\n    \\item \\textbf{hapax\\_ratio}: proportion of words appearing exactly once (\\emph{hapax legomena}).\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\paragraph{Feature complementarity.}\nThe grouping reflects an empirical pattern we term \\emph{differential depth response}: central-tendency and diversity features (entropy\\_mean, TTR, hapax\\_ratio) show substantial monotonic drift with generation depth ($|\\rho| = 0.60$--$0.63$); entropy\\_min and entropy\\_std show moderate drift ($|\\rho| = 0.17$--$0.41$); and shape features (entropy\\_max, tail\\_decay) remain near-stationary ($|\\rho| < 0.10$).\nThis differential behavior, consistent with recursive generation shifting the location of the NLL distribution while preserving distributional shape, motivates combining both feature types.\nAs shown in \\S\\ref{sec:results}, the full 7-feature set significantly outperforms either group alone.\n\n\\subsection{Evaluation Protocol}\n\\label{sec:evaluation}\n\n\\paragraph{Cross-validation.}\nTo evaluate generalization to unseen generators, we use \\textbf{Leave-One-Generator-Out (LOGO)} cross-validation: in each fold, one of the eight generators is held out for testing and the remaining seven provide training data.\nWe additionally report \\textbf{Leave-One-Family-Out (LOFO)} results, where an entire model family (e.g., all Qwen models) is held out, testing generalization across architectural lineages.\n\n\\paragraph{Classifier.}\nWe use XGBoost \\cite{xgboost} throughout ($n\\_\\text{estimators}{=}200$, $\\max\\_\\text{depth}{=}6$, learning rate $0.1$), with identical hyperparameters across all methods in Table~\\ref{tab:baselines}.\nLOGO F1 is stable across random seeds (std\\,$<$\\,0.001 over 5 seeds).\nAlternative classifiers and ordinal-specific methods (CORAL \\cite{coral_ordinal}, Frank-Hall \\cite{frank_hall_ordinal}) yield comparable performance (Appendix~\\ref{app:classifier}), confirming that discriminative power resides in the features.\n\n\\paragraph{Metrics and statistical testing.}\nThe primary metric is \\textbf{macro-averaged F1} over the three depth classes.\nWe report 95\\% confidence intervals via percentile bootstrap ($n{=}1{,}000$), McNemar tests for pairwise comparisons, and paired bootstrap for baseline comparisons.\nAll $p$-values are two-sided; Bonferroni correction is applied where multiple comparisons arise.\nFeature--depth correlations (\\S\\ref{sec:results-differential}) use class-balanced subsamples to control for depth-class imbalance.\n\n\\paragraph{Baselines.}\nWe compare the 7-feature ensemble against four single-score detection methods repurposed as ordinal depth predictors: Avg-LogProb, FastDetectGPT \\cite{fast_detectgpt}, Binoculars \\cite{binoculars}, and LD-Score \\cite{ld_score}.\nEach baseline score is used as a univariate feature in the same XGBoost framework under LOGO cross-validation, ensuring a controlled comparison.\n\n\\paragraph{Length confound control.}\nSince TTR and hapax\\_ratio are mechanically length-dependent, we verify depth signal is not a length artifact via length-matched subsampling that equalizes length distributions across depth classes (\\S\\ref{sec:results-classification}; Appendix~\\ref{app:length}).\n",

7	The 7-feature ensemble achieves 3-class LOGO F1\,=\,0.762 (95\% CI [0.758, 0.766]; $N$\,=\,37{,}058) across eight generators from five families (Table~\ref{tab:logo-results}).
8	Because gen-0 seeds are shared across generators (\S\ref{sec:generation}), the 3-class metric may carry upward bias from memorized gen-0 patterns; we therefore also report a leak-free binary metric (gen-1 vs.\ gen-2+): F1\,=\,0.694, CI [0.688, 0.700], which is unaffected by this sharing.
9	Per-generator binary F1 ranges from 0.633 (Mistral-7B) to 0.724 (Pythia-2.8B); the primary difficulty is distinguishing gen-1 from gen-2+ (Appendix~\ref{app:confusion}).
10	Larger generators show moderate degradation (Qwen3-8B: 0.692, Mistral-7B: 0.633) relative to the 0.694 average.
11	
12	\paragraph{Cross-model generalization.}
13	Cross-model chains (randomly selected generator per step) yield 3-class F1\,=\,0.809 and binary F1\,=\,0.764 under 5-fold CV,\footnote{Cross-model chains use the original five-generator subset (Pythia, OLMo, Qwen); Llama and Mistral were added later for single-generator evaluation.} confirming that depth signal persists when text passes through heterogeneous generators.
14	The higher cross-model performance relative to single-generator LOGO (3-class: 0.809 vs.\ 0.762) suggests that generator heterogeneity amplifies distributional shifts between depths, making each recursive step more distinct.
15	Under class balancing, macro F1 reaches 0.831 (per-class breakdown in Appendix~\ref{app:cross-model-detail}).

4	\subsection{Depth Classification Performance}
5	\label{sec:results-classification}
6	
7	The 7-feature ensemble achieves 3-class LOGO F1\,=\,0.762 (95\% CI [0.758, 0.766]; $N$\,=\,37{,}058) across eight generators from five families (Table~\ref{tab:logo-results}).
8	Because gen-0 seeds are shared across generators (\S\ref{sec:generation}), the 3-class metric may carry upward bias from memorized gen-0 patterns; we therefore also report a leak-free binary metric (gen-1 vs.\ gen-2+): F1\,=\,0.694, CI [0.688, 0.700], which is unaffected by this sharing.
9	Per-generator binary F1 ranges from 0.633 (Mistral-7B) to 0.724 (Pythia-2.8B); the primary difficulty is distinguishing gen-1 from gen-2+ (Appendix~\ref{app:confusion}).
10	Larger generators show moderate degradation (Qwen3-8B: 0.692, Mistral-7B: 0.633) relative to the 0.694 average.
11	
12	\paragraph{Cross-model generalization.}
13	Cross-model chains (randomly selected generator per step) yield 3-class F1\,=\,0.809 and binary F1\,=\,0.764 under 5-fold CV,\footnote{Cross-model chains use the original five-generator subset (Pythia, OLMo, Qwen); Llama and Mistral were added later for single-generator evaluation.} confirming that depth signal persists when text passes through heterogeneous generators.
14	The higher cross-model performance relative to single-generator LOGO (3-class: 0.809 vs.\ 0.762) suggests that generator heterogeneity amplifies distributional shifts between depths, making each recursive step more distinct.
15	Under class balancing, macro F1 reaches 0.831 (per-class breakdown in Appendix~\ref{app:cross-model-detail}).
16	
17	Leave-one-family-out (LOFO) evaluation yields average binary F1\,=\,0.686, confirming transfer across architectural families.
18	A scale effect emerges: Pythia generators achieve the highest binary F1 (0.718--0.724), while larger models show degradation (Mistral-7B: 0.633), consistent with higher-capacity models compressing the feature margins DDR exploits.
19	The signal generalizes across text domains with variation (Appendix~\ref{app:domain}).
20	
21	\paragraph{Length confound control.}
22	Length-matched subsampling yields binary F1\,=\,0.724 (vs.\ 0.770 unmatched; $\Delta$\,=\,$-$0.046); a random-subsample control at equal $N$ (F1\,=\,0.767) confirms the drop reflects deconfounding, not sample-size reduction.
23	Length accounts for $\approx$6\% of discriminative performance (Appendix~\ref{app:length}).

50	\subsection{Differential Depth Response}
51	\label{sec:results-differential}
52	
53	Features exhibit \emph{differential depth response} (DDR): central-tendency and diversity measures drift monotonically with depth, while shape measures remain near-stationary, consistent with recursive generation inducing a location shift in the NLL distribution while preserving its functional form.
54

58	\caption{Differential depth response: Spearman correlations between individual features and generation depth. Central-tendency and diversity features (hapax ratio, TTR, entropy mean) show substantial monotonic drift; entropy std ($|\rho|{=}0.17$) occupies an intermediate position; shape features (entropy max, tail decay) remain near-stationary ($|\rho| < 0.10$).}
59	\label{fig:feature-drift}
60	\end{figure}
61	
62	Pooled class-balanced Spearman correlations with depth confirm the split (Figure~\ref{fig:feature-drift}):
63	drifting features show substantial monotonic trends (hapax ratio $\rho = -0.63$, TTR $\rho = -0.61$, entropy mean $\rho = -0.60$),
64	while shape features remain near-stationary (tail decay $|\rho| = 0.04$); entropy std occupies an intermediate position ($|\rho| = 0.17$).
65	
66	\paragraph{Distributional shift quantification.}
67	Two-sample Kolmogorov--Smirnov tests between gen-1 and gen-2+ distributions isolate the recursive depth effect (excluding the initial human$\rightarrow$LLM transition): drifting features exhibit large distributional shifts (entropy mean KS\,=\,0.537, TTR\,=\,0.517, hapax ratio\,=\,0.516; all $p \approx 0$), while shape features show order-of-magnitude smaller shifts (entropy max KS\,=\,0.043, tail decay\,=\,0.052).
68	All seven features reach statistical significance after Bonferroni correction, but shape-feature KS statistics are ${\sim}10\times$ smaller than drifting features, supporting the ``approximately stationary'' characterization.
69	Entropy std occupies an intermediate position (KS\,=\,0.285), consistent with its borderline rank correlation.
70	Levene tests for variance homogeneity reject equal variance for all seven features ($p < 10^{-10}$), indicating that recursive generation alters spread as well as location, though the magnitude of variance change is substantially smaller for shape features (coefficient of variation shift $<$3\% for entropy max vs.\ $>$15\% for hapax ratio).
71	
72	\paragraph{Feature complementarity.}
73	Under 10-fold stratified CV, the full 7-feature set (F1\,=\,0.773) outperforms surface-only (F1\,=\,0.688) and reference-only (F1\,=\,0.713; McNemar $p \approx 0$; Table~\ref{tab:ablation}).
74	Reference-only yields higher binary F1 (0.833 vs.\ 0.695) since surface features introduce noise at the gen-1/gen-2+ boundary, but surface features are essential for 3-class gen-0 discrimination (Full 0.773 vs.\ Reference-only 0.713).
75	Permutation importance: hapax ratio (0.35), entropy mean (0.23), TTR (0.18); leave-one-feature-out confirms 6 of 7 features contribute positively (Appendix~\ref{app:lofo}).
76	
77	\paragraph{Cross-family reference models.}
78	Alternative references (OLMo-2-1B, Qwen3-0.6B) achieve comparable LOGO F1 (spread 0.013; Table~\ref{tab:cross-ref}), with consistently negative entropy drift, confirming DDR is a property of recursive generation.
79	
80	\paragraph{Temperature robustness.}
81	The method operates reliably within $t \in [0.5, 0.9]$: F1 varies by at most 1\,pp from the default $t{=}0.7$ across this range (Appendix~\ref{app:sampling-sensitivity}).
82	At $t{=}1.0$, performance degrades by ${\sim}6$\,pp as the primary depth signal collapses: entropy mean's Spearman correlation with depth drops from $\rho = -0.60$ to $\rho = -0.002$, indicating that high-temperature sampling injects sufficient token-level randomness to mask the systematic location shift that DDR exploits.

139	\subsection{Downstream Utility}
140	\label{sec:results-downstream}
141	
142	If depth fingerprinting reliably identifies recursive text, can it improve data curation?
143	Fine-tuning OLMo-2-0425-1B on five data variants (3 seeds each) yields two conclusions.
144	At equal sample count ($n$\,=\,3{,}951), depth-aware selection is practically equivalent to random subsampling (ppl 2.387 vs.\ 2.367; TOST $\pm$2\% relative margin, $p = 1.1 \times 10^{-4}$).
145	However, data quantity dominates: the full dataset ($n$\,=\,12{,}299, ppl\,=\,2.335) yields significantly lower perplexity than any depth-filtered subset, and TOST rejects equivalence at the same margin (Appendix~\ref{app:downstream}).
146	Depth composition per se does not determine training utility at fixed sample count.

```text
OK, I see the results.tex has already been updated with some changes from a previous session (notably line 22 with length confound details that are different from what I was working with, and lines 13-14 about cross-model with "higher cross-model performance" sentence, plus line 15 about class balancing).

Let me now make the changes the Director requested:

1. SF3: Add note about generator subset difference after §4.1 first paragraph
2. DDR wording fix in line 53: "consistent with recursive generation inducing a location shift in the NLL distribution while preserving its functional form" → weaken


3. Line 70 needs attention - the Levene test description is back to the longer version with the full variance change details, and line 74 appears to be cut off mid-sentence about the reference-only F1 comparison.

It looks like the file was modified between my earlier edits, so I need to work with the current state and tackle my three main fixes: adding the SF3 footnote after the first paragraph of §4.1, revising the DDR wording on line 53, and checking for any "ordinal depth" terminology in table captions that needs updating. I should also scan results.tex for any instances of "ordinal" that require changing.

1	\section*{Limitations}
2	\label{sec:limitations}
3	
4	All eight generators are base (pretrained) models.
5	This is a deliberate design choice: base models isolate the generation mechanism from instruction-tuning effects, enabling controlled study of recursive distributional drift.
6	However, web text is predominantly produced by instruction-tuned and RLHF-aligned models.
7	Preliminary instruct experiments confirm that depth signal degrades substantially under instruction tuning: OLMo-2-1B-Instruct drops to LOGO F1\,=\,0.338 (vs.\ 0.763 base) and Qwen3-0.6B with chat template to 0.667 (vs.\ 0.816 under a 7-generator split).
8	Length-matched analysis yields near-zero correlations ($|\rho| < 0.02$) and binary classification near chance (F1\,$\approx$\,0.5) for Qwen models, leaving interpretation ambiguous.
9	Extending depth fingerprinting to instruct models requires addressing these confounds (length regulation, format constraints, safety-driven distribution shaping) that instruction tuning introduces.
10	
11	Our experiments include generators up to 8.2B parameters (Qwen3-8B).
12	Depth signal persists at this scale (Qwen3-8B 3-class F1\,=\,0.714), but cross-scale transfer incurs a moderate gap vs.\ $\leq$2.8B generators (F1\,=\,0.77--0.81).
13	Frontier models (70B+) remain untested; their higher fluency may further compress feature margins.
14	
15	Differential depth response strength is prompt-type dependent: continuation chains show strongest drift (within-type F1\,=\,0.781) compared to elaboration (0.730), rewriting (0.737), and paraphrastic chains (binary F1\,=\,0.671 vs.\ 0.749 for continuation).
16	DDR is most reliably detected in continuation-style generation; near-paraphrastic settings approach the method's detection floor.
17	Cross-prompt-type transfer (LOPTO F1\,=\,0.753) confirms shared signal, yet additional prompt types (e.g., summarization, instruction following) and cross-generator $\times$ cross-prompt interactions remain untested.
18	
19	Our primary evaluation uses single-generator chains; cross-model chains (\S\ref{sec:results-classification}) confirm depth signal under generator heterogeneity (3-class F1\,=\,0.809, binary F1\,=\,0.764), though the eight generators represent a controlled laboratory setting rather than the full diversity of real-world contamination.
20	Simulated human editing (\S\ref{sec:discussion}) suggests graceful degradation, but the gap between simulated token replacement and real-world post-processing remains untested.
21	
22	The reference model is fixed to Pythia-410M throughout, although cross-family reference experiments (\S\ref{sec:results-differential}) confirm the phenomenon is not reference-specific (spread 0.013 across three references).
23	All seed texts in the main evaluation are English Wikipedia excerpts.
24	Cross-domain evaluation (Appendix~\ref{app:domain}) shows that depth signal persists across News, Academic, and Code domains (binary F1 $>$ 0.73 under LOGO at $t{=}1.0$), though a domain $\times$ temperature interaction exists: certain domain/generator combinations at lower temperature approach chance level (e.g., Academic domain binary F1\,=\,0.628 at $t{=}0.7$), suggesting that reference model calibration is critical for cross-domain deployment.
25	The reference model dependency (Pythia-410M, English-centric pretraining) limits non-English applicability and adds inference overhead relative to surface-feature-only approaches.
26	Generalization to other languages remains untested.
27	
28	Our default analysis uses fixed decoding parameters (temperature 0.7, nucleus $p{=}0.9$). A sampling ablation (Appendix~\ref{app:sampling-sensitivity}) shows robustness to moderate variation ($t \in [0.5, 0.7]$, ${\leq}0.3$\,pp) but substantial degradation at $t{=}1.0$ ($-6$\,pp), indicating that depth fingerprinting assumes standard decoding regimes.
29	
30	We use 3-class granularity (gen-0\,/\,gen-1\,/\,gen-2+). A 5-class evaluation (Appendix~\ref{app:finer-depth}) yields LOGO F1\,$\approx$\,0.50, with depths 2--4 mutually indistinguishable, validating the 3-class design as the practical resolution limit.

```text
That text is in results.tex, not limitations.tex. Let me add the gen-0 seeds sentence to limitations.tex in an appropriate location.

Let me add it after the cross-model chains paragraph (line 20), or near the gen-0 discussion. Actually, the most natural place is after line 8 (Qwen models leaving interpretation ambiguous), since it relates to evaluation methodology. Or better, after the first paragraph about the 3-class evaluation methodology.

Actually, the Director says to add it to Limitations. The sentence is: "Independent gen-0 seed sets per generator would eliminate potential memorization effects in 3-class LOGO evaluation; we report leak-free binary F1 as the primary metric to mitigate this limitation."


And the cross-temperature sentence: "Cross-temperature transfer shows substantial degradation when test-time temperature exceeds training-time settings, limiting deployment to scenarios where the generation temperature is approximately known."

I'll place the gen-0 sentence after the cross-model paragraph and the temperature sentence at the end of the decoding parameters section.
```

see \\citet{wu_survey_2025} and \\citet{jawahar_survey} for surveys.\nA persistent limitation is that these methods produce binary (real vs.\\ synthetic) decisions.\nRecent multi-class extensions (role recognition in human-LLM collaboration \\cite{beyond_binary}, multi-generator attribution \\cite{semeval2024_task8}) discriminate among different \\emph{sources} rather than recursive generation \\emph{depth}.\nEven when detection scores correlate with depth, they exhibit high cross-generator variance as ordinal predictors (binary F1 from 0.52 to 0.71; Table~\\ref{tab:baselines}), because each captures a single distributional property that generalizes inconsistently \\cite{paraphrase_evades,detection_possibilities}.\nAdversarial training approaches (e.g., RADAR \\cite{radar}) improve robustness to paraphrasing but remain binary detectors without depth awareness.\nOur contribution is not a new detection method but the task formulation (ordinal depth estimation, framed within the broader ordinal classification literature \\cite{gutierrez_ordinal_survey,coral_ordinal}) and the finding that combining drifting and stationary features yields consistent cross-generator performance.\nThis is orthogonal to source attribution \\cite{uchendu_attribution,munir_looking_glass}, which identifies \\emph{which} model generated text; our LOGO evaluation decouples generator identity from depth.\n\n\\subsection{Model Collapse and Iterative Generation}\n\\label{sec:related-collapse}\n\nSelf-consuming generative models progressively lose distributional coverage \\cite{self_consuming_mad}, and model collapse is inevitable without fresh human data \\cite{curse_of_recursion}, though careful data mixing can mitigate this \\cite{model_collapse_avoidable,strong_model_collapse}.\nThese studies focus on \\emph{training-loop} degradation; our setting studies \\emph{inference chains}, where a fixed model generates text conditioned on its own prior output without retraining.\nIterative self-refinement \\cite{self_refine} represents another form of recursive LLM processing, but targets output improvement through feedback loops rather than open-ended continuation; the distributional drift we study arises specifically from unconstrained recursive generation.\n\nTwo concurrent works are most directly relevant.\n\\citet{broken_telephone} analyze paraphrasing and translation chains, showing progressive information loss.\n\\citet{markovian_chains} demonstrate that semantic-preservation constraints induce attractor dynamics bounding distinguishable depth to approximately three classes; their analysis focuses on characterizing convergence behavior through model-based perplexity tracking.\nWe differ in three respects: (i) we study \\emph{non-paraphrastic continuation} chains, where the absence of semantic anchoring permits richer depth signal; (ii) we use handcrafted features rather than model-internal representations, enabling the DDR decomposition into drifting vs.\\ stationary components; and (iii) we focus on \\emph{estimating} depth from text rather than characterizing the convergence dynamics of the generation process.\n\nThat both works independently converge on approximately three distinguishable classes reflects different mechanisms reaching the same practical ceiling.\n\\citet{markovian_chains} derive this bound from Markovian attractor dynamics: semantic-preservation constraints create fixed points where successive outputs become indistinguishable under model-internal perplexity.\nWe observe the same bound empirically through feature-space compression: inter-class KS statistics drop sharply after depth 2 (gen-1$\\rightarrow$gen-2: KS\\,=\\,0.28 vs.\\ gen-2$\\rightarrow$gen-3: KS\\,=\\,0.09 for entropy mean), collapsing discriminative margins.\nThe approaches are complementary: their theoretical framework explains \\emph{why} convergence occurs (attractor dynamics in semantic space), while our DDR decomposition reveals \\emph{what} converges (location properties) versus what remains stable (distributional shape), providing an empirical signature that can be exploited for detection without access to model internals.\n\n\\subsection{Vocabulary Diversity and Stylometry}\n\\label{sec:related-diversity}\n\nDeclining lexical diversity in LLM-generated text is documented in both training \\cite{curious_decline} and deployment \\cite{writing_diversity} settings.\nOur surface features (TTR and hapax ratio) are classical stylometric measures \\cite{stamatatos_survey,koppel_authorship} that we apply to inference chains, showing monotonic diversity decline across depths without model retraining.\nWe push beyond generator identity \\cite{uchendu_attribution} to the \\emph{depth} dimension, and show that diversity declines monotonically even under top-$p$ sampling \\cite{nucleus_sampling}.\n\n\\subsection{Data Quality and Provenance}\n\\label{sec:related-provenance}\n\nScalable data curation relies on quality signals \\cite{dsir,qurating,ccnet}; generation depth is a complementary provenance signal characterizing \\emph{how many steps removed} text is from a human source.\nProactive watermarking \\cite{watermark_llm,synthid_text,aaronson_watermark} embeds identifiable patterns, but watermark strength decays across multi-step chains \\cite{chainwash}, motivating passive post-hoc methods like ours.\nAt the feature level, our NLL analysis connects to \\citet{min_k_percent}, who use the probability tail for membership inference; we analyze the full NLL distribution for ordinal depth estimation.\n",

    "originalFile": "\\section{Related Work}\n\\label{sec:related}\n\n\\subsection{AI-Generated Text Detection}\n\\label{sec:related-detection}\n\nMethods for distinguishing human-written from machine-generated text have evolved from statistical tests \\cite{gltr,grover,release_strategies} to zero-shot reference-model approaches \\cite{detectgpt,fast_detectgpt,binoculars,dna_gpt} and learned classifiers \\cite{ghostbuster,feat_aug_transformer,reliable_detection,ld_score}.\nRecent work pursues diverse signals including intrinsic dimensionality \\cite{intrinsic_dimension}, surprisal diversity \\cite{diveye}, and distributional gap measures \\cite{generator_barrier}; see \\citet{wu_survey_2025} and \\citet{jawahar_survey} for surveys.\nA persistent limitation is that these methods produce binary (real vs.\\ synthetic) decisions.\nRecent multi-class extensions (role recognition in human-LLM collaboration \\cite{beyond_binary}, multi-generator attribution \\cite{semeval2024_task8}) discriminate among different \\emph{sources} rather than recursive generation \\emph{depth}.\nEven when detection scores correlate with depth, they exhibit high cross-generator variance as ordinal predictors (binary F1 from 0.52 to 0.71; Table~\\ref{tab:baselines}), because each captures a single distributional property that generalizes inconsistently \\cite{paraphrase_evades,detection_possibilities}.\nAdversarial training approaches (e.g., RADAR \\cite{radar}) improve robustness to paraphrasing but remain binary detectors without depth awareness.\nOur contribution is not a new detection method but the task formulation (generation depth classification, framed within the broader ordinal classification literature \\cite{gutierrez_ordinal_survey,coral_ordinal}) and the finding that combining drifting and stationary features yields consistent cross-generator performance.\nThis is orthogonal to source attribution \\cite{uchendu_attribution,munir_looking_glass}, which identifies \\emph{which} model generated text; our LOGO evaluation decouples generator identity from depth.\n\n\\subsection{Model Collapse and Iterative Generation}\n\\label{sec:related-collapse}\n\nSelf-consuming generative models progressively lose distributional coverage \\cite{self_consuming_mad}, and model collapse is inevitable without fresh human data \\cite{curse_of_recursion}, though careful data mixing can mitigate this \\cite{model_collapse_avoidable,strong_model_collapse}.\nThese studies focus on \\emph{training-loop} degradation; our setting studies \\emph{inference chains}, where a fixed model generates text conditioned on its own prior output without retraining.\nIterative self-refinement \\cite{self_refine} represents another form of recursive LLM processing, but targets output improvement through feedback loops rather than open-ended continuation; the distributional drift we study arises specifically from unconstrained recursive generation.\n\nTwo concurrent works are most directly relevant.\n\\citet{broken_telephone} analyze paraphrasing and translation chains, showing progressive information loss.\n\\citet{markovian_chains} demonstrate that semantic-preservation constraints induce attractor dynamics bounding distinguishable depth to approximately three classes; their analysis focuses on characterizing convergence behavior through model-based perplexity tracking.\nWe differ in three respects: (i) we study \\emph{non-paraphrastic continuation} chains, where the absence of semantic anchoring permits richer depth signal; (ii) we use handcrafted features rather than model-internal representations, enabling the DDR decomposition into drifting vs.\\ stationary components; and (iii) we focus on \\emph{estimating} depth from text rather than characterizing the convergence dynamics of the generation process.\n\nThat both works independently converge on approximately three distinguishable classes reflects different mechanisms reaching the same practical ceiling.\n\\citet{markovian_chains} derive this bound from Markovian attractor dynamics: semantic-preservation constraints create fixed points where successive outputs become indistinguishable under model-internal perplexity.\nWe observe the same bound empirically through feature-space compression: inter-class KS statistics drop sharply after depth 2 (gen-1$\\rightarrow$gen-2: KS\\,=\\,0.28 vs.\\ gen-2$\\rightarrow$gen-3: KS\\,=\\,0.09 for entropy mean), collapsing discriminative margins.\nThe approaches are complementary: their theoretical framework explains \\emph{why} convergence occurs (attractor dynamics in semantic space), while our DDR decomposition reveals \\emph{what} converges (location properties) versus what remains stable (distributional shape), providing an empirical signature that can be exploited for detection without access to model internals.\n\n\\subsection{Vocabulary Diversity and Stylometry}\n\\label{sec:related-diversity}\n\nDeclining lexical diversity in LLM-generated text is documented in both training \\cite{curious_decline} and deployment \\cite{writing_diversity} settings.\nOur surface features (TTR and hapax ratio) are classical stylometric measures \\cite{stamatatos_survey,koppel_authorship} that we apply to inference chains, showing monotonic diversity decline across depths without model retraining.\nWe push beyond generator identity \\cite{uchendu_attribution} to the \\emph{depth} dimension, and show that diversity declines monotonically even under top-$p$ sampling \\cite{nucleus_sampling}.\n\n\\subsection{Data Quality and Provenance}\n\\label{sec:related-provenance}\n\nScalable data curation relies on quality signals \\cite{dsir,qurating,ccnet}; generation depth is a complementary provenance signal characterizing \\emph{how many steps removed} text is from a human source.\nProactive watermarking \\cite{watermark_llm,synthid_text,aaronson_watermark} embeds identifiable patterns, but watermark strength decays across multi-step chains \\cite{chainwash}, motivating passive post-hoc methods like ours.\nAt the feature level, our NLL analysis connects to \\citet{min_k_percent}, who use the probability tail for membership inference; we analyze the full NLL distribution for ordinal depth estimation.\n",

23	Two concurrent works are most directly relevant.
24	\citet{broken_telephone} analyze paraphrasing and translation chains, showing progressive information loss.
25	\citet{markovian_chains} demonstrate that semantic-preservation constraints induce attractor dynamics bounding distinguishable depth to approximately three classes; their analysis focuses on characterizing convergence behavior through model-based perplexity tracking.
26	We differ in three respects: (i) we study \emph{non-paraphrastic continuation} chains, where the absence of semantic anchoring permits richer depth signal; (ii) we use handcrafted features rather than model-internal representations, enabling the DDR decomposition into drifting vs.\ stationary components; and (iii) we focus on \emph{estimating} depth from text rather than characterizing the convergence dynamics of the generation process.
27	
28	That both works independently converge on approximately three distinguishable classes reflects different mechanisms reaching the same practical ceiling.
29	\citet{markovian_chains} derive this bound from Markovian attractor dynamics: semantic-preservation constraints create fixed points where successive outputs become indistinguishable under model-internal perplexity.
30	We observe the same bound empirically through feature-space compression: inter-class KS statistics drop sharply after depth 2 (gen-1$\rightarrow$gen-2: KS\,=\,0.28 vs.\ gen-2$\rightarrow$gen-3: KS\,=\,0.09 for entropy mean), collapsing discriminative margins.
31	The approaches are complementary: their theoretical framework explains \emph{why} convergence occurs (attractor dynamics in semantic space), while our DDR decomposition reveals \emph{what} converges (location properties) versus what remains stable (distributional shape), providing an empirical signature that can be exploited for detection without access to model internals.

Line 26 has "we focus on \emph{estimating} depth from text" which should be "classifying" instead of "estimating". And line 31 mentions "what remains stable (distributional shape)" which I should soften.

Let me fix these.

```text
The ordinal-specific methods sentence in the appendix classifier is fine - it's referring to specific ordinal classification methods (CORAL, Frank-Hall), not using "ordinal depth estimation" as a term. The Director says to confirm ordinal regression discussion uses the new terminology. Since this is about classifier types (ordinal regression methods), not about the task naming, it's fine to keep "Ordinal-specific methods."

Now let me also check if the method.tex still has "ordinal classification" in the right way.

The ordinal regression mention in the appendix is about classifier methods, not the task name, so it's fine. Let me also check for the DDR wording in the method.tex feature complementarity paragraph.

69	\paragraph{Feature complementarity.}
70	The grouping reflects an empirical pattern we term \emph{differential depth response}: central-tendency and diversity features (entropy\_mean, TTR, hapax\_ratio) show substantial monotonic drift with generation depth ($|\rho| = 0.60$--$0.63$); entropy\_min and entropy\_std show moderate drift ($|\rho| = 0.17$--$0.41$); and shape features (entropy\_max, tail\_decay) remain near-stationary ($|\rho| < 0.10$).
71	We adopt $|\rho| < 0.10$ as a practical threshold for near-zero monotonic association; empirically, features cluster into two groups with a clear gap between $|\rho| = 0.10$ and $|\rho| = 0.17$ (Figure~\ref{fig:feature-drift}).
72	This differential behavior, consistent with recursive generation shifting the location of the NLL distribution while shape features show an order-of-magnitude smaller effect, motivates combining both feature types.
73	As shown in \S\ref{sec:results}, the full 7-feature set significantly outperforms either group alone.

```text
The confusion matrix already says "6-generator" in line 1 and in the caption. It's already clear. Line 1 says "6-generator leave-one-generator-out (LOGO) evaluation". The Director said "加注说明 '6-generator subset' 如果现在是 6-gen" - it already says "6-generator". I think this is fine.

Let me also do a final check on the "ordinal" terminology - make sure I haven't missed any.
