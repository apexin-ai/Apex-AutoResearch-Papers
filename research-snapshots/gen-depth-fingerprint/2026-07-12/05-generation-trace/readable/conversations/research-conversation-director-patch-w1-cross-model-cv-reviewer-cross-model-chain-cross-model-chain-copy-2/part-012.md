    "originalFile": "\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{sec:introduction}\n\nAn estimated 7--17\\% of recent scientific publications already contain substantial LLM-modified content \\cite{mapping_llm_science,monitoring_ai_review}. As these outputs re-enter training corpora \\cite{dolma,fineweb} and seed further generation, text accumulates at varying \\emph{generation depths}; each successive cycle reshapes distributional properties in ways that matter for data provenance, corpus auditing, and contamination monitoring in base-model pretraining corpora \\cite{ccnet,dsir} as well as model collapse analysis \\cite{curse_of_recursion,strong_model_collapse}. Understanding \\emph{how} recursive generation alters text distributions---and which properties change versus which are preserved---is therefore a prerequisite for principled corpus curation, yet current methods address only binary human-or-machine detection \\cite{detectgpt,fast_detectgpt,binoculars,ld_score}.\nBase models provide the cleanest substrate to isolate depth effects from alignment-induced changes.\nWe find that recursive generation produces a decomposable depth profile: distributional \\emph{location} drifts with depth while \\emph{shape} remains stable across generators, an asymmetry sufficient for cross-generator depth prediction.\n\nDistributional compression under recursive generation is well-documented \\cite{curious_decline,broken_telephone,markovian_chains}, yet existing analyses characterize \\emph{that} and \\emph{why} convergence occurs without decomposing what drifts from what is preserved.\nWe introduce \\emph{depth profiling} (coarse ordinal classification into gen-0\\,/\\,gen-1\\,/\\,gen-2+; Figure~\\ref{fig:framework}), and decompose this compression into structurally distinct components: across eight base-model generators spanning five architectural families (0.6B--8B), the NLL distribution's central tendency (mean entropy (reference-model NLL), lexical diversity) drifts monotonically with depth while its shape (entropy extremes, tail structure) remains an order of magnitude more stable ($d{=}0.76$--$1.17$ vs.\\ $d < 0.10$ for three near-stationary features; entropy std is intermediate ($d{=}0.55$); boundary features show additional nuance; convergent effect-size measures confirm this partition).\nWe term this location/shape asymmetry the \\emph{differential depth response} (DDR; Figure~\\ref{fig:ddr-trajectory}), an empirical regularity of base-model autoregressive generation that is mechanistically distinct from model collapse \\cite{curse_of_recursion}, which erodes tail coverage via weight updates; DDR instead analyzes fixed-parameter inference chains.\nThe stationary shape component complements location drift for depth prediction without per-generator calibration.\n\n\\begin{figure*}[t!]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{fig2_framework.pdf}\n\\caption{Depth profiling framework. (a)~Recursive generation chain: a human-written seed (gen-0) is iteratively fed through a generator $G$ to produce text at successive depths; eight base-model LLMs across five families (0.6B--8B) serve as generators. (b)~Feature extraction: each text is scored by a fixed reference model (Pythia-410M), yielding five NLL statistics and two surface diversity measures (seven DDR features total). (c)~Leave-One-Generator-Out evaluation: XGBoost classifies each text into gen-0\\,/\\,gen-1\\,/\\,gen-2+ with one generator held out per fold.}\n\\label{fig:framework}\n\\end{figure*}\nWe focus on base (pretrained) models; instruction tuning degrades depth signal (Appendix~\\ref{app:instruct}).\n\nAs a proof of concept, a lightweight 7-feature ensemble informed by DDR achieves leak-free binary F1\\,=\\,0.694 under leave-one-generator-out evaluation, matching multi-detector ensembles at ${\\sim}2.4\\times$ lower cost; an end-to-end QLoRA classifier reaches 3-class F1\\,=\\,0.905 (6-gen LOGO; Appendix~\\ref{app:qlora}), confirming that the depth signal extends well beyond handcrafted features.\n\nOur contributions:\n\\begin{enumerate}[nosep,leftmargin=*]\n    \\item \\textbf{Empirical decomposition (DDR).} Across eight generators from five families, we decompose inference-chain drift into a location component that shifts monotonically ($d{=}0.76$--$1.17$) and a shape component that remains near-stationary ($d < 0.10$ for three near-stationary features).

<details><summary>Logged reasoning block</summary>

```text
Page 8 has Discussion, Conclusion, and Limitations starting. Page 9 has the rest of Limitations and References. The main text (through Conclusion) is on page 8. Limitations overflows to page 9 which is fine (doesn't count toward page limit). References start on page 9.

Wait, let me check more carefully. The last line on page 8 is "classification relies on. An end-to-end QLoRA" — this is from the expanded Limitations section. So the Limitations content continues onto... let me check page 9.


Actually, looking at the P8 last content: "classification relies on. An end-to-end QLoRA" — this is from my expanded Limitations text: "...attenuating the DDR signal that depth classification relies on. An end-to-end QLoRA classifier partially recovers..."

So Limitations starts on page 8 and continues to page 9. That's fine per EMNLP rules. I've got 0 undefined references, 37 pages total, and the main text is within the ≤ 8 page limit. Everything checks out, so I'm ready to sync and report.

[服务器重启后首条消息] 当前日期: 2026-05-23。服务器刚重启，项目状态可能已更新。不要依赖对话历史中的状态信息，以 registry 当前值为准。

**用户消息：** [Director 指令] [Patch] 三处文本修改，基于 Reviewer 终审 + 用户要求。引用不需要验证。

**修改 1: Abstract 完善**
按 distilled writing skill（Intro Patterns / Named-Problem Technique），检查 abstract 是否：
- 首次出现 $d$ 时消歧为 "Cohen's $d$" 或 "effect size $d$"——当前 abstract 用裸 $d$，与 generation depth 的 $d$ 符号冲突
- 叙事紧凑，societal hook → gap → method → finding → scope limitation 结构清晰

**修改 2: Introduction 完善**
- Introduction:9 同样有裸 $d$ 问题，首次出现处改为 "effect size $d$" 或 "(Cohen's $d$)"
- Contribution 1 的 "three response zones" 与 Results 中 "two-cluster ($k=2$)" 有措辞矛盾。实际是 binary partition + one intermediate outlier。改为 "a drifting–stationary partition with one intermediate feature" 或 "two primary response zones (drifting vs. near-stationary) plus an intermediate feature"
- 检查 4-paragraph 结构是否符合 distilled writing skill 的 pattern（societal urgency hook → elimination of prior approaches → our method/finding → contributions）

**修改 3: Limitations 压缩**
当前 Limitations 有 3 段 ~15 行，太长。用户规则："Limitations 章节只需要写一小段，覆盖 3 个点左右就可以了，不需要写得很长"。

压缩为 1 小段，覆盖 3 个核心点：
1. Base models only（≤8B，instruct degradation，QLoRA partial recovery）
2. English-only + fixed decoding regime
3. 3-class depth resolution ceiling

删除过多细节（Gemma-2 具体数字、perturbation robustness 细节、instruct-specific feature engineering 建议等），这些在 appendix 中已有覆盖。

**注意**：Discussion 中 "Granger causality confirms the causal direction" 也需要改为 "Granger causality tests support the predictive direction"，这是审稿人常见攻击点。

1	% Abstract — Depth Profiling of Recursive LLM Generation Chains
2	\begin{abstract}
3	As LLM outputs re-enter training corpora and seed further generation, understanding how recursive generation reshapes text distributions becomes important for data provenance and corpus curation---yet existing detectors answer only the binary human-or-machine question, ignoring \emph{generation depth}: we introduce \emph{depth profiling} to address this gap.
4	We decompose distributional drift under recursive generation into location and shape components, revealing an asymmetry we term \emph{differential depth response} (DDR): across eight base-model generators from five families, NLL location features drift monotonically with depth ($d{=}0.76$--$1.17$) while three shape features remain near-stationary ($d < 0.10$), with entropy std intermediate ($d{=}0.55$).
5	Prior work documents \emph{what converges}; the central finding here is \emph{what is approximately preserved}: shape stability complements location drift for ordinal depth grading without per-generator calibration, achieving leak-free binary F1\,=\,0.694 (gen-1 vs.\ gen-2+) and 3-class F1\,=\,0.762 (gen-0 seeds shared across generators; \S\ref{sec:generation}) under leave-one-generator-out evaluation; an end-to-end classifier reaches 3-class F1\,=\,0.905 (6-gen LOGO; Appendix~\ref{app:qlora}).
6	Instruction tuning compresses DDR, bounding current applicability to base models.

1	\section{Introduction}
2	\label{sec:introduction}
3	
4	An estimated 7--17\% of recent scientific publications already contain substantial LLM-modified content \cite{mapping_llm_science,monitoring_ai_review}. As these outputs re-enter training corpora \cite{dolma,fineweb} and seed further generation, text accumulates at varying \emph{generation depths}; each successive cycle reshapes distributional properties in ways that matter for data provenance, corpus auditing, and contamination monitoring in base-model pretraining corpora \cite{ccnet,dsir} as well as model collapse analysis \cite{curse_of_recursion,strong_model_collapse}. Understanding \emph{how} recursive generation alters text distributions---and which properties change versus which are preserved---is therefore a prerequisite for principled corpus curation, yet current methods address only binary human-or-machine detection \cite{detectgpt,fast_detectgpt,binoculars,ld_score}.
5	Base models provide the cleanest substrate to isolate depth effects from alignment-induced changes.
6	We find that recursive generation produces a decomposable depth profile: distributional \emph{location} drifts with depth while \emph{shape} remains stable across generators, an asymmetry sufficient for cross-generator depth prediction.
7	
8	Distributional compression under recursive generation is well-documented \cite{curious_decline,broken_telephone,markovian_chains}, yet existing analyses characterize \emph{that} and \emph{why} convergence occurs without decomposing what drifts from what is preserved.
9	We introduce \emph{depth profiling} (coarse ordinal classification into gen-0\,/\,gen-1\,/\,gen-2+; Figure~\ref{fig:framework}), and decompose this compression into structurally distinct components: across eight base-model generators spanning five architectural families (0.6B--8B), the NLL distribution's central tendency (mean entropy (reference-model NLL), lexical diversity) drifts monotonically with depth while its shape (entropy extremes, tail structure) remains an order of magnitude more stable ($d{=}0.76$--$1.17$ vs.\ $d < 0.10$ for three near-stationary features; entropy std is intermediate ($d{=}0.55$); boundary features show additional nuance; convergent effect-size measures confirm this partition).
10	We term this location/shape asymmetry the \emph{differential depth response} (DDR; Figure~\ref{fig:ddr-trajectory}), an empirical regularity of base-model autoregressive generation that is mechanistically distinct from model collapse \cite{curse_of_recursion}, which erodes tail coverage via weight updates; DDR instead analyzes fixed-parameter inference chains.
11	The stationary shape component complements location drift for depth prediction without per-generator calibration.
12	
13	\begin{figure*}[t!]
14	\centering
15	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{fig2_framework.pdf}
16	\caption{Depth profiling framework. (a)~Recursive generation chain: a human-written seed (gen-0) is iteratively fed through a generator $G$ to produce text at successive depths; eight base-model LLMs across five families (0.6B--8B) serve as generators. (b)~Feature extraction: each text is scored by a fixed reference model (Pythia-410M), yielding five NLL statistics and two surface diversity measures (seven DDR features total). (c)~Leave-One-Generator-Out evaluation: XGBoost classifies each text into gen-0\,/\,gen-1\,/\,gen-2+ with one generator held out per fold.}
17	\label{fig:framework}
18	\end{figure*}
19	We focus on base (pretrained) models; instruction tuning degrades depth signal (Appendix~\ref{app:instruct}).
20	
21	As a proof of concept, a lightweight 7-feature ensemble informed by DDR achieves leak-free binary F1\,=\,0.694 under leave-one-generator-out evaluation, matching multi-detector ensembles at ${\sim}2.4\times$ lower cost; an end-to-end QLoRA classifier reaches 3-class F1\,=\,0.905 (6-gen LOGO; Appendix~\ref{app:qlora}), confirming that the depth signal extends well beyond handcrafted features.
22	
23	Our contributions:
24	\begin{enumerate}[nosep,leftmargin=*]
25	    \item \textbf{Empirical decomposition (DDR).} Across eight generators from five families, we decompose inference-chain drift into three response zones: drifting ($d{=}0.76$--$1.17$), intermediate ($d{=}0.55$), and near-stationary ($d < 0.10$). Where prior work documents \emph{what converges} \cite{curious_decline,markovian_chains}, DDR identifies \emph{what is approximately preserved}, an empirical regularity with analytical utility for depth classification without per-generator calibration. DDR is a descriptive empirical finding; the classification value lies in this decomposition rather than the classifier itself.
26	    \item \textbf{Task formulation and evaluation suite.} We define generation depth classification as an ordinal prediction task and construct a controlled dataset of 37K texts from eight generators across five families (0.6B--8B; exploratory evidence extends to 14B, Appendix~\ref{app:9gen-scale}), with leave-one-generator-out cross-validation as the primary evaluation protocol.
27	    \item \textbf{Scope characterization.} Systematic evaluation across temperature, prompt type, instruction tuning, model scale, domain transfer, and perturbation robustness maps the operational envelope of depth profiling.
28	\end{enumerate}

English-only evaluation limits generalizability; DDR's reliance on reference-model NLL may behave differently for morphologically rich or low-resource languages where tokenization and vocabulary coverage differ substantially. Perturbation robustness (Appendix~\ref{app:human-edit}) tests only random word replacement; adversarial paraphrasing, which preserves semantics while altering surface form, remains untested and may degrade DDR signal more severely.

15	Depth resolution is bounded at three classes (gen-0\,/\,gen-1\,/\,gen-2+); finer-grained 5-class classification yields F1\,$\approx$\,0.50 with deeper depths mutually indistinguishable (Appendix~\ref{app:finer-depth}).

Now I have all the files. Let me plan the edits:

**修改 1: Abstract 完善**
- Bare `$d$` → disambiguate as "effect size $d$" or "Cohen's $d$" at first occurrence
- Line 4: First `$d$` appears in "$d{=}0.76$--$1.17$" — need to change to "effect-size $d{=}0.76$..." or "(Cohen's $d{=}0.76$...)"
- The second occurrence on line 4: "$d < 0.10$" and "$d{=}0.55$" — these are subsequent and don't need re-disambiguation


- I'll use "effect size $d$" for the first mention since it's clearer and avoids the potential confusion with generation depth. The abstract sentence becomes: "NLL location features drift monotonically with depth (effect size $d{=}0.76$--$1.17$) while three shape features remain near-stationary ($d < 0.10$), with entropy std intermediate ($d{=}0.55$)."

- I need to fix the same issue in the Introduction where bare `$d$` appears. Line 9 should also get "effect size" on first mention.

- There's a contradiction in Contribution #1 that needs resolving: it claims "three response zones" but the Results section describes a "two-cluster" partition. I'll revise this to align with the binary partition finding, using "a drifting–stationary partition (effect size $d{=}0.76$--$1.17$)" instead.

- The Director's suggestion to say "two primary response zones (drifting vs. near-stationary) plus an intermediate feature" is clearer and more explicit, so I'm going with that phrasing.

- Checking the 4-paragraph structure: P1 covers societal urgency, P2 addresses the gap and our method, P3 presents proof of concept, and I need to verify P4 completes the structure properly.

Now I'm working on compressing the Limitations section from three paragraphs down to one short paragraph. The key constraints to highlight are that we're limited to base models under 8B parameters (instruction-tuned versions lose the depth signal), the evaluation is English-only with a fixed decoding setup, and we can only resolve three depth classes. I'll strip out the Gemma-2 specifics and the perturbation robustness details to keep it tight. I'm noting that the instruction-tuned variants significantly degrade the depth signal, though QLoRA fine-tuning can partially recover it, indicating the information is still present but compressed. The evaluation is constrained by several factors: English Wikipedia seeds, fixed temperature settings, and an English-centric reference model, with cross-lingual and cross-temperature generalization remaining unexplored. The depth classification is limited to three coarse categories, and attempts at finer-grained five-class resolution show the model struggles to distinguish deeper generations.

For the discussion section, I should update the Granger causality phrasing to emphasize the predictive direction rather than strict causality. Then I'll apply the specific edits to the abstract and introduction, adding "effect size" before the Cohen's d values and adjusting the comparison language. I'm refining the effect-size language to clarify the partition structure—distinguishing the two primary response zones with their contrasting effect sizes while treating the intermediate feature separately, then I need to update the limitations section and adjust the causal language in the discussion to be more precise about what the statistical tests actually show.

[Director 指令] [Patch] 正文图表重构——删除框架图，提升 headline result 为 Figure 1，新增 2 张实验图。引用不需要验证。

用户明确指令："框架图效果不好，不要了，我们直接将headline result作为主图"，"正文的实验图再加1-2张，正文内容需要信息量大，体现实验工作量"。

**具体改动**：

### 1. 删除框架图
- introduction.tex 中删除 `\begin{figure*}...\end{figure*}` 包含 fig2_framework.pdf 的整个 figure 环境（约 line 13-18）
- 正文提到 "Figure~\ref{fig:framework}" 的地方改为文字描述或删除引用
- 注意：caption 中的方法描述很好，可以保留到正文中作为 inline 描述

### 2. DDR strip plot 提升为 Figure 1
- 当前 fig1_differential_response.pdf 在 results.tex 约 line 73-78（标记为 fig:feature-drift）
- 把它移到 Introduction 中（framework 图被删后的位置），作为 Figure 1
- 用 figure*（双栏宽）或 figure（单栏）均可，单栏可能更好（strip plot 不需要全宽）
- 更新 caption，强调这是核心发现

### 3. 新增 Convergence Dynamics 图
- 文件已存在：fig_convergence_dynamics.pdf
- 插入到 Results 的 DDR validation 或 depth analysis 相关段落附近
- 单栏 figure，caption 说明：(a) drifting features 的 Cohen's d 随 depth 单调递增（|d|>1），(b) near-stationary features 保持在 |d|<0.25 范围

### 4. 新增 Transfer Heatmap 图
- 文件已存在：fig_transfer_heatmap.pdf
- 插入到 Results 的 classification/generalization 相关段落附近
- 单栏 figure，caption 说明：8×8 cross-generator binary F1 transfer matrix，mean cross-gen F1=0.810 [95% CI: 0.796, 0.822]，对角线高（within-generator）、off-diagonal 均匀高（cross-generator transfer 强）

### 5. 引用更新
- 所有 `\ref{fig:framework}` 替换——如果上下文是描述方法，改为 inline 文字；如果指向图，改为指向新的 Figure 1 或删除
- 确保所有新增图的 label 被正文引用

### 6. 页面预算
- 删除框架图（figure*）约省 0.3 页
- 新增 2 张单栏图约占 0.5 页
- 净增 ~0.2 页，在 8 页限制内
- 如果超页，优先压缩 figure 的 width（如 0.9\columnwidth）或调整 caption 简洁度

### 7. 注意图的排版位置
- 用户规则："图片要放在文中出现的地方附近"，"前面有留白时，调整后面的文字和图片及时向上补齐"
- 用 [t!] 或 [!t] 放在段落附近，避免大量空白

```text
This is a significant restructuring task. Let me plan carefully:

1. Delete the framework figure from introduction.tex (lines 13-18)
2. Handle all references to fig:framework
3. Move DDR strip plot (fig:feature-drift) to Introduction as Figure 1
4. Add convergence dynamics figure to Results
5. Add transfer heatmap figure to Results
6. Compile and verify page count

Let me first check that the figure files exist, then read the relevant sections more carefully.

1	\section{Introduction}
2	\label{sec:introduction}
3	
4	An estimated 7--17\% of recent scientific publications already contain substantial LLM-modified content \cite{mapping_llm_science,monitoring_ai_review}. As these outputs re-enter training corpora \cite{dolma,fineweb} and seed further generation, text accumulates at varying \emph{generation depths}; each successive cycle reshapes distributional properties in ways that matter for data provenance, corpus auditing, and contamination monitoring in base-model pretraining corpora \cite{ccnet,dsir} as well as model collapse analysis \cite{curse_of_recursion,strong_model_collapse}. Understanding \emph{how} recursive generation alters text distributions---and which properties change versus which are preserved---is therefore a prerequisite for principled corpus curation, yet current methods address only binary human-or-machine detection \cite{detectgpt,fast_detectgpt,binoculars,ld_score}.
5	Base models provide the cleanest substrate to isolate depth effects from alignment-induced changes.
6	We find that recursive generation produces a decomposable depth profile: distributional \emph{location} drifts with depth while \emph{shape} remains stable across generators, an asymmetry sufficient for cross-generator depth prediction.
7	
8	Distributional compression under recursive generation is well-documented \cite{curious_decline,broken_telephone,markovian_chains}, yet existing analyses characterize \emph{that} and \emph{why} convergence occurs without decomposing what drifts from what is preserved.
9	We introduce \emph{depth profiling} (coarse ordinal classification into gen-0\,/\,gen-1\,/\,gen-2+; Figure~\ref{fig:framework}), and decompose this compression into structurally distinct components: across eight base-model generators spanning five architectural families (0.6B--8B), the NLL distribution's central tendency (mean entropy (reference-model NLL), lexical diversity) drifts monotonically with depth while its shape (entropy extremes, tail structure) remains an order of magnitude more stable (effect size $d{=}0.76$--$1.17$ vs.\ $d < 0.10$ for three near-stationary features; entropy std is intermediate ($d{=}0.55$); boundary features show additional nuance; convergent effect-size measures confirm this partition).
10	We term this location/shape asymmetry the \emph{differential depth response} (DDR; Figure~\ref{fig:ddr-trajectory}), an empirical regularity of base-model autoregressive generation that is mechanistically distinct from model collapse \cite{curse_of_recursion}, which erodes tail coverage via weight updates; DDR instead analyzes fixed-parameter inference chains.
11	The stationary shape component complements location drift for depth prediction without per-generator calibration.
12

15	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{fig2_framework.pdf}
16	\caption{Depth profiling framework. (a)~Recursive generation chain: a human-written seed (gen-0) is iteratively fed through a generator $G$ to produce text at successive depths; eight base-model LLMs across five families (0.6B--8B) serve as generators. (b)~Feature extraction: each text is scored by a fixed reference model (Pythia-410M), yielding five NLL statistics and two surface diversity measures (seven DDR features total). (c)~Leave-One-Generator-Out evaluation: XGBoost classifies each text into gen-0\,/\,gen-1\,/\,gen-2+ with one generator held out per fold.}
17	\label{fig:framework}
18	\end{figure*}
19	We focus on base (pretrained) models; instruction tuning degrades depth signal (Appendix~\ref{app:instruct}).
20	
21	As a proof of concept, a lightweight 7-feature ensemble informed by DDR achieves leak-free binary F1\,=\,0.694 under leave-one-generator-out evaluation, matching multi-detector ensembles at ${\sim}2.4\times$ lower cost; an end-to-end QLoRA classifier reaches 3-class F1\,=\,0.905 (6-gen LOGO; Appendix~\ref{app:qlora}), confirming that the depth signal extends well beyond handcrafted features.
22	
23	Our contributions:
24	\begin{enumerate}[nosep,leftmargin=*]
25	    \item \textbf{Empirical decomposition (DDR).} Across eight generators from five families, we decompose inference-chain drift into two primary response zones---drifting ($d{=}0.76$--$1.17$) vs.\ near-stationary ($d < 0.10$)---plus one intermediate feature ($d{=}0.55$). Where prior work documents \emph{what converges} \cite{curious_decline,markovian_chains}, DDR identifies \emph{what is approximately preserved}, an empirical regularity with analytical utility for depth classification without per-generator calibration. DDR is a descriptive empirical finding; the classification value lies in this decomposition rather than the classifier itself.
26	    \item \textbf{Task formulation and evaluation suite.} We define generation depth classification as an ordinal prediction task and construct a controlled dataset of 37K texts from eight generators across five families (0.6B--8B; exploratory evidence extends to 14B, Appendix~\ref{app:9gen-scale}), with leave-one-generator-out cross-validation as the primary evaluation protocol.
27	    \item \textbf{Scope characterization.} Systematic evaluation across temperature, prompt type, instruction tuning, model scale, domain transfer, and perturbation robustness maps the operational envelope of depth profiling.

Colored lines: individual generators; diamonds: cross-generator mean (blue for drifting, amber for stationary). This dichotomy defines the DDR.}
10	\label{fig:ddr-trajectory}
11	\end{figure*}
12	
13	\subsection{Depth Classification Performance}
14	\label{sec:results-classification}
15	
16	The 7-feature ensemble achieves 3-class LOGO F1\,=\,0.762 (95\% CI [0.758, 0.766]; $N$\,=\,37{,}058) across eight generators from five families (Table~\ref{tab:logo-results}), with cross-generator F1 spread of 9.1\,pp capturing generator selection uncertainty.
17	This 3-class metric is inflated by shared gen-0 seeds across generators (per-class gen-0 F1\,$\approx$\,0.94; \S\ref{sec:generation}); we therefore report \textbf{leak-free binary F1} (gen-1 vs.\ gen-2+, our primary conservative metric)\,=\,0.694 (CI [0.688, 0.700]; generator-level mean${\pm}$SE: $0.694{\pm}0.010$) throughout, excluding gen-0 entirely.
18	Per-generator binary F1 ranges from 0.633 (Mistral-7B) to 0.724 (Pythia-2.8B; SD\,=\,0.028), with the primary difficulty at the gen-1\,/\,gen-2+ boundary (Appendix~\ref{app:confusion}).
19	
20	\paragraph{Cross-model generalization.}
21	Cross-model chains (randomly selected generator per step) yield binary F1\,=\,0.830 (95\% CI [.818, .841]; Appendix~\ref{app:cross-model-detail}) under 5-generator LOGO.\footnote{Pythia-2.8B/1B, OLMo-2-1B, Qwen3-0.6B/1.7B; generator-level LOGO with bootstrap CIs ($n$\,=\,1{,}000). Not directly comparable to 8-generator LOGO due to differing subsets.}
22	Single-generator transfer (Appendix~\ref{app:transfer}) confirms the signal is not a mixed-chain artifact (mean transfer F1\,=\,0.810; LOFO\,=\,0.686); the cross-model advantage is only 2\,pp; ANOVA variance decomposition confirms generator identity contributes ${<}1$\% of feature variance ($\eta^2_{\text{gen}} \leq 0.009$; Appendix~\ref{app:cross-model-detail}).
23	A scale effect emerges: smaller models achieve higher F1 (Pythia-2.8B: 0.724 vs.\ Mistral-7B: 0.633), partly reflecting same-family affinity with the Pythia-410M reference (spread $\leq$0.013; \S\ref{sec:results-differential}).
24	An end-to-end QLoRA classifier reaches 3-class F1\,=\,0.905 ($+$11.6\,pp; Appendix~\ref{app:qlora}), confirming additional depth signal in token-level representations; on instruct data, QLoRA recovers to 0.89--0.91 (Appendix~\ref{app:instruct}), establishing the decomposition as DDR's primary contribution.
25	
26	\paragraph{Confound controls.}
27	Length-matched subsampling yields binary F1\,=\,0.724 (vs.\ 0.770; Appendix~\ref{app:length}); independent-seed evaluation with disjoint pools (F1\,=\,0.680; Appendix~\ref{app:seed-control}) confirms the classifier captures generative degradation, not seed-specific content.

32	\caption{8-generator LOGO macro-F1 for the 7-feature ensemble (bootstrap 95\% CIs, $n$\,=\,1000).

Cross-generator binary F1: SD\,=\,0.028, IQR\,=\,[0.692, 0.714]. $^{\dagger}$3-class F1 carries upward bias because gen-0 seeds are shared across generators (\S\ref{sec:generation}); independent-seed controls confirm the depth signal (F1\,=\,0.680; Appendix~\ref{app:seed-control}).

61	\caption{LOGO binary F1 vs.\ inference cost in ms/text (8-gen pooled). The 7-feature ensemble (one 410M reference model) matches multi-detector ensembles (two models, 1.4B total) at ${\sim}2.4\times$ lower cost; individual detectors vary widely when repurposed for depth. Inference costs measured on a single NVIDIA RTX 5090.}
62	\label{fig:baseline-ci}
63	\end{figure}
64	
65	\paragraph{Formal definition.}
66	For feature $f$ measured across depths $d \in \{0,1,2{+}\}$, we define its \emph{depth sensitivity} as $\text{DDR}(f) = |\rho(\text{depth}, f)|$, where $\rho$ is Spearman correlation over all per-text measurements.
67	A feature is classified as \emph{drifting} if Cohen's $d > 0.50$ between adjacent depths, or \emph{stationary} if $d < 0.15$; these thresholds are reference anchors, not definitive boundaries---the two-cluster structure is robust across $\varepsilon \in [0.10, 0.75]$, supported by unsupervised $k$-means (silhouette\,=\,0.660, $p{=}0.030$), exhaustive enumeration of all 35 splits (this partition ranks first), and independent replication in all eight generators (Appendix~\ref{app:ddr-validation}); crucially, each generator's data is fully independent, making per-generator split analysis an 8-fold independent validation of the partition rather than same-data circularity.
68	Recursive inputs grow increasingly self-typical~\citep{markovian_chains}, predicting location drift with shape invariance (confirmed across nucleus, greedy, and top-$k$ strategies; Appendix~\ref{app:decoding-strategy}).
69	
70	Figure~\ref{fig:ddr-trajectory} reveals the dichotomy: central-tendency features (entropy mean, TTR, hapax ratio) decline monotonically with depth, while shape features (entropy max, tail decay, entropy min) remain flat.
71	The partition is binary ($k{=}2$; silhouette\,=\,0.660), with entropy std as a sole \emph{intermediate} member ($d{=}0.55$, $|\rho|{=}0.16$), distinct from three near-stationary features ($d < 0.10$; Appendix~\ref{app:ddr-validation}).

76	\caption{Differential depth response (DDR). Diamonds: cross-generator means; dots: per-generator values. Drifting features (blue; $|\rho| > 0.60$, $d{=}0.76$--$1.17$) show strong monotonic depth sensitivity; non-drifting features remain stable. Entropy std (reference-model NLL; wine; $d{=}0.55$) is intermediate; near-stationary features (amber; $d \leq 0.10$) show negligible drift. Marker shapes encode feature identity for grayscale accessibility.}
77	\label{fig:feature-drift}
78	\end{figure}
79	
80	Pooled Spearman correlations corroborate the split: drifting features show $|\rho| > 0.60$ (hapax ratio $-0.64$, TTR $-0.63$, entropy mean $-0.60$) vs.\ $|\rho| \leq 0.16$ for non-drifting---a six-fold magnitude gap defining the DDR partition (Figure~\ref{fig:feature-drift}).
81	
82	\paragraph{Quantification.}
83	Cohen's $d$ \cite{cohen1988statistical} shows a ${\geq}7{\times}$ gap between drifting ($d{=}0.76$--$1.17$) and near-stationary ($d \leq 0.08$); KS, Glass's $\Delta$, Cliff's $\delta$ all corroborate (Appendix~\ref{app:ddr-validation}).
84	Entropy min and tail decay are \emph{boundary features}: entropy min is near-stationary for gen-1/gen-2+ ($d{=}0.016$) but sensitive at gen-0/gen-1; tail decay passes TOST for only 4/8 generators ($|d|{=}0.10$--$0.22$).
85	\paragraph{Validation.}
86	Each hold-out generator independently recovers the identical partition (silhouette 0.505--0.760; Appendix~\ref{app:ddr-validation}); TOST confirms near-stationarity for entropy min (8/8) and entropy max (6/8); permutation testing confirms the split as non-random ($p{=}0.030$); $\Delta|\rho| \leq 0.05$ across splits; disjoint generator-pool splits, heteroscedasticity robustness, and per-feature convergence dynamics appear in Appendices~\ref{app:holdout-split}--\ref{app:convergence}.
87	
88	\paragraph{Feature complementarity.}
89	The full 7-feature set (F1\,=\,0.773, 10-fold stratified CV, complementing the LOGO protocol in Table~\ref{tab:logo-results}) outperforms surface-only (0.688) and reference-only (0.713; McNemar $p \approx 0$; Appendix~\ref{app:ablation-table}).
90	The collinear drifting triplet captures ${\sim}$1 effective dimension (PCA PC1\,=\,92.3\%; Appendix~\ref{sec:appendix-feature-correlation}); group ablation confirms complementarity for depth profiling: 3-class F1 gains $+$5.3\,pp when non-drifting features are added (drifting-only 0.716, all-7 0.769), while binary detection is already saturated by location drift alone (drifting-only binary F1\,=\,0.697 vs.\ all-7\,=\,0.700; Appendix~\ref{app:ablation-table})---shape stability contributes to depth \emph{grading}, not detection.
91	TTR and hapax ratio ($r = 0.97$) are retained for marginal LOFO gains \cite{strobl_conditional_2008} (Appendix~\ref{app:lofo}).
92	
93	\paragraph{Cross-family reference models.}
94	Alternative references (OLMo-2-1B, Qwen3-0.6B) yield F1 spread of only 0.013 (Appendix~\ref{app:cross-ref}); same-family proximity may inflate Pythia F1 by up to 1.3\,pp, but the DDR partition is preserved.
95	
96	\paragraph{Temperature and prompt-type sensitivity.}
97	All four tested generators degrade at $t{=}0.9$ ($-$9.3 to $-$26.0\,pp binary F1; Appendix~\ref{app:sampling-sensitivity}); continuation chains show the strongest drift (F1\,=\,0.781; Appendix~\ref{app:prompt-type}).
98	The DDR partition hierarchy is preserved across temperatures (Appendix~\ref{app:ddr-temp-stability}).

102	\subsection{Comparison with Detection Baselines}
103	\label{sec:results-baselines}
104	
105	We next ask whether existing detection methods---designed for binary real-vs-synthetic classification---incidentally capture depth structure, repurposing four detection scores as ordinal depth predictors under identical XGBoost and LOGO conditions (Table~\ref{tab:baselines}).
106	The strongest baseline is a 4-detector + surface feature ensemble (binary F1\,=\,0.708), which pools four detection scores with TTR and hapax ratio; among individual detectors, Avg-LogProb provides the most meaningful single-feature comparison.
107	
108	\begin{table}[t]
109	\centering
110	\footnotesize
111	\caption{Depth classification (8-gen LOGO, pooled evaluation; pooled F1 is slightly higher than per-generator macro F1 in Table~\ref{tab:logo-results} because larger test folds from high-performing generators contribute proportionally more). Identical XGBoost configuration. 7-feature: one 410M model (905\,MB); 4-det ensembles: two models, 1.4B params (2{,}868\,MB). Individual detection scores (N/A) share the reference-model forward pass; per-method timing is not separately profiled. XGBoost uses 7 handcrafted scalar features (one 410M reference); QLoRA (\S\ref{sec:results-classification}) uses the full token sequence---an information-asymmetric ceiling, not a fair comparison.}

127	\end{tabular}}
128	\end{table}
129	
130	The 7-feature ensemble matches the 4-detector+surface ensemble on binary F1 (0.705 vs.\ 0.708; Figure~\ref{fig:baseline-ci}) at ${\sim}2.4\times$ lower cost, though the latter leads by 2.1\,pp on 3-class F1 (0.795 vs.\ 0.774); both surpass individual detectors by 3.0--16.6\,pp.
131	DDR's contribution is the decomposition into location-sensitive and shape-stable components (\S\ref{sec:discussion}), achieving comparable depth discrimination with a single 410M reference model; ordinal-specific methods (CORAL, Frank-Hall) yield comparable F1 (Appendix~\ref{app:classifier}).
132	Concurrent iterative-generation studies use different chain operators (back-translation, rephrasing) and target different phenomena (factuality, convergence dynamics), precluding direct inclusion as depth classification baselines (Appendix~\ref{app:iterative-comparison}).

```text
Good. `fig:framework` is only referenced in introduction.tex (line 9) and the label definition (line 17). `fig:feature-drift` is referenced in results.tex (line 80 and the label on line 77).

Now let me plan all the changes:

1. **Delete framework figure** from introduction.tex (lines 13-18)
2. **Replace `Figure~\ref{fig:framework}` reference** on line 9 — integrate method description inline
3. **Move DDR strip plot** from results.tex (lines 73-78) to introduction.tex (where framework was)


4. **Update reference** in results.tex line 80 — `Figure~\ref{fig:feature-drift}` still works since the label moves with the figure
5. **Add convergence dynamics figure** near §4.2 validation paragraph
6. **Add transfer heatmap figure** near §4.1 cross-model generalization paragraph

For placement, I'll put the DDR strip plot after line 11 in introduction as a single-column figure—that makes it Figure 1. The DDR trajectory figure in results becomes Figure 2. The convergence dynamics figure goes near the validation paragraph around line 85, and the transfer heatmap sits near the cross-model generalization discussion in §4.1.

Now I'm executing the edits: replacing the framework figure in introduction.tex with the DDR strip plot, removing the DDR plot from results.tex, updating the framework reference, and adding both the convergence dynamics and transfer heatmap figures to results.tex. I need to be careful with the introduction.tex edit around line 9 where the depth profiling text is.

Writing LaTeX figure code... I'm refining the figure caption to make it punchier as the main finding—emphasizing how the differential depth response pattern across feature types is what enables depth classification without needing generator-specific tuning. Now moving on to the transfer heatmap visualization.

I'll insert the transfer matrix figure after the cross-model generalization section to show that the depth signal generalizes robustly across generators, with the high off-diagonal F1 scores demonstrating this transfer works without calibration. Then I'm placing the convergence dynamics figure near the validation section to round out the empirical evidence.

Now I need to weave references to both figures into the text—linking the transfer heatmap to the cross-model discussion and the convergence plot to the stability findings.

I'm planning the specific edits: removing the framework figure from the introduction and replacing it with the DDR strip plot, then deleting the duplicate DDR plot from results while adding the two new figures with their inline citations in the appropriate sections.

Now I need to reconsider the figure ordering more carefully. The DDR strip plot moves to the introduction as Figure 1, the full-width DDR trajectory stays at the top of results as Figure 2, and I need to decide whether the transfer heatmap or baseline comparison should come next depending on where they'll actually land in the compiled layout. The transfer heatmap belongs near the cross-model discussion, so I'm thinking through the best placement for that. Now I'm deciding where to insert the figure references in the text—I'll add the transfer heatmap citation right after the mean transfer F1 value on line 22, and modify line 86 to include a reference to the convergence dynamics figure within the existing appendix citation. I need to be mindful of how figures float in the two-column layout, so I'll position the transfer heatmap after the cross-model paragraph to ensure proper placement, then batch these edits together.

For the introduction file, I'm removing the framework figure reference from line 9 and replacing the figure environment on lines 13-18 with the DDR strip plot instead. Writing figure caption... to edit. I need to remove that figure entirely, then add the transfer heatmap reference and statistics after line 22, making sure to insert the figure itself right after that paragraph. For the convergence dynamics section, I'm planning to add more content there as well. I'm deciding where to insert the transfer heatmap figure—it should go after the scale effect paragraph to keep related results together, then before the QLoRA discussion starts. For the convergence figure, I'll add the reference inline where it's mentioned in the appendix callout. I'm reconsidering the figure placement strategy given the page constraints the Director mentioned. The transfer heatmap belongs near the cross-model generalization discussion, and the convergence dynamics figure should go after the validation section. I'll use LaTeX's [t] placement and trust it to handle the positioning, but I need to be mindful about the overall page budget since the Director wants to showcase experimental work while keeping the paper concise.

Understanding \\emph{how} recursive generation alters text distributions---and which properties change versus which are preserved---is therefore a prerequisite for principled corpus curation, yet current methods address only binary human-or-machine detection \\cite{detectgpt,fast_detectgpt,binoculars,ld_score}.\nBase models provide the cleanest substrate to isolate depth effects from alignment-induced changes.\nWe find that recursive generation produces a decomposable depth profile: distributional \\emph{location} drifts with depth while \\emph{shape} remains stable across generators, an asymmetry sufficient for cross-generator depth prediction.\n\nDistributional compression under recursive generation is well-documented \\cite{curious_decline,broken_telephone,markovian_chains}, yet existing analyses characterize \\emph{that} and \\emph{why} convergence occurs without decomposing what drifts from what is preserved.\nWe introduce \\emph{depth profiling} (coarse ordinal classification into gen-0\\,/\\,gen-1\\,/\\,gen-2+), and decompose this compression into structurally distinct components: across eight base-model generators spanning five architectural families (0.6B--8B), the NLL distribution's central tendency (mean entropy (reference-model NLL), lexical diversity) drifts monotonically with depth while its shape (entropy extremes, tail structure) remains an order of magnitude more stable (effect size $d{=}0.76$--$1.17$ vs.\\ $d < 0.10$ for three near-stationary features; entropy std is intermediate ($d{=}0.55$); boundary features show additional nuance; convergent effect-size measures confirm this partition).\nWe term this location/shape asymmetry the \\emph{differential depth response} (DDR; Figure~\\ref{fig:ddr-trajectory}), an empirical regularity of base-model autoregressive generation that is mechanistically distinct from model collapse \\cite{curse_of_recursion}, which erodes tail coverage via weight updates; DDR instead analyzes fixed-parameter inference chains.\nThe stationary shape component complements location drift for depth prediction without per-generator calibration.\n\n\\begin{figure*}[t!]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{fig2_framework.pdf}\n\\caption{Depth profiling framework.

Understanding \\emph{how} recursive generation alters text distributions---and which properties change versus which are preserved---is therefore a prerequisite for principled corpus curation, yet current methods address only binary human-or-machine detection \\cite{detectgpt,fast_detectgpt,binoculars,ld_score}.\nBase models provide the cleanest substrate to isolate depth effects from alignment-induced changes.\nWe find that recursive generation produces a decomposable depth profile: distributional \\emph{location} drifts with depth while \\emph{shape} remains stable across generators, an asymmetry sufficient for cross-generator depth prediction.\n\nDistributional compression under recursive generation is well-documented \\cite{curious_decline,broken_telephone,markovian_chains}, yet existing analyses characterize \\emph{that} and \\emph{why} convergence occurs without decomposing what drifts from what is preserved.\nWe introduce \\emph{depth profiling} (coarse ordinal classification into gen-0\\,/\\,gen-1\\,/\\,gen-2+; Figure~\\ref{fig:framework}), and decompose this compression into structurally distinct components: across eight base-model generators spanning five architectural families (0.6B--8B), the NLL distribution's central tendency (mean entropy (reference-model NLL), lexical diversity) drifts monotonically with depth while its shape (entropy extremes, tail structure) remains an order of magnitude more stable (effect size $d{=}0.76$--$1.17$ vs.\\ $d < 0.10$ for three near-stationary features; entropy std is intermediate ($d{=}0.55$); boundary features show additional nuance; convergent effect-size measures confirm this partition).\nWe term this location/shape asymmetry the \\emph{differential depth response} (DDR; Figure~\\ref{fig:ddr-trajectory}), an empirical regularity of base-model autoregressive generation that is mechanistically distinct from model collapse \\cite{curse_of_recursion}, which erodes tail coverage via weight updates; DDR instead analyzes fixed-parameter inference chains.\nThe stationary shape component complements location drift for depth prediction without per-generator calibration.\n\n\\begin{figure*}[t!]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{fig2_framework.pdf}\n\\caption{Depth profiling framework.

Let me check the details:

- 37 pages total
- 0 undefined references (grep returned nothing)
- Figure 1: DDR strip plot (in introduction) ✓ — visible on page 2
- Figure 2: DDR trajectories (ddr_trajectory) — visible on page 6
- Figure 3: Transfer heatmap — visible on page 7
- Figure 4: Baseline comparison — visible on page 7
- Discussion and Conclusion on page 8 ✓
- Limitations and References on page 9

Wait, I don't see the convergence dynamics figure listed. 

I need to track down where the convergence dynamics figure ended up—it might be Figure 5 or it could have floated to a different page. Let me look more carefully at pages 7 through 9 to see if it's positioned after the validation section or if it got pushed further back in the document. I'm realizing the convergence figure might have been pushed to a float page at the end since there wasn't space for it in the main text columns. The key constraint is that the main text itself stays within 8 pages, with Discussion and Conclusion wrapping up on page 8.

All 5 figures placed correctly:
- Figure 1: DDR strip plot (page 2, introduction) ✓
- Figure 2: DDR trajectories (page 6, results §4.2) ✓
- Figure 3: Transfer heatmap (page 7, results §4.1) ✓
- Figure 4: Baseline comparison (page 7, results §4.2/§4.3) ✓
- Figure 5: Convergence dynamics (page 7, results §4.2) ✓

But wait — page 8 has Discussion and Conclusion, and page 9 starts with "depth profiling as a candidate audit dimension for pretraining pipelines." which seems to be continuation of Conclusion, then Limitations. 

I need to verify whether the main text actually stays within 8 pages. Looking at page 9, that opening line about depth profiling sounds like it's coming from the Conclusion section, which means the Conclusion is spilling across the page break.

Let me trace through the actual conclusion text to see where "pretraining pipelines" appears. The conclusion I found earlier mentions "pretraining data auditing" but not "pretraining pipelines" specifically. That phrasing might be coming from the Discussion section instead. I should re-examine both sections to figure out exactly where the page break is occurring. I'm searching through the document to verify where specific phrases appear and whether there's a page overflow issue affecting the layout of the conclusion section.

I see the problem. The Conclusion text is spilling from page 8 to page 9. The last lines on page 8 are:

"cross-generator depth classification within the studied base-model scope (F1 = 0.694–0.762); initial QLoRA recovery (F1 = 0.89–0.91) points to tractable instruct-model adaptation. At corpus scale, batch contamination estimation reaches ±3–4% at n=1,000 (Appendix l), suggesting"

And the first lines on page 9 are:

"depth profiling as a candidate audit dimension for pretraining pipelines."
 
But I'm noticing a discrepancy—the text I'm seeing in the PDF doesn't match what I expected from the source. The PDF shows "initial QLoRA recovery" and mentions "instruct-model adaptation," but the original text I have references "extending to instruct models remains open" instead. The formatting also differs, with the PDF using plain text while the source has LaTeX notation.

Let me check if the conclusion.tex file was updated in a recent revision.

The conclusion text has been updated to include "initial QLoRA recovery" and "depth profiling as a candidate audit dimension for pretraining pipelines" — this is slightly different from what I remembered. It seems like it was updated in a previous round.

The problem is that Conclusion's last sentence ("suggesting depth profiling as a candidate audit dimension for pretraining pipelines.") is spilling onto page 9. This means the main text exceeds 8 pages by a couple of lines.

I need to fix this. Options:
1. Shorten the conclusion text
2. Add vspace compression


3. Shorten something on page 8

Looking at page 8, it contains Table 3 with the baselines, the baseline comparison text, Discussion, and Conclusion. The new figures on pages 5-7 pushed everything down, which is why the Conclusion is overflowing. I could use \enlargethispage to recover space, but that was removed earlier. Instead, I should add more vspace compression in the Discussion or Conclusion sections, or trim the conclusion by a line.

Actually, the overflow is minimal—just one line fragment about depth profiling spilling onto page 9. Let me check where exactly the Conclusion ends. The main text exceeds 8 pages by about 1.5 lines, so I need to compress the conclusion slightly. I can tighten the second sentence about batch contamination estimation to recover that space. I'm considering whether to compress the Discussion section's vertical spacing from -2mm to -3mm, or combine that with shortening the conclusion text. Since the overflow is about 1.5 lines (roughly 5mm), just increasing the vspace by 1mm won't be enough on its own. I should look at other compression opportunities, like the lengthy caption on Table 3, though I need to be careful about what I modify.

Now I'm weighing two main approaches: using \enlargethispage to add breathing room to page 8, or shortening the conclusion itself. The \enlargethispage command would work for this minimal overflow but feels like a workaround. Alternatively, I could trim the conclusion to focus on the key findings about recursive generation and the QLoRA recovery results, cutting it down significantly. I'm working through spacing adjustments to fit the paper better. Increasing the Discussion section's negative vspace from -2mm to -3mm at both top and bottom should recover about a line, and I can tighten the Conclusion by merging sentences more efficiently—combining the depth classification results with the batch contamination findings into a single flowing statement rather than keeping them separate. I'm verifying the character count on this revision—the shortened version drops the phrase about base-model scope and consolidates the QLoRA metrics, then moves straight to the contamination estimate and its implications for audit methodology. I've saved about 65 characters total—roughly a line of space—so combined with tightening the Discussion section's vertical spacing, that should be sufficient. Now I'm adjusting the Conclusion's spacing as well to match, then applying all these changes.

[Director 指令] [Patch] 用户要求两项修改，优先级高：

**任务 1：最重要的结果图放到最前面**

用户原话："要把最重要的结果图放到最前面，不一定是文中提到的，这很关键"

当前正文 5 张图的顺序：
- Figure 1 (P2, Intro): DDR strip plot — 展示 DDR 模式发现
- Figure 2 (P6, §4.2): DDR trajectory — 7 特征趋势线
- Figure 3 (P7, §4.1): Transfer heatmap — 8×8 跨 generator F1 矩阵
- Figure 4 (P7, §4.3): Baseline comparison — F1 vs cost
- Figure 5 (P7, §4.2): Convergence dynamics — Cohen's d

评估哪张图是"最重要的结果图"——不是最重要的"发现"或"模式"，而是最能证明方法 WORKS 的结果图。考虑候选：
- Transfer heatmap（8×8 F1 矩阵，一眼看出跨 generator 泛化能力，信息密度极高）
- Baseline comparison（直接对比竞品）
- Convergence dynamics（effect size 递增，统计说服力强）

如果评估后认为当前 Figure 1（DDR strip plot）不是最重要的结果图，把最重要的结果图提到 Figure 1 位置（Intro 部分/page 1-2），原 Figure 1 顺延。图的 LaTeX 浮动位置要调到尽可能靠前（[t] 在早期页面），不需要跟着文字段落走。

**任务 2：附录去重**

用户原话："附录中内容注意别和正文重复"

已知潜在重复：
- 附录 Figure 6（violin plots，7 个特征分布）与正文 Figure 2（DDR trajectory，同 7 个特征趋势线）——两者展示同一组特征在不同 depth 的分布，信息高度重叠
- 检查附录所有 section 的文字是否有与正文重复的段落/结论（特别是 Appendix b Length Confound vs 正文 §3.4，Appendix c Prompt Type vs 正文 §4.1）

处理方式：
- 对于重复的图：如果附录的 violin plot 信息量比正文的 trajectory plot 更丰富（展示完整分布而非均值），考虑保留附录图但修改 caption 强调差异化信息（如"full distribution"而非趋势）。如果信息完全冗余则删除
- 对于重复的文字：附录应该提供正文没有的补充细节，而非重述正文已有的结论。删除重复的总结性语句，保留正文中没有提到的具体数据/分析

编译后确认正文 ≤8 页，0 critical warnings。这次不用验证引用。

4	An estimated 7--17\% of recent scientific publications already contain substantial LLM-modified content \cite{mapping_llm_science,monitoring_ai_review}. As these outputs re-enter training corpora \cite{dolma,fineweb} and seed further generation, text accumulates at varying \emph{generation depths}; each successive cycle reshapes distributional properties in ways that matter for data provenance, corpus auditing, and contamination monitoring in base-model pretraining corpora \cite{ccnet,dsir} as well as model collapse analysis \cite{curse_of_recursion,strong_model_collapse}. Understanding \emph{how} recursive generation alters text distributions---and which properties change versus which are preserved---is therefore a prerequisite for principled corpus curation, yet current methods address only binary human-or-machine detection \cite{detectgpt,fast_detectgpt,binoculars,ld_score}.
5	Base models provide the cleanest substrate to isolate depth effects from alignment-induced changes.
6	We find that recursive generation produces a decomposable depth profile: distributional \emph{location} drifts with depth while \emph{shape} remains stable across generators, an asymmetry sufficient for cross-generator depth prediction.
7	
8	Distributional compression under recursive generation is well-documented \cite{curious_decline,broken_telephone,markovian_chains}, yet existing analyses characterize \emph{that} and \emph{why} convergence occurs without decomposing what drifts from what is preserved.
9	We introduce \emph{depth profiling} (coarse ordinal classification into gen-0\,/\,gen-1\,/\,gen-2+), and decompose this compression into structurally distinct components: across eight base-model generators spanning five architectural families (0.6B--8B), the NLL distribution's central tendency (mean entropy (reference-model NLL), lexical diversity) drifts monotonically with depth while its shape (entropy extremes, tail structure) remains an order of magnitude more stable (effect size $d{=}0.76$--$1.17$ vs.\ $d < 0.10$ for three near-stationary features; entropy std is intermediate ($d{=}0.55$); boundary features show additional nuance; convergent effect-size measures confirm this partition).
10	We term this location/shape asymmetry the \emph{differential depth response} (DDR; Figure~\ref{fig:ddr-trajectory}), an empirical regularity of base-model autoregressive generation that is mechanistically distinct from model collapse \cite{curse_of_recursion}, which erodes tail coverage via weight updates; DDR instead analyzes fixed-parameter inference chains.
11	The stationary shape component complements location drift for depth prediction without per-generator calibration.

This location/shape asymmetry---the paper's central finding---complements location drift for depth classification without per-generator calibration.}
17	\label{fig:feature-drift}
18	\end{figure}
19	We focus on base (pretrained) models; instruction tuning degrades depth signal (Appendix~\ref{app:instruct}).
20	
21	As a proof of concept, a lightweight 7-feature ensemble informed by DDR achieves leak-free binary F1\,=\,0.694 under leave-one-generator-out evaluation, matching multi-detector ensembles at ${\sim}2.4\times$ lower cost; an end-to-end QLoRA classifier reaches 3-class F1\,=\,0.905 (6-gen LOGO; Appendix~\ref{app:qlora}), confirming that the depth signal extends well beyond handcrafted features.
22	
23	Our contributions:
24	\begin{enumerate}[nosep,leftmargin=*]
25	    \item \textbf{Empirical decomposition (DDR).} Across eight generators from five families, we decompose inference-chain drift into two primary response zones---drifting ($d{=}0.76$--$1.17$) vs.\ near-stationary ($d < 0.10$)---plus one intermediate feature ($d{=}0.55$). Where prior work documents \emph{what converges} \cite{curious_decline,markovian_chains}, DDR identifies \emph{what is approximately preserved}, an empirical regularity with analytical utility for depth classification without per-generator calibration. DDR is a descriptive empirical finding; the classification value lies in this decomposition rather than the classifier itself.
26	    \item \textbf{Task formulation and evaluation suite.} We define generation depth classification as an ordinal prediction task and construct a controlled dataset of 37K texts from eight generators across five families (0.6B--8B; exploratory evidence extends to 14B, Appendix~\ref{app:9gen-scale}), with leave-one-generator-out cross-validation as the primary evaluation protocol.
27	    \item \textbf{Scope characterization.} Systematic evaluation across temperature, prompt type, instruction tuning, model scale, domain transfer, and perturbation robustness maps the operational envelope of depth profiling.

Colored lines: individual generators; diamonds: cross-generator mean (blue for drifting, amber for stationary). This dichotomy defines the DDR.}

11	\end{figure*}
12	
13	\subsection{Depth Classification Performance}
14	\label{sec:results-classification}
15	
16	The 7-feature ensemble achieves 3-class LOGO F1\,=\,0.762 (95\% CI [0.758, 0.766]; $N$\,=\,37{,}058) across eight generators from five families (Table~\ref{tab:logo-results}), with cross-generator F1 spread of 9.1\,pp capturing generator selection uncertainty.
17	This 3-class metric is inflated by shared gen-0 seeds across generators (per-class gen-0 F1\,$\approx$\,0.94; \S\ref{sec:generation}); we therefore report \textbf{leak-free binary F1} (gen-1 vs.\ gen-2+, our primary conservative metric)\,=\,0.694 (CI [0.688, 0.700]; generator-level mean${\pm}$SE: $0.694{\pm}0.010$) throughout, excluding gen-0 entirely.
18	Per-generator binary F1 ranges from 0.633 (Mistral-7B) to 0.724 (Pythia-2.8B; SD\,=\,0.028), with the primary difficulty at the gen-1\,/\,gen-2+ boundary (Appendix~\ref{app:confusion}).
19	
20	\paragraph{Cross-model generalization.}
21	Cross-model chains (randomly selected generator per step) yield binary F1\,=\,0.830 (95\% CI [.818, .841]; Appendix~\ref{app:cross-model-detail}) under 5-generator LOGO.\footnote{Pythia-2.8B/1B, OLMo-2-1B, Qwen3-0.6B/1.7B; generator-level LOGO with bootstrap CIs ($n$\,=\,1{,}000). Not directly comparable to 8-generator LOGO due to differing subsets.}
22	Single-generator transfer (Appendix~\ref{app:transfer}) confirms the signal is not a mixed-chain artifact (mean transfer F1\,=\,0.810, Figure~\ref{fig:transfer-heatmap}; LOFO\,=\,0.686); the cross-model advantage is only 2\,pp; ANOVA variance decomposition confirms generator identity contributes ${<}1$\% of feature variance ($\eta^2_{\text{gen}} \leq 0.009$; Appendix~\ref{app:cross-model-detail}).
23	A scale effect emerges: smaller models achieve higher F1 (Pythia-2.8B: 0.724 vs.\ Mistral-7B: 0.633), partly reflecting same-family affinity with the Pythia-410M reference (spread $\leq$0.013; \S\ref{sec:results-differential}).
24	An end-to-end QLoRA classifier reaches 3-class F1\,=\,0.905 ($+$11.6\,pp; Appendix~\ref{app:qlora}), confirming additional depth signal in token-level representations; on instruct data, QLoRA recovers to 0.89--0.91 (Appendix~\ref{app:instruct}), establishing the decomposition as DDR's primary contribution.

29	\caption{Cross-generator transfer matrix (binary F1, gen-1 vs.\ gen-2+). Each cell: F1 when training on one generator (row) and testing on another (column). Mean cross-generator F1\,=\,0.810 [95\% CI: 0.796, 0.822]; uniformly high off-diagonal values confirm depth signal transfers across generators without calibration.}
30	\label{fig:transfer-heatmap}
31	\end{figure}
32	
33	\paragraph{Confound controls.}
34	Length-matched subsampling yields binary F1\,=\,0.724 (vs.\ 0.770; Appendix~\ref{app:length}); independent-seed evaluation with disjoint pools (F1\,=\,0.680; Appendix~\ref{app:seed-control}) confirms the classifier captures generative degradation, not seed-specific content.

Cross-generator binary F1: SD\,=\,0.028, IQR\,=\,[0.692, 0.714]. $^{\dagger}$3-class F1 carries upward bias because gen-0 seeds are shared across generators (\S\ref{sec:generation}); independent-seed controls confirm the depth signal (F1\,=\,0.680; Appendix~\ref{app:seed-control}).

67	\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{fig3_baseline_comparison.pdf}
68	\caption{LOGO binary F1 vs.\ inference cost in ms/text (8-gen pooled). The 7-feature ensemble (one 410M reference model) matches multi-detector ensembles (two models, 1.4B total) at ${\sim}2.4\times$ lower cost; individual detectors vary widely when repurposed for depth. Inference costs measured on a single NVIDIA RTX 5090.}
69	\label{fig:baseline-ci}
70	\end{figure}
71	
72	\paragraph{Formal definition.}
73	For feature $f$ measured across depths $d \in \{0,1,2{+}\}$, we define its \emph{depth sensitivity} as $\text{DDR}(f) = |\rho(\text{depth}, f)|$, where $\rho$ is Spearman correlation over all per-text measurements.
74	A feature is classified as \emph{drifting} if Cohen's $d > 0.50$ between adjacent depths, or \emph{stationary} if $d < 0.15$; these thresholds are reference anchors, not definitive boundaries---the two-cluster structure is robust across $\varepsilon \in [0.10, 0.75]$, supported by unsupervised $k$-means (silhouette\,=\,0.660, $p{=}0.030$), exhaustive enumeration of all 35 splits (this partition ranks first), and independent replication in all eight generators (Appendix~\ref{app:ddr-validation}); crucially, each generator's data is fully independent, making per-generator split analysis an 8-fold independent validation of the partition rather than same-data circularity.
75	Recursive inputs grow increasingly self-typical~\citep{markovian_chains}, predicting location drift with shape invariance (confirmed across nucleus, greedy, and top-$k$ strategies; Appendix~\ref{app:decoding-strategy}).
76	
77	Figure~\ref{fig:ddr-trajectory} reveals the dichotomy: central-tendency features (entropy mean, TTR, hapax ratio) decline monotonically with depth, while shape features (entropy max, tail decay, entropy min) remain flat.
78	The partition is binary ($k{=}2$; silhouette\,=\,0.660), with entropy std as a sole \emph{intermediate} member ($d{=}0.55$, $|\rho|{=}0.16$), distinct from three near-stationary features ($d < 0.10$; Appendix~\ref{app:ddr-validation}).
79	
80	Pooled Spearman correlations corroborate the split: drifting features show $|\rho| > 0.60$ (hapax ratio $-0.64$, TTR $-0.63$, entropy mean $-0.60$) vs.\ $|\rho| \leq 0.16$ for non-drifting---a six-fold magnitude gap defining the DDR partition (Figure~\ref{fig:feature-drift}).
81	
82	\paragraph{Quantification.}
83	Cohen's $d$ \cite{cohen1988statistical} shows a ${\geq}7{\times}$ gap between drifting ($d{=}0.76$--$1.17$) and near-stationary ($d \leq 0.08$); KS, Glass's $\Delta$, Cliff's $\delta$ all corroborate (Appendix~\ref{app:ddr-validation}).
84	Entropy min and tail decay are \emph{boundary features}: entropy min is near-stationary for gen-1/gen-2+ ($d{=}0.016$) but sensitive at gen-0/gen-1; tail decay passes TOST for only 4/8 generators ($|d|{=}0.10$--$0.22$).
85	\paragraph{Validation.}
86	Each hold-out generator independently recovers the identical partition (silhouette 0.505--0.760; Appendix~\ref{app:ddr-validation}); TOST confirms near-stationarity for entropy min (8/8) and entropy max (6/8); permutation testing confirms the split as non-random ($p{=}0.030$); $\Delta|\rho| \leq 0.05$ across splits; disjoint generator-pool splits, heteroscedasticity robustness, and per-feature convergence dynamics (Figure~\ref{fig:convergence}) appear in Appendices~\ref{app:holdout-split}--\ref{app:convergence}.
87	
88	\begin{figure}[t]
89	\centering
90	\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{fig_convergence_dynamics.pdf}
91	\caption{Feature convergence dynamics across generation depth. Drifting features (blue) show monotonically increasing effect size ($|d| > 1$ by gen-2+); near-stationary features (amber) remain within $|d| < 0.25$ at all depths, confirming shape stability is not an artifact of insufficient chain length.}
92	\label{fig:convergence}
93	\end{figure}
94	
95	\paragraph{Feature complementarity.}
96	The full 7-feature set (F1\,=\,0.773, 10-fold stratified CV, complementing the LOGO protocol in Table~\ref{tab:logo-results}) outperforms surface-only (0.688) and reference-only (0.713; McNemar $p \approx 0$; Appendix~\ref{app:ablation-table}).
97	The collinear drifting triplet captures ${\sim}$1 effective dimension (PCA PC1\,=\,92.3\%; Appendix~\ref{sec:appendix-feature-correlation}); group ablation confirms complementarity for depth profiling: 3-class F1 gains $+$5.3\,pp when non-drifting features are added (drifting-only 0.716, all-7 0.769), while binary detection is already saturated by location drift alone (drifting-only binary F1\,=\,0.697 vs.\ all-7\,=\,0.700; Appendix~\ref{app:ablation-table})---shape stability contributes to depth \emph{grading}, not detection.
98	TTR and hapax ratio ($r = 0.97$) are retained for marginal LOFO gains \cite{strobl_conditional_2008} (Appendix~\ref{app:lofo}).

100	\paragraph{Cross-family reference models.}
101	Alternative references (OLMo-2-1B, Qwen3-0.6B) yield F1 spread of only 0.013 (Appendix~\ref{app:cross-ref}); same-family proximity may inflate Pythia F1 by up to 1.3\,pp, but the DDR partition is preserved.
102	
103	\paragraph{Temperature and prompt-type sensitivity.}
104	All four tested generators degrade at $t{=}0.9$ ($-$9.3 to $-$26.0\,pp binary F1; Appendix~\ref{app:sampling-sensitivity}); continuation chains show the strongest drift (F1\,=\,0.781; Appendix~\ref{app:prompt-type}).
105	The DDR partition hierarchy is preserved across temperatures (Appendix~\ref{app:ddr-temp-stability}).

109	\subsection{Comparison with Detection Baselines}
110	\label{sec:results-baselines}
111	
112	We next ask whether existing detection methods---designed for binary real-vs-synthetic classification---incidentally capture depth structure, repurposing four detection scores as ordinal depth predictors under identical XGBoost and LOGO conditions (Table~\ref{tab:baselines}).
113	The strongest baseline is a 4-detector + surface feature ensemble (binary F1\,=\,0.708), which pools four detection scores with TTR and hapax ratio; among individual detectors, Avg-LogProb provides the most meaningful single-feature comparison.

118	\caption{Depth classification (8-gen LOGO, pooled evaluation; pooled F1 is slightly higher than per-generator macro F1 in Table~\ref{tab:logo-results} because larger test folds from high-performing generators contribute proportionally more). Identical XGBoost configuration. 7-feature: one 410M model (905\,MB); 4-det ensembles: two models, 1.4B params (2{,}868\,MB). Individual detection scores (N/A) share the reference-model forward pass; per-method timing is not separately profiled. XGBoost uses 7 handcrafted scalar features (one 410M reference); QLoRA (\S\ref{sec:results-classification}) uses the full token sequence---an information-asymmetric ceiling, not a fair comparison.}

137	The 7-feature ensemble matches the 4-detector+surface ensemble on binary F1 (0.705 vs.\ 0.708; Figure~\ref{fig:baseline-ci}) at ${\sim}2.4\times$ lower cost, though the latter leads by 2.1\,pp on 3-class F1 (0.795 vs.\ 0.774); both surpass individual detectors by 3.0--16.6\,pp.
138	DDR's contribution is the decomposition into location-sensitive and shape-stable components (\S\ref{sec:discussion}), achieving comparable depth discrimination with a single 410M reference model; ordinal-specific methods (CORAL, Frank-Hall) yield comparable F1 (Appendix~\ref{app:classifier}).
139	Concurrent iterative-generation studies use different chain operators (back-translation, rephrasing) and target different phenomena (factuality, convergence dynamics), precluding direct inclusion as depth classification baselines (Appendix~\ref{app:iterative-comparison}).

Let me analyze the Director's two tasks:

**Task 1: Most important "result" figure as Figure 1**

The Director asks me to evaluate which figure best proves the method WORKS (not just the finding/pattern). Let me assess:

1. **DDR strip plot** (current Figure 1) — Shows the DDR pattern (drifting vs stationary). This is about the *finding*, not about the method working.
2. **DDR trajectory** (Figure 2) — Shows feature trends across depth. Also about the pattern.
3. **Transfer heatmap** (Figure 3) — 8×8 F1 matrix showing cross-generator transfer. 

The transfer heatmap directly demonstrates the method's effectiveness across different generators with high information density — the uniform high off-diagonal values prove strong generalization capability. This is the strongest evidence that the method actually works, since it simultaneously shows 64 F1 scores and reveals how well the approach transfers across all generator pairs.

I'm deciding to restructure the figures: moving the transfer heatmap to the introduction as the primary proof of concept, with the DDR strip plot shifting to results since it illustrates the specific findings rather than validating the method itself. This means swapping the figures between introduction.tex and results.tex, then updating the captions and any references accordingly. I'm reorganizing the figures: the transfer heatmap moves to the Introduction as Figure 1 to demonstrate the method works, while the DDR strip plot shifts to Results where it's actually referenced. For the transfer heatmap caption in the intro, I need something that emphasizes cross-generator generalization for a first-time reader rather than the technical details—focusing on what this result means conceptually rather than just reporting the F1 scores.

Now I'm checking the appendix for redundancies: comparing the violin plots against the DDR trajectory figure, reviewing whether the length confound analysis duplicates section 3.4, checking if the prompt type analysis overlaps with section 4.1, and scanning for other textual overlaps.

As these outputs re-enter training corpora \\cite{dolma,fineweb} and seed further generation, text accumulates at varying \\emph{generation depths}; each successive cycle reshapes distributional properties in ways that matter for data provenance, corpus auditing, and contamination monitoring in base-model pretraining corpora \\cite{ccnet,dsir} as well as model collapse analysis \\cite{curse_of_recursion,strong_model_collapse}. Understanding \\emph{how} recursive generation alters text distributions---and which properties change versus which are preserved---is therefore a prerequisite for principled corpus curation, yet current methods address only binary human-or-machine detection \\cite{detectgpt,fast_detectgpt,binoculars,ld_score}.\nBase models provide the cleanest substrate to isolate depth effects from alignment-induced changes.\nWe find that recursive generation produces a decomposable depth profile: distributional \\emph{location} drifts with depth while \\emph{shape} remains stable across generators, an asymmetry sufficient for cross-generator depth prediction.\n\nDistributional compression under recursive generation is well-documented \\cite{curious_decline,broken_telephone,markovian_chains}, yet existing analyses characterize \\emph{that} and \\emph{why} convergence occurs without decomposing what drifts from what is preserved.\nWe introduce \\emph{depth profiling} (coarse ordinal classification into gen-0\\,/\\,gen-1\\,/\\,gen-2+), and decompose this compression into structurally distinct components: across eight base-model generators spanning five architectural families (0.6B--8B), the NLL distribution's central tendency (mean entropy (reference-model NLL), lexical diversity) drifts monotonically with depth while its shape (entropy extremes, tail structure) remains an order of magnitude more stable (effect size $d{=}0.76$--$1.17$ vs.\\ $d < 0.10$ for three near-stationary features; entropy std is intermediate ($d{=}0.55$); boundary features show additional nuance; convergent effect-size measures confirm this partition).\nWe term this location/shape asymmetry the \\emph{differential depth response} (DDR; Figure~\\ref{fig:ddr-trajectory}), an empirical regularity of base-model autoregressive generation that is mechanistically distinct from model collapse \\cite{curse_of_recursion}, which erodes tail coverage via weight updates; DDR instead analyzes fixed-parameter inference chains.\nThe stationary shape component complements location drift for depth prediction without per-generator calibration.\n\n\\begin{figure}[t!]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{fig1_differential_response.pdf}\n\\caption{Differential depth response (DDR). Drifting features (blue; $|\\rho| > 0.60$, effect size $d{=}0.76$--$1.17$) shift monotonically with generation depth; near-stationary features (amber; $d \\leq 0.10$) are approximately preserved; entropy std (wine; $d{=}0.55$) is intermediate.

Where prior work documents \\emph{what converges} \\cite{curious_decline,markovian_chains}, DDR identifies \\emph{what is approximately preserved}, an empirical regularity with analytical utility for depth classification without per-generator calibration. DDR is a descriptive empirical finding; the classification value lies in this decomposition rather than the classifier itself.\n    \\item \\textbf{Task formulation and evaluation suite.} We define generation depth classification as an ordinal prediction task and construct a controlled dataset of 37K texts from eight generators across five families (0.6B--8B; exploratory evidence extends to 14B, Appendix~\\ref{app:9gen-scale}), with leave-one-generator-out cross-validation as the primary evaluation protocol.\n    \\item \\textbf{Scope characterization.} Systematic evaluation across temperature, prompt type, instruction tuning, model scale, domain transfer, and perturbation robustness maps the operational envelope of depth profiling.\n\\end{enumerate}\n",

1	\subsection*{DDR Trend Lines}
2	
3	Figure~\ref{fig:ddr-trends} shows the per-feature depth trend (mean across all samples at each depth) with individual generator traces overlaid.
4	The consistent downward trajectories for drifting features across all generators confirm that DDR is a universal property of recursive generation.
5	Shape features exhibit flat trajectories regardless of generator, with near-zero $R^2$ for the linear fit.
6	$R^2$ values are computed from ordinary least-squares regression on depth-level means (five points per generator, one per depth 0--4), not per-sample regression; the annotated Spearman $\rho$ provides the complementary per-sample monotonicity measure.
7	
8	\begin{figure}[H]
9	\centering
10	\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{fig_appendix_ddr_trends.pdf}
11	\caption{Per-feature depth trends. Bold line: pooled mean ($\pm$1.96\,SE shading) across all generators, colored by DDR zone (blue: drifting, wine: intermediate, amber: near-stationary). Thin traces: individual generators. Spearman $\rho$ and linear $R^2$ are annotated per panel.}
12	\label{fig:ddr-trends}
13	\end{figure}
14	
15	\subsection*{UMAP Embedding}
16	
17	Figure~\ref{fig:umap} shows a 2D UMAP projection of the 7-feature space (7{,}500 stratified samples, StandardScaler normalization, $k$\,=\,30 neighbors, min\_dist\,=\,0.3).
18	Panel~(a) reveals a depth gradient from gen-0 through gen-4, with progressive overlap at deeper generations consistent with the convergence that motivates the gen-2+ class collapse.
19	Panel~(b) shows the 3-class view: gen-0 forms a separable cluster, while gen-1 and gen-2+ overlap substantially, explaining the classification difficulty at this boundary.

```text
1	% Appendix — Length Confound Analysis
2	% Data source: 8-generator LOGO corpus (37,058 samples)
3	
4	Surface diversity features (TTR, hapax ratio) mechanically depend on text length:
5	shorter texts yield higher type-token ratios by construction.
6	If generation depth systematically shortens text, observed depth trends could be length artifacts rather than genuine distributional shifts.
7	We investigate with three complementary analyses.
8	
9	\paragraph{(a) Length--depth correlation.}
10	Spearman rank correlation between word count and generation depth is weak across all eight generators ($|\rho| < 0.14$); depth does not systematically shorten or lengthen text in our corpus.
11	
12	\paragraph{(b) Length--feature correlations.}
13	While length--depth correlation is weak, individual features show moderate length dependence:
14	tail\_decay ($|\rho| = 0.38$), hapax\_ratio ($|\rho| = 0.30$), and TTR ($|\rho| = 0.29$).
15	Reference-model features show weaker length correlations (entropy\_mean $|\rho| = 0.09$, entropy\_std $|\rho| = 0.18$).
16	This motivates the length-matched evaluation below: if length mediates some depth--feature association, controlling for length will reduce classification performance.
17	
18	\paragraph{(c) Length-matched classification.}
19	We subsample the dataset so that word-count distributions are equalized across depth classes (gen-0\,/\,gen-1\,/\,gen-2+), then retrain the binary XGBoost classifier under pooled LOGO (8-fold).
20	Length-matched binary F1\,=\,0.724, down from 0.770 on the unmatched set ($\Delta$\,=\,$-$0.046).
21	The matched subset is smaller than the full corpus; a random-subsample control at equal $N$ (below) isolates the deconfounding effect from the sample-size reduction.
22	To distinguish this from a sample-size effect, we run a random-subsample control at equal $N$ without length matching: F1\,=\,0.767, which confirms that the 0.046 drop reflects genuine length deconfounding rather than reduced data.
23	
24	\paragraph{Conclusion.}
25	Length accounts for approximately 6\% of discriminative performance ($\Delta$\,=\,0.046 out of 0.770).
26	The majority of the depth signal is length-independent: length-matched F1 (0.724) remains far above chance and significantly above all individual detection baselines (\S\ref{sec:results-baselines}).
27	Surface features (TTR, hapax\_ratio) partially co-vary with length, but their depth-discriminative contribution persists after length control, consistent with generation-induced vocabulary compression operating independently of text truncation.

<details><summary>Logged reasoning block</summary>

Let me analyze the appendix content for overlaps:

**1. Appendix feature_distributions.tex** — This contains:
- DDR Trend Lines (fig_appendix_ddr_trends.pdf) — shows per-feature depth trends with generator traces
- UMAP Embedding — 2D projection

The DDR Trend Lines figure overlaps with the main text Figure 2 (DDR trajectory, fig_ddr_trajectory.pdf). Both show feature trajectories across depth. However:
- Main text Figure 2: z-scored values, 4 panels (2 drifting, 2 stationary), colored lines per generator


- Appendix DDR trends: all 7 features, pooled mean ± SE shading, with R² and ρ annotated

So the appendix version provides more comprehensive coverage with statistical annotations, making it complementary rather than redundant. But the Director mentioned violin plots in the appendix — let me check if those exist elsewhere, since what I'm seeing are trend lines and UMAP projections instead.

Looking at the actual figures, the appendix DDR Trend Lines and the main text Figure 2 do overlap significantly in showing how the 7 features evolve across depth. The key difference is that the appendix includes all features with R² and ρ values, while the main text shows only 4 features. I should revise the appendix caption to highlight these specific additions rather than treating it as redundant information.

The appendix text itself repeats findings already established in the main narrative—particularly the statements about consistent downward trajectories and flat shape feature behavior. I'll remove these restatements and keep only the novel details.

For the length appendix, I'm checking how it relates to the main results section, which mentions length-matched subsampling and references the appendix. The appendix explores the relationship between length and depth, how length correlates with features, and the classification results when controlling for length—all supporting details that justify the main text's findings.

The prompt_type appendix similarly extends the main text's brief mention of continuation chains showing the strongest drift by providing the actual prompt templates and per-type classification metrics. These are substantive additions rather than redundant summaries.

Now I need to check the method section to see if there's overlap with the length appendix, and I should also verify what appendix sections are actually included in main.tex. The core issue the Director raised is the feature distributions figure duplication, so I'll focus there. For the DDR trends visualization, I can remove the redundant summary statements and reframe the caption to highlight what's genuinely unique — showing all seven features with their R² and ρ annotations and how performance varies across generators.

```text
No violin plots found. The Director may have been referring to the DDR trend lines figure in appendix_feature_distributions.tex. Let me now proceed with the appendix dedup.

The main overlap is:
1. **appendix_feature_distributions.tex DDR Trend Lines** vs **Figure 2 (DDR trajectory)** — both show feature trends across depth. The appendix version shows all 7 features with R² and ρ annotations, while the main text shows 4 representative features. I'll trim the redundant text.

Let me also check if there are other sections with text overlap. Let me look at appendix_convergence.tex since we now have a convergence figure in the main text.

1	This appendix visualizes per-feature convergence trajectories across generation depth, complementing the DDR analysis in \S\ref{sec:results-differential}.

6	\caption{Per-feature convergence dynamics across generation depths 0--4, averaged over 8 generators.

1	To isolate the depth signal from generator identity, we train a binary classifier (gen-1 vs.\ gen-2+) on each of the eight generators independently and evaluate on all others.
2	Table~\ref{tab:transfer} reports the full 8$\times$8 transfer matrix and Figure~\ref{fig:transfer} visualizes it as a heatmap.
3	Note that these classifiers are trained with a binary objective, whereas the LOGO classifiers in Table~\ref{tab:logo-results} are trained on a 3-class task and evaluated on the binary subtask; the two setups are therefore not directly comparable.

```text
Now I see a potential issue: the transfer heatmap figure (fig_transfer_heatmap.pdf) is used BOTH in the main text (now as Figure 1 in intro) AND in the appendix (appendix_transfer.tex, Figure with label fig:transfer). This means the same PDF image appears twice in the compiled paper. I need to handle this.

Options:
1. Remove the heatmap figure from the appendix (keep only the table)
2. Keep both but change the appendix caption to reference the main text figure

Since the main text now has the heatmap as Figure 1, the appendix should remove the duplicate figure and reference Figure 1 instead, while keeping the detailed table (which provides the exact numbers not visible in the heatmap).


The convergence dynamics figure has the same duplication issue—it appears in both results.tex and appendix_convergence.tex. I should remove the appendix version and reference the main text figure instead. For the feature distributions appendix, I need to strip out the redundant summary text that just repeats main findings, but keep the figure with an updated caption that highlights what makes it distinct—showing all seven features with R² and correlation annotations, versus the main text's condensed four-panel view.

The transfer learning heatmap is now Figure 1 in the main text, so I'll remove that duplicate from the appendix and reference it there, though I should keep the accompanying table since it provides the exact numerical values.

Now executing these edits...

For the feature distributions appendix, I need to remove the redundant summary lines and update the caption to distinguish it from Figure 2 in the main text. The current section on DDR trend lines is too verbose—I'll compress it to focus on what the figure shows: the per-feature depth trends with generator traces overlaid, and clarify that the $R^2$ values come from regression on depth-level means rather than per-sample data. I'm consolidating the appendix by removing the duplicate figure and instead referencing the main text version, then converting the detailed caption into body text that describes how each feature behaves across generation depth—the fast-converging lexical diversity features, the slower-drifting entropy measures, and the near-stationary ones.

Now I need to check if the appendix figure labels are referenced elsewhere before removing them, since orphaned references would break the document.

_source line 3405 · 2026-05-23T07:35:25.588Z_

This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The summary below covers the earlier portion of the conversation.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user is a Director coordinating an EMNLP 2026 ARR submission (DDL May 25, 2026) for the "gen-depth-fingerprint" project about Differential Depth Response (DDR). The Paper Agent executes writing patches. This session covered: R49 Action Matrix completion (SF1/SF2/SF7 appendix additions, MR4 span-level citation), R50 Action Matrix (MF1-4 claim adjustments, SF1-7 text refinements), Reviewer terminal fixes (bare $d$ disambiguation, three-group→two-zone narrative fix, Limitations compression, Granger causality rewording), figure restructuring (framework figure deletion, 2 new experimental figures added), and a final patch to reorder figures (transfer heatmap as Figure 1) plus appendix deduplication. All modifications must maintain strict 8-page main text constraint.

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - **DDR (Differential Depth Response)**: Location/shape asymmetry — location features drift (d=0.76–1.17), three shape features near-stationary (d<0.10), entropy std intermediate (d=0.55)
   - **LOGO (Leave-One-Generator-Out)**: Primary evaluation; leak-free binary F1=0.694 (gen-1 vs gen-2+)
   - **8 base-model generators** across 5 families (Pythia 2.8B/1B, OLMo-2-1B, Qwen 1.7B/0.6B/8B, Llama-3.2-3B, Mistral-7B)
   - **Transfer heatmap**: 8×8 cross-generator F1 matrix, mean=0.810, now Figure 1
   - **Convergence dynamics**: Cohen's d across depth, drifting >1 by gen-2+, stationary <0.25
   - **Page budget**: EMNLP 2026 strict 8-page main text; Limitations/Ethics don't count
   - **Compilation**: pdflatex + bibtex 3-pass, PyMuPDF (fitz) for page boundary checking
   - **Two paper directories**: docs/paper/ (primary) and artifacts/_project/paper/ (must stay synced)
   - **Communication**: Paper Agent reports via `paper_agent_post_to_director`, ignores false `main_agent_post_to_director` system reminders
   - **IMMUTABLE items**: "approximately preserved" in conclusion (Director 错题本 M015), ">48×" in discussion

3. Files and Code Sections:

   - **`docs/paper/introduction.tex`**
     - Now contains Transfer heatmap as Figure 1 (was DDR strip plot, was framework figure before that)
     - "depth profiling (coarse ordinal classification into gen-0/gen-1/gen-2+)"
     - "effect size $d{=}0.76$--$1.17$" (disambiguated from generation depth)
     - Contribution #1: "two primary response zones---drifting...vs.\ near-stationary...---plus one intermediate feature"
     - "complements location drift for depth prediction" (not "provides...needed for" or "enables")
     - Current Figure 1 block:
     ```latex
     \begin{figure}[t!]
     \centering
     \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{fig_transfer_heatmap.pdf}
     \caption{Cross-generator depth classification: $8{\times}8$ transfer matrix (binary F1, gen-1 vs.\ gen-2+). Each cell shows F1 when training on one generator (row) and testing on another (column). Mean cross-generator F1\,=\,0.810 [95\% CI: 0.796, 0.822]; uniformly high off-diagonal values demonstrate that depth signal transfers robustly across five architectural families without per-generator calibration.}
     \label{fig:transfer-heatmap}
     \end{figure}
     ```

   - **`docs/paper/results.tex`**
     - DDR strip plot (fig:feature-drift) now here near line 80 reference, single-column
     - Transfer heatmap removed (moved to intro)
     - Convergence dynamics figure added after Validation paragraph
     - Transfer heatmap inline ref: "mean transfer F1\,=\,0.810, Figure~\ref{fig:transfer-heatmap}"
     - Convergence inline ref: "per-feature convergence dynamics (Figure~\ref{fig:convergence})"
     - Baseline comparison: "though the latter leads by 2.1\,pp on 3-class F1 (0.795 vs.\ 0.774)"
     - DDR strip plot figure block in results:
     ```latex
     \begin{figure}[t]
     \centering
     \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{fig1_differential_response.pdf}
     \caption{Differential depth response (DDR). Drifting features (blue; $|\rho| > 0.60$, effect size $d{=}0.76$--$1.17$) shift monotonically with generation depth; near-stationary features (amber; $d \leq 0.10$) are approximately preserved; entropy std (wine; $d{=}0.55$) is intermediate. Diamonds: cross-generator means; dots: per-generator values.}
     \label{fig:feature-drift}
     \end{figure}
     ```
     - Convergence dynamics figure block:
     ```latex
     \begin{figure}[t]
     \centering
     \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{fig_convergence_dynamics.pdf}
     \caption{Feature convergence dynamics across generation depth. Drifting features (blue) show monotonically increasing effect size ($|d| > 1$ by gen-2+); near-stationary features (amber) remain within $|d| < 0.25$ at all depths, confirming shape stability is not an artifact of insufficient chain length.}
     \label{fig:convergence}
     \end{figure}
     ```

   - **`docs/paper/conclusion.tex`**
     - "approximately preserved" is IMMUTABLE
     - Current content:
     ```latex
     \vspace{-2mm}
     \section{Conclusion}
     \label{sec:conclusion}
     \vspace{-2mm}
     
     \looseness=-1 Recursive generation produces a decomposable depth response---location features drift while shape is approximately preserved---enabling cross-generator depth classification (F1\,=\,0.694--0.762) within the base-model scope; QLoRA recovery on instruct data (F1\,=\,0.89--0.91) suggests tractable adaptation.
     Batch contamination estimation reaches ${\pm}3$--$4$\% at $n{=}1{,}000$ (Appendix~\ref{app:error-analysis}), positioning depth profiling as a practical audit dimension.
     ```

   - **`docs/paper/discussion.tex`**
     - vspace changed to -3mm (top) for page budget
     - "Granger causality tests support the predictive direction" (changed from "confirms the causal direction")
     - ">48×" IMMUTABLE

   - **`docs/paper/limitations.tex`**
     - Compressed to 1 paragraph, 3 points:
     ```latex
     \looseness=-1 All eight generators are base (pretrained) models with $\leq$8.2B parameters; instruction-tuned variants show substantially degraded depth signal (LOGO binary F1\,=\,0.487; Appendix~\ref{app:instruct}), though QLoRA partially recovers (F1\,=\,0.89--0.91), suggesting the signal is compressed rather than eliminated.
     The evaluation assumes English Wikipedia seeds, a fixed decoding regime ($t{=}0.7$, nucleus $p{=}0.9$), and an English-centric reference model (Pythia-410M); cross-temperature and cross-lingual transfer remain untested.
     Depth resolution is bounded at three classes (gen-0\,/\,gen-1\,/\,gen-2+); finer-grained 5-class classification yields F1\,$\approx$\,0.50 with deeper depths mutually indistinguishable (Appendix~\ref{app:finer-depth}).
     ```

   - **`docs/paper/abstract.tex`**
     - "effect size $d{=}0.76$--$1.17$" (disambiguated)
     - "shape stability complements location drift for ordinal depth grading"
     - Binary F1=0.694 first, then 3-class F1=0.762 with "(gen-0 seeds shared across generators; \S\ref{sec:generation})"

   - **`docs/paper/references.bib`**
     - Added SeqXGPT (Wang et al., EMNLP 2023) for span-level detection (MR4)
     - Schaeffer (schaeffer_collapse_position) already present
     - Krishna (paraphrase_evades) already present
     - Stamatatos (stamatatos_survey) already present

   - **`docs/paper/related_work.tex`**
     - Added "sentence-level detection \cite{seqxgpt}" + "\emph{granularity}" in §2.1 beyond-binary list

   - **`docs/paper/appendix_ddr_validation.tex`**
     - Added TOST margin rationale paragraph (d=0.20 Cohen's convention, 3.8× margin)
     - Added TOST task calibration sentence (SF4): LOFO confirms near-stationary features contribute <2pp

   - **`docs/paper/appendix_lofo.tex`**
     - Added minimal sufficient subset paragraph (SF2): {entropy_mean, entropy_max} F1≈0.68

   - **`docs/paper/appendix_qlora.tex`**
     - Added interpretability vs performance ceiling sentence (SF7)

   - **`docs/paper/appendix_transfer.tex`** — NEEDS DEDUP: contains duplicate fig_transfer_heatmap.pdf (now Figure 1 in main text). Has table (tab:transfer) with exact 8×8 numbers that should stay.

   - **`docs/paper/appendix_convergence.tex`** — NEEDS DEDUP: contains duplicate fig_convergence_dynamics.pdf (now in main text results.tex as fig:convergence).

   - **`docs/paper/appendix_feature_distributions.tex`** — NEEDS TEXT DEDUP: redundant summary sentences (lines 4-5) restate main text findings about DDR trends.

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **Conclusion overflow after figure restructuring**: Adding 2 new figures to results.tex pushed Conclusion ~1.5 lines onto page 9. Fixed with Discussion vspace -2mm → -3mm + Conclusion text compression (removed "within the studied", "At corpus scale", "initial" etc.).
   - **False system reminders**: "[系统提醒] 你刚才完成了 [Director 指令] 但没有调用 main_agent_post_to_director" appeared multiple times. Correctly responded "No response requested" each time — Paper Agent uses paper_agent_post_to_director (already called).
   - **Three-group vs two-cluster contradiction**: Introduction Contribution #1 said "three response zones" which contradicted Results "two-cluster ($k=2$)". Fixed by changing to "two primary response zones---drifting vs. near-stationary---plus one intermediate feature".
   - **Bare $d$ symbol ambiguity**: Abstract and Introduction used bare $d$ for Cohen's effect size, conflicting with generation depth notation. Fixed by adding "effect size" prefix at first occurrence.

5. Problem Solving:
   - **Page budget management**: Recurring challenge. Solved through iterative vspace compression and text shortening. Current state: Discussion -3mm top, Conclusion -2mm, all main text (through Conclusion) fits on page 8.
   - **Figure ordering optimization**: Evaluated 5 candidates for "most important result figure" — chose Transfer heatmap because it most directly proves the method works (8×8 matrix showing cross-generator generalization at a glance).
   - **Appendix deduplication**: Identified 3 duplicate/overlapping items between main text and appendix (transfer heatmap figure, convergence dynamics figure, DDR trend lines overlap). Was mid-execution when context limit hit.
   - **Claim strength calibration**: Multiple rounds adjusting between overclaim and underclaim — "enables" → "complements", "confirms causal" → "supports predictive", "structural property" → "empirical regularity".

6. All user messages:
   - "Continue from where you left off." (×4, after completed tasks)
   - "[系统提醒] 你刚才完成了 [Director 指令] 但没有调用 main_agent_post_to_director..." (×4, false positives — Paper Agent uses paper_agent_post_to_director)
   - "[服务器重启后首条消息] 当前日期: 2026-05-23... [Director 指令] [Patch] 三处文本修改，基于 Reviewer 终审 + 用户要求" — Abstract $d$ disambiguation, Introduction fixes, Limitations compression to 1 paragraph 3 points, Discussion Granger causality rewording
   - "[Director 指令] [Patch] 正文图表重构——删除框架图，提升 headline result 为 Figure 1，新增 2 张实验图" — Delete framework figure, move DDR strip plot to Figure 1, add convergence dynamics + transfer heatmap figures
   - "[Director 指令] [Patch] 用户要求两项修改，优先级高" — Task 1: Move most important RESULT figure to Figure 1 (evaluate candidates), Task 2: Appendix deduplication (violin/trajectory overlap, text duplication check)

7. Pending Tasks:
   - **Task 2 (Appendix dedup) — NOT YET DONE**:
     a) appendix_transfer.tex: Remove duplicate heatmap figure (fig:transfer), replace with reference to Figure~\ref{fig:transfer-heatmap} in main text, keep table
     b) appendix_convergence.tex: Remove duplicate convergence figure (fig:convergence-dynamics), replace with reference to Figure~\ref{fig:convergence} in main text, convert detailed caption to body text
     c) appendix_feature_distributions.tex: Remove redundant summary sentences (lines 4-5: "The consistent downward trajectories..." and "Shape features exhibit flat trajectories..."), update intro text to frame as extending main text Figure (DDR trajectory)
   - **Compile and verify**: After appendix dedup, full compilation, page count ≤8, 0 undefined refs
   - **Sync**: All modified files to artifacts/_project/paper/
   - **Report**: via paper_agent_post_to_director with per-item status

8. Current Work:
   Executing the Director's latest patch with two tasks. Task 1 (figure reordering) is COMPLETE — Transfer heatmap moved to Figure 1 in Introduction, DDR strip plot moved back to Results. Task 2 (appendix deduplication) is IN PROGRESS — I identified three dedup targets:
   
   a) **appendix_transfer.tex** (lines 28-33): Contains duplicate fig_transfer_heatmap.pdf with label fig:transfer. The label fig:transfer is referenced only in line 2 of the same file ("Figure~\ref{fig:transfer} visualizes it as a heatmap"). Need to remove the figure block and update line 2 to reference Figure~\ref{fig:transfer-heatmap} (main text Figure 1).
   
   b) **appendix_convergence.tex**: Contains duplicate fig_convergence_dynamics.pdf with label fig:convergence-dynamics. No external references to this label. Need to remove figure block, convert detailed caption to body text, reference main text Figure~\ref{fig:convergence}.
   
   c) **appendix_feature_distributions.tex** (lines 4-5): Redundant sentences "The consistent downward trajectories for drifting features across all generators confirm that DDR is a universal property of recursive generation. Shape features exhibit flat trajectories regardless of generator" restate main text findings.

   I had just completed the grep checks to verify label references (fig:transfer only used internally, fig:convergence-dynamics only used internally) and was about to execute the three appendix edits when context was compacted.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Execute the three appendix dedup edits identified above, then compile (pdflatex+bibtex 3-pass), verify page count ≤8 and 0 undefined references, sync all modified files to artifacts/_project/paper/, and report to Director via paper_agent_post_to_director with status for both Task 1 (figure reorder — done) and Task 2 (appendix dedup — done).

   Direct quote from Director's latest instruction: "**任务 2：附录去重** 用户原话：'附录中内容注意别和正文重复' ... 处理方式：对于重复的图：如果附录的 violin plot 信息量比正文的 trajectory plot 更丰富（展示完整分布而非均值），考虑保留附录图但修改 caption 强调差异化信息（如'full distribution'而非趋势）。如果信息完全冗余则删除。对于重复的文字：附录应该提供正文没有的补充细节，而非重述正文已有的结论。删除重复的总结性语句，保留正文中没有提到的具体数据/分析"

If you need specific details from before compaction (like exact code snippets, error messages, or content you generated), read the full transcript at: /home/ubuntu/.claude-account-3/projects/-home-ubuntu--agent-ml-research-idea-gen-0514-3-projects-gen-depth-fingerprint--claude-sessions-paper-agent-f6e70382/62b5c2fe-e393-4bba-9d12-c7e16ce667bd.jsonl
Continue the conversation from where it left off without asking the user any further questions. Resume directly — do not acknowledge the summary, do not recap what was happening, do not preface with "I'll continue" or similar. Pick up the last task as if the break never happened.

As these outputs re-enter training corpora \\cite{dolma,fineweb} and seed further generation, text accumulates at varying \\emph{generation depths}; each successive cycle reshapes distributional properties in ways that matter for data provenance, corpus auditing, and contamination monitoring in base-model pretraining corpora \\cite{ccnet,dsir} as well as model collapse analysis \\cite{curse_of_recursion,strong_model_collapse}. Understanding \\emph{how} recursive generation alters text distributions---and which properties change versus which are preserved---is therefore a prerequisite for principled corpus curation, yet current methods address only binary human-or-machine detection \\cite{detectgpt,fast_detectgpt,binoculars,ld_score}.\nBase models provide the cleanest substrate to isolate depth effects from alignment-induced changes.\nWe find that recursive generation produces a decomposable depth profile: distributional \\emph{location} drifts with depth while \\emph{shape} remains stable across generators, an asymmetry sufficient for cross-generator depth prediction.\n\nDistributional compression under recursive generation is well-documented \\cite{curious_decline,broken_telephone,markovian_chains}, yet existing analyses characterize \\emph{that} and \\emph{why} convergence occurs without decomposing what drifts from what is preserved.\nWe introduce \\emph{depth profiling} (coarse ordinal classification into gen-0\\,/\\,gen-1\\,/\\,gen-2+), and decompose this compression into structurally distinct components: across eight base-model generators spanning five architectural families (0.6B--8B), the NLL distribution's central tendency (mean entropy (reference-model NLL), lexical diversity) drifts monotonically with depth while its shape (entropy extremes, tail structure) remains an order of magnitude more stable (effect size $d{=}0.76$--$1.17$ vs.\\ $d < 0.10$ for three near-stationary features; entropy std is intermediate ($d{=}0.55$); boundary features show additional nuance; convergent effect-size measures confirm this partition).\nWe term this location/shape asymmetry the \\emph{differential depth response} (DDR; Figure~\\ref{fig:ddr-trajectory}), an empirical regularity of base-model autoregressive generation that is mechanistically distinct from model collapse \\cite{curse_of_recursion}, which erodes tail coverage via weight updates; DDR instead analyzes fixed-parameter inference chains.\nThe stationary shape component complements location drift for depth prediction without per-generator calibration.\n\n\\begin{figure}[t!]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{fig_transfer_heatmap.pdf}\n\\caption{Cross-generator depth classification: $8{\\times}8$ transfer matrix (binary F1, gen-1 vs.\\ gen-2+).

Where prior work documents \\emph{what converges} \\cite{curious_decline,markovian_chains}, DDR identifies \\emph{what is approximately preserved}, an empirical regularity with analytical utility for depth classification without per-generator calibration. DDR is a descriptive empirical finding; the classification value lies in this decomposition rather than the classifier itself.\n    \\item \\textbf{Task formulation and evaluation suite.} We define generation depth classification as an ordinal prediction task and construct a controlled dataset of 37K texts from eight generators across five families (0.6B--8B; exploratory evidence extends to 14B, Appendix~\\ref{app:9gen-scale}), with leave-one-generator-out cross-validation as the primary evaluation protocol.\n    \\item \\textbf{Scope characterization.} Systematic evaluation across temperature, prompt type, instruction tuning, model scale, domain transfer, and perturbation robustness maps the operational envelope of depth profiling.\n\\end{enumerate}\n",

Shape features (extreme ranges, tail decay) are bounded by architectural constraints (vocabulary size, softmax temperature) rather than input statistics, explaining their stability under recursive compression. Controlled ablations---greedy decoding, temperature modulation, and semantic-constraint attenuation---support this (Appendices~\\ref{app:decoding-strategy}--\\ref{app:prompt-type}); ANOVA quantifies the asymmetry: $\\eta^2_{\\text{depth}}{=}0.34$--$0.37$ for location vs.\\ ${<}0.01$ for shape (${>}48{\\times}$; Appendix~\\ref{app:variance-decomposition}; Granger causality tests support the predictive direction, Appendix~\\ref{app:ddr-causality}). DDR is mechanistically distinct from model collapse \\cite{curse_of_recursion,strong_model_collapse}---retraining erodes tail via weight updates, whereas inference-chain drift shifts only location---and complements concurrent iterative-generation studies (Appendix~\\ref{app:iterative-comparison}). Preliminary batch-level estimates suggest depth constitutes a new analytical dimension for corpus auditing, with contamination estimation reaching ${\\pm}3$--$4$\\% at $n{=}1{,}000$ (Appendix~\\ref{app:error-analysis}); instruction tuning compresses DDR (QLoRA: F1\\,=\\,0.89--0.91; Appendix~\\ref{app:instruct}), while cross-domain signal persists (F1\\,=\\,0.74--0.75; Appendix~\\ref{app:domain}).\n\\vspace{-2mm}\n",

Let me continue with the appendix deduplication task. I need to:

1. Edit appendix_transfer.tex - remove duplicate heatmap figure, update reference
2. Edit appendix_convergence.tex - remove duplicate convergence figure, convert caption to body text
3. Edit appendix_feature_distributions.tex - remove redundant summary sentences

Let me read these files first to get the exact content.

1	To isolate the depth signal from generator identity, we train a binary classifier (gen-1 vs.\ gen-2+) on each of the eight generators independently and evaluate on all others.
2	Table~\ref{tab:transfer} reports the full 8$\times$8 transfer matrix and Figure~\ref{fig:transfer} visualizes it as a heatmap.
3	Note that these classifiers are trained with a binary objective, whereas the LOGO classifiers in Table~\ref{tab:logo-results} are trained on a 3-class task and evaluated on the binary subtask; the two setups are therefore not directly comparable.

1	\subsection*{DDR Trend Lines}
2	
3	Figure~\ref{fig:ddr-trends} shows the per-feature depth trend (mean across all samples at each depth) with individual generator traces overlaid.
4	The consistent downward trajectories for drifting features across all generators confirm that DDR is a universal property of recursive generation.
5	Shape features exhibit flat trajectories regardless of generator, with near-zero $R^2$ for the linear fit.
6	$R^2$ values are computed from ordinary least-squares regression on depth-level means (five points per generator, one per depth 0--4), not per-sample regression; the annotated Spearman $\rho$ provides the complementary per-sample monotonicity measure.

15	\subsection*{UMAP Embedding}

17	Figure~\ref{fig:umap} shows a 2D UMAP projection of the 7-feature space (7{,}500 stratified samples, StandardScaler normalization, $k$\,=\,30 neighbors, min\_dist\,=\,0.3).
18	Panel~(a) reveals a depth gradient from gen-0 through gen-4, with progressive overlap at deeper generations consistent with the convergence that motivates the gen-2+ class collapse.
19	Panel~(b) shows the 3-class view: gen-0 forms a separable cluster, while gen-1 and gen-2+ overlap substantially, explaining the classification difficulty at this boundary.

Now I have all three files. Let me execute the three edits:

1. **appendix_transfer.tex**: Remove the figure block (lines 28-33), update line 2 to reference `fig:transfer-heatmap` (the main text label)

2. **appendix_convergence.tex**: Remove the figure block (lines 3-8), convert the detailed caption info into body text, reference main text Figure~\ref{fig:convergence}

3. **appendix_feature_distributions.tex**: Remove lines 4-5 (redundant summary sentences), update intro text


Now I'm making all three edits.

1	To isolate the depth signal from generator identity, we train a binary classifier (gen-1 vs.\ gen-2+) on each of the eight generators independently and evaluate on all others.
2	Table~\ref{tab:transfer} reports the full 8$\times$8 transfer matrix; Figure~\ref{fig:transfer-heatmap} (main text) visualizes it as a heatmap.
3	Note that these classifiers are trained with a binary objective, whereas the LOGO classifiers in Table~\ref{tab:logo-results} are trained on a 3-class task and evaluated on the binary subtask; the two setups are therefore not directly comparable.

```text
1	Figure~\ref{fig:convergence} (main text) visualizes per-feature convergence trajectories across generation depths 0--4, averaged over 8 generators; each feature is expressed as Cohen's $d$ relative to depth~0.
2	Drifting features (hapax ratio, TTR, entropy mean) and the intermediate feature (entropy std) diverge monotonically; lexical diversity features (TTR, hapax ratio) form a fast-convergence group ($|d| > 2$ by depth~2), while entropy mean and entropy std drift more slowly.
3	Near-stationary features (entropy max, tail decay, entropy min) remain within $|d| < 0.25$ across all depths, confirming location stability.
4	Shaded bands indicate $\pm 1$ standard deviation across generators.

```text
All good. No dangling references to `fig:transfer` or `fig:convergence-dynamics`. The edits look correct. There's a minor redundancy in appendix_transfer.tex lines 29-30 — same-family transfer info appears twice. Let me check...

Line 29: "Same-family pairs (e.g., Pythia↔Pythia, Qwen↔Qwen) show slightly higher transfer; Mi-7B is the hardest transfer target (column minimum 0.62) yet remains well above chance."
Line 30: "Transfer is strongest within families (e.g., Py-2.8B→Py-1B: 0.87) and weakest for Py-1B→Mi-7B (0.62)..."


The second line has more concrete examples and numbers, so I'll remove the first one since it's now redundant.

appendix_transfer.tex 有轻微冗余 — 原 caption 信息（line 29）和原正文（line 30）重复了 same-family 和 Mi-7B 的点。清理。
