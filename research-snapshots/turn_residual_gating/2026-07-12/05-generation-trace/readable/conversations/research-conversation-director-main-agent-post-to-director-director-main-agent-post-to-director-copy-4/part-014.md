4	\subsection{Setup}
5	
6	We fine-tune Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct on 8K multi-turn conversations from the UltraChat training split, a dataset of naturalistic dialogues across diverse topics. LoRA adapters (rank 16, $\alpha$=32) are applied to query and value projection layers (\texttt{q\_proj}, \texttt{v\_proj}). The combined loss $\mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}_\text{NTP} + \lambda_\text{GAR}\mathcal{L}_\text{GAR} + \lambda_\text{div}\mathcal{L}_\text{div}$ uses $\lambda_\text{GAR} = \lambda_\text{div} = 1.0$ with MSE target $\tau = 0.5$ (\S\ref{sec:loss}). We train for 3 epochs with AdamW (lr $= 2 \times 10^{-4}$, batch size 1, gradient accumulation 8, seed 42; ThreadGate additionally with seed 123); each variant requires approximately 6 hours on a single NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell Server Edition GPU (102\,GB). Full hyperparameters are provided in Appendix~\ref{sec:appendix-hyper}.
7	
8	We evaluate five configurations that form a controlled comparison isolating four factors. \textbf{ThreadGate}: full system with 28 gate networks (Eq.~\ref{eq:gate}) and three-term loss. \textbf{+PCGrad}: ThreadGate with PCGrad \citep{yu2020pcgrad} projecting conflicting gradients (isolates gradient conflict). \textbf{Uniform Gate}: identical gate architecture with turn embedding replaced by a still-learnable constant vector (content-conditioned but turn-unaware; isolates turn conditioning). \textbf{LoRA-only}: gates fixed at 1.0, trained with $\mathcal{L}_\text{NTP} + \mathcal{L}_\text{GAR}$ only (isolates gating mechanism). \textbf{Base}: pretrained model (isolates fine-tuning). All fine-tuned variants share training data, LoRA configuration, optimizer, and seed. We evaluate under \emph{IID} (same-distribution UltraChat text) and \emph{held-out} (50 non-overlapping conversations) teacher-forced protocols, reporting GAR-ours (last-token attention to goals, \S\ref{sec:background}), GAR-Dongre \citep{dongre2026attention} (all-token average), and PPL.
9	
10	\subsection{Main Results}
11	
12	Table~\ref{tab:four-way} presents the five-way comparison. The central finding is that all four fine-tuned variants converge to nearly identical performance. GAR-ours spans only 0.75 percentage points (pp) across ThreadGate (0.50), +PCGrad (0.50), Uniform Gate (0.51), and LoRA-only (0.50), and PPL is 2.78 for all four on IID evaluation. Neither per-layer gating (ThreadGate), elimination of gradient direction conflict (+PCGrad), nor content-only gating (Uniform Gate) provides any measurable benefit over LoRA-only fine-tuning.
13	
14	The Base model confirms that LoRA fine-tuning is the operative variable: GAR-ours jumps from 0.01 to ${\sim}$0.50, while PPL improves from 4.23 to 2.78. Since all four variants share the same GAR loss ($\tau = 0.5$), convergence near the target is expected and does not demonstrate gating benefit. We cannot exclude LoRA capacity saturation at rank~16, though uniform convergence across four architecturally distinct variants makes this unlikely. GAR-Dongre remains uniformly low (0.01--0.02) across all standard-trained conditions, consistent with \citet{dongre2026attention}; a preliminary scheduled sampling experiment breaks this pattern (\S\ref{sec:discussion}).
15	
16	The teacher-forced GAR-ours of 0.50--0.51 stands in sharp contrast to autoregressive generation, where GAR-ours drops to 0.015--0.025 across all fine-tuned variants, a 20--33$\times$ gap. This gap is universal: it persists across all training strategies---gating, gradient conflict elimination, and LoRA-only fine-tuning alike. A second ThreadGate seed (123) confirms stability: TF GAR-ours $0.504\pm0.001$, AR GAR-ours $0.016\pm0.001$, gap ${\sim}$31$\times$ (range 30.5--32.1$\times$), with identical PPL. We analyze this distribution shift in \S\ref{sec:analysis}.

46	\subsection{Inference-Time Attention Steering}\label{subsec:steering}
47	
48	All training-time interventions fail uniformly. We test whether inference-time attention manipulation can recover GAR by applying an additive bias $\beta$ to goal-token attention logits at every layer of the ThreadGate checkpoint during generation.
49	
50	An initial sweep on $N$\,=\,5 ten-turn conversations (Figure~\ref{fig:steering}a) reveals a sharp nonlinearity between $\beta$\,=\,2 and $\beta$\,=\,5: GAR increases ${\sim}$11$\times$ (0.062\,$\to$\,0.6795$\pm$0.020) while PPL rises 35\% (1.41\,$\to$\,1.91). At $\beta$\,=\,10, GAR saturates at 0.959 but PPL degrades to 4.22.
51	
52	$N$\,=\,50 conversations from a held-out evaluation set (39 with $\geq$3 turns, mean 3.6 user turns; Figure~\ref{fig:steering}b) confirm the qualitative steering pattern observed in the $N$\,=\,5 pilot (10 turns each), with consistent nonlinearity range and saturation behavior. A finer $\beta$ sweep localizes the nonlinearity: GAR jumps from 0.128$\pm$0.110 ($\beta$\,=\,2) to 0.556$\pm$0.060 ($\beta$\,=\,3), an 8.7$\times$ recovery from baseline with only 9\% PPL increase (1.43\,$\to$\,1.56), identifying $\beta$\,=\,3 as a practical operating point. The $\beta$\,=\,0 distribution is right-skewed (mean 0.064, median 0.031, std 0.081), driven by short conversations with high baseline GAR; absolute baselines therefore differ from the 10-turn $N$\,=\,5 evaluation (0.028). At $\beta$\,=\,5, GAR reaches 0.727$\pm$0.061 with PPL 1.77$\pm$0.27, confirming the recovery pattern at scale.
53	
54	These results provide constructive evidence that attention misallocation---not representation degradation---is a proximal cause of exposure-bias-induced GAR failure under the tested conditions (Qwen-2.5-7B, UltraChat, GAR-family losses): manually correcting attention via $\beta$ bias restores GAR, and inference-time intervention circumvents the exposure bias barrier. This steering experiment is diagnostic: it requires identifying goal tokens, trivial for system prompts but not generalizable.

High-$\beta$ results are consistent across sample sizes. Dotted line: unsteered teacher-forced baseline.}

Now for Item 6 (number de-duplication). Let me check which occurrences of "20--33$\times$" can be trimmed.

Current occurrences in .tex files (excluding .aux):
1. abstract.tex: "a 20--33$\times$ gap" — KEEP (first mention)
2. introduction.tex line 12: let me check the exact context
3. introduction.tex line 20: let me check
4. experiments.tex line 16: "where GAR-ours drops to 0.015--0.025 across all fine-tuned variants, a 20--33$\times$ gap"


5. experiments.tex line 21 (Table caption): "the 20--33$\times$ TF-AR gap persists"
6. analysis.tex line 18 (Fig 3b caption): "the 20--33$\times$ TF-AR GAR gap persists"

I've already updated the abstract. Now checking the introduction — line 12 has it in a figure overview caption showing the autoregressive drop to 0.015--0.025, and line 18 mentions it again in contribution 2, while line 20 might not have it at all.

For the "20--33" reduction, I need to get down to 3 occurrences total. I'm keeping it in the abstract, experiments main text, and introduction contributions, but removing it from the experiments table caption, analysis figure caption, and figure overview caption — replacing those with "order-of-magnitude" or ">25$\times$" instead. Let me verify the exact locations in introduction.tex to finalize this.

1	\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
2	
3	Multi-turn dialogue is the dominant mode of interaction with large language models (LLMs), and system prompts that specify task goals form the foundation of instruction following. As conversations grow longer, however, models progressively lose track of these goal specifications. \citet{dongre2026attention} quantified this degradation across 12 models: the Goal Accessibility Ratio (GAR), which measures how much attention the model allocates to goal tokens in the system prompt, declines by 27--48\% between early and mid-conversation turns. We replicate and extend this finding on Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct, observing a 70.8\% relative decline in GAR from 0.0418 at turn~1 to 0.0122 at mid-conversation. We attribute the steeper decline partly to our use of last-token GAR, which captures summary-position attention more sensitively than the all-token average of \citet{dongre2026attention}, and partly to Qwen-2.5-7B's stronger instruction-following fidelity in early turns. This attention decay represents a systematic failure of multi-turn models to maintain task coherence, and it grows worse with each additional turn.
4	
5	A striking aspect of this degradation is what it does \emph{not} affect. \citet{dongre2026attention} showed that goal-relevant information persists in the residual stream throughout the conversation: linear discriminant analysis probes recover goal content with AUC\,=\,0.98 even at late turns where attention to goal tokens has collapsed. The information is present in the hidden states, but the attention mechanism fails to route it toward the output computation. This dissociation between information availability and information utilization suggests a natural intervention point.
6	
7	If the residual stream already carries goal information, a learnable gate on the residual pathway could amplify or attenuate layer contributions to recover goal attention. This reasoning motivates ThreadGate, which modulates each residual update with a content-and-turn-conditioned MLP gate: $x_{l+1} = x_l + g_l \cdot f_l(x_l)$, where $g_l$ is produced by a two-layer network conditioned on the hidden state and turn features, inspired by the residual scaling idea of ReZero \citep{bachlechner2021rezero}.

12	  \caption{Overview of ThreadGate and its failure mode. (Left) ThreadGate adds per-layer content-and-turn-conditioned MLP gates to the residual stream, trained jointly with an auxiliary GAR loss that targets goal attention. (Right) Under teacher-forced evaluation, GAR-ours reaches 0.50 across all fine-tuned variants; under autoregressive generation, it drops to 0.015--0.025, a 20--33$\times$ gap. The five-way comparison (ThreadGate, +PCGrad, Uniform Gate, LoRA-only, Base) shows that no intervention provides measurable benefit over LoRA-only fine-tuning.}

14	\end{figure*}
15	
16	ThreadGate combines per-layer MLP gate networks with a joint training objective: next-token prediction (NTP), an auxiliary GAR loss ($\tau = 0.5$), and a gate diversity loss (\S\ref{sec:method}). The final formulation emerged from seven iterations spanning four loss families; only MSE target with gate diversity converged stably. To diagnose the failure, we construct a five-way controlled comparison (ThreadGate, +PCGrad, Uniform Gate, LoRA-only, Base) where each pair isolates one factor (\S\ref{sec:experiments}). PCGrad \citep{yu2020pcgrad} serves a dual role: training strategy and exclusion tool that rules out gradient direction conflict.
17	
18	Training succeeds: teacher-forced GAR-ours reaches 0.50 across all fine-tuned variants. The five-way comparison reveals that the failure is specific to autoregressive generation, where GAR-ours drops to 0.015--0.025, a gap exceeding an order of magnitude that persists across all training strategies. All four fine-tuned variants achieve indistinguishable performance (0.75\,pp spread on GAR-ours, identical PPL at 2.78); the gating contrast confirms that gates contribute zero measurable benefit. The PCGrad exclusion experiment eliminates gradient direction conflict without altering any outcome, establishing that conflict is neither necessary nor sufficient for the failure. These contrasts converge on exposure bias \citep{bengio2015scheduled}, where attention patterns optimized under teacher-forced prefixes do not transfer to model-generated text (Figure~\ref{fig:overview}). An inference-time steering experiment provides constructive evidence that attention misallocation is a proximal cause: additive attention bias recovers autoregressive GAR from 0.064 to 0.727, bypassing the exposure bias barrier (\S\ref{subsec:steering}). A preliminary scheduled sampling experiment confirms that the gap is also mitigable at training time: GAR-ours increases from 0.016 to 0.318 (20$\times$), compressing the ${\sim}$31$\times$ gap to 1.57$\times$ with no PPL cost (single seed; \S\ref{sec:discussion}).
19	
20	Our contributions: (1)~a systematic diagnostic framework for analyzing auxiliary objective failures in multi-turn dialogue, comprising a five-way controlled comparison that isolates four factors (turn conditioning, gating mechanism, gradient direction conflict, and fine-tuning), PCGrad-based exclusion via gradient surgery \citep{yu2020pcgrad}, and per-layer gradient conflict quantification (\S\ref{sec:method}, \S\ref{sec:experiments}, \S\ref{sec:analysis}); (2)~an empirical characterization of how exposure bias selectively destroys auxiliary attention loss generalization (20--33$\times$ gap) while leaving NTP robust, with evidence that token-level self-recovery \citep{he2019exposure} does not extend to auxiliary objectives, a preliminary demonstration that scheduled sampling compresses this gap from ${\sim}$31$\times$ to 1.57$\times$ (single seed), and cross-model confirmation on Llama-3.1-8B (27$\times$ gap); (3)~an inference-time steering experiment: additive attention bias at $\beta$\,=\,5 recovers autoregressive GAR from 0.064 to 0.727, providing constructive evidence that attention misallocation---not representation degradation---is a proximal cause under the tested conditions (Qwen-2.5-7B and Llama-3.1-8B, UltraChat, GAR-family losses; \S\ref{subsec:steering}); (4)~a principled negative baseline: seven loss configurations across four families (Table~\ref{tab:loss-iterations}; Appendix~\ref{sec:appendix-loss}), of which only MSE converges, and a five-way comparison ruling out four alternative training strategies (\S\ref{sec:method}, \S\ref{sec:experiments}).

Now I can see the occurrences. For "20--33$\times$":

1. abstract.tex: "a 20--33$\times$ gap" — KEEP (first mention, defines the gap)
2. introduction.tex line 12 (Fig 1 caption): "a 20--33$\times$ gap" — can change to ">25$\times$"
3. introduction.tex line 18: uses "a gap exceeding an order of magnitude" — no "20--33" here! Good.
4. introduction.tex line 20 (contribution 2): "(20--33$\times$ gap)" — KEEP (contribution claim)


5. experiments.tex line 16: "a 20--33$\times$ gap" — KEEP (first detailed mention)
6. experiments.tex line 21 (Table 1 caption): "the 20--33$\times$ TF-AR gap" — can change to ">25$\times$"
7. analysis.tex line 18 (Fig 3b caption): "the 20--33$\times$ TF-AR GAR gap" — can change to "order-of-magnitude"

So I have five exact mentions of "20--33" to work with. I should keep the ones that establish the key claims and replace the redundant figure captions with the broader approximations.

For the captions, I'll change the Fig 1 caption to use ">25$\times$", simplify Table 1 to "order-of-magnitude", and strip the specific numbers from Fig 3b entirely. That brings me down to three occurrences of the exact range, appearing in the abstract, the main experiments section, and the contributions. Now I'm looking at the "0.064 to 0.727" range that appears in the discussion section.

In the introduction body, I can replace the specific numbers with a multiplier notation like ">11$\times$" to show the recovery magnitude without the exact values. The contribution statement should keep the full numbers since that's the key claim. Checking the experiments section too to see if that range appears there as well. Now I'm checking the abstract to confirm it doesn't include the "31×" reference, which it doesn't. So that ratio appears three times total across the document, which seems reasonable. I'll proceed with the de-duplication edits: simplifying the figure and table captions, and streamlining the numerical range in the introduction.

    "originalFile": "\\section{Introduction}\\label{sec:introduction}\n\nMulti-turn dialogue is the dominant mode of interaction with large language models (LLMs), and system prompts that specify task goals form the foundation of instruction following. As conversations grow longer, however, models progressively lose track of these goal specifications. \\citet{dongre2026attention} quantified this degradation across 12 models: the Goal Accessibility Ratio (GAR), which measures how much attention the model allocates to goal tokens in the system prompt, declines by 27--48\\% between early and mid-conversation turns. We replicate and extend this finding on Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct, observing a 70.8\\% relative decline in GAR from 0.0418 at turn~1 to 0.0122 at mid-conversation. We attribute the steeper decline partly to our use of last-token GAR, which captures summary-position attention more sensitively than the all-token average of \\citet{dongre2026attention}, and partly to Qwen-2.5-7B's stronger instruction-following fidelity in early turns. This attention decay represents a systematic failure of multi-turn models to maintain task coherence, and it grows worse with each additional turn.\n\nA striking aspect of this degradation is what it does \\emph{not} affect. \\citet{dongre2026attention} showed that goal-relevant information persists in the residual stream throughout the conversation: linear discriminant analysis probes recover goal content with AUC\\,=\\,0.98 even at late turns where attention to goal tokens has collapsed. The information is present in the hidden states, but the attention mechanism fails to route it toward the output computation. This dissociation between information availability and information utilization suggests a natural intervention point.\n\nIf the residual stream already carries goal information, a learnable gate on the residual pathway could amplify or attenuate layer contributions to recover goal attention. This reasoning motivates ThreadGate, which modulates each residual update with a content-and-turn-conditioned MLP gate: $x_{l+1} = x_l + g_l \\cdot f_l(x_l)$, where $g_l$ is produced by a two-layer network conditioned on the hidden state and turn features, inspired by the residual scaling idea of ReZero \\citep{bachlechner2021rezero}.\n\n\\begin{figure*}[t]\n  \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{fig1_overview.pdf}\n  \\caption{Overview of ThreadGate and its failure mode. (Left) ThreadGate adds per-layer content-and-turn-conditioned MLP gates to the residual stream, trained jointly with an auxiliary GAR loss that targets goal attention. (Right) Under teacher-forced evaluation, GAR-ours reaches 0.50 across all fine-tuned variants; under autoregressive generation, it drops to 0.015--0.025, a 20--33$\\times$ gap. The five-way comparison (ThreadGate, +PCGrad, Uniform Gate, LoRA-only, Base) shows that no intervention provides measurable benefit over LoRA-only fine-tuning.}\n  \\label{fig:overview}\n\\end{figure*}\n\nThreadGate combines per-layer MLP gate networks with a joint training objective: next-token prediction (NTP), an auxiliary GAR loss ($\\tau = 0.5$), and a gate diversity loss (\\S\\ref{sec:method}). The final formulation emerged from seven iterations spanning four loss families; only MSE target with gate diversity converged stably. To diagnose the failure, we construct a five-way controlled comparison (ThreadGate, +PCGrad, Uniform Gate, LoRA-only, Base) where each pair isolates one factor (\\S\\ref{sec:experiments}). PCGrad \\citep{yu2020pcgrad} serves a dual role: training strategy and exclusion tool that rules out gradient direction conflict.\n\nTraining succeeds: teacher-forced GAR-ours reaches 0.50 across all fine-tuned variants. The five-way comparison reveals that the failure is specific to autoregressive generation, where GAR-ours drops to 0.015--0.025, a gap exceeding an order of magnitude that persists across all training strategies. All four fine-tuned variants achieve indistinguishable performance (0.75\\,pp spread on GAR-ours, identical PPL at 2.78); the gating contrast confirms that gates contribute zero measurable benefit. The PCGrad exclusion experiment eliminates gradient direction conflict without altering any outcome, establishing that conflict is neither necessary nor sufficient for the failure. These contrasts converge on exposure bias \\citep{bengio2015scheduled}, where attention patterns optimized under teacher-forced prefixes do not transfer to model-generated text (Figure~\\ref{fig:overview}). An inference-time steering experiment provides constructive evidence that attention misallocation is a proximal cause: additive attention bias recovers autoregressive GAR from 0.064 to 0.727, bypassing the exposure bias barrier (\\S\\ref{subsec:steering}). A preliminary scheduled sampling experiment confirms that the gap is also mitigable at training time: GAR-ours increases from 0.016 to 0.318 (20$\\times$), compressing the ${\\sim}$31$\\times$ gap to 1.57$\\times$ with no PPL cost (single seed; \\S\\ref{sec:discussion}).\n\nOur contributions: (1)~a systematic diagnostic framework for analyzing auxiliary objective failures in multi-turn dialogue, comprising a five-way controlled comparison that isolates four factors (turn conditioning, gating mechanism, gradient direction conflict, and fine-tuning), PCGrad-based exclusion via gradient surgery \\citep{yu2020pcgrad}, and per-layer gradient conflict quantification (\\S\\ref{sec:method}, \\S\\ref{sec:experiments}, \\S\\ref{sec:analysis}); (2)~an empirical characterization of how exposure bias selectively destroys auxiliary attention loss generalization (20--33$\\times$ gap) while leaving NTP robust, with evidence that token-level self-recovery \\citep{he2019exposure} does not extend to auxiliary objectives, a preliminary demonstration that scheduled sampling compresses this gap from ${\\sim}$31$\\times$ to 1.57$\\times$ (single seed), and cross-model confirmation on Llama-3.1-8B (27$\\times$ gap); (3)~an inference-time steering experiment: additive attention bias at $\\beta$\\,=\\,5 recovers autoregressive GAR from 0.064 to 0.727, providing constructive evidence that attention misallocation---not representation degradation---is a proximal cause under the tested conditions (Qwen-2.5-7B and Llama-3.1-8B, UltraChat, GAR-family losses; \\S\\ref{subsec:steering}); (4)~a principled negative baseline: seven loss configurations across four families (Table~\\ref{tab:loss-iterations}; Appendix~\\ref{sec:appendix-loss}), of which only MSE converges, and a five-way comparison ruling out four alternative training strategies (\\S\\ref{sec:method}, \\S\\ref{sec:experiments}).",

LoRA adapters (rank 16, $\\alpha$=32) are applied to query and value projection layers (\\texttt{q\\_proj}, \\texttt{v\\_proj}). The combined loss $\\mathcal{L} = \\mathcal{L}_\\text{NTP} + \\lambda_\\text{GAR}\\mathcal{L}_\\text{GAR} + \\lambda_\\text{div}\\mathcal{L}_\\text{div}$ uses $\\lambda_\\text{GAR} = \\lambda_\\text{div} = 1.0$ with MSE target $\\tau = 0.5$ (\\S\\ref{sec:loss}). We train for 3 epochs with AdamW (lr $= 2 \\times 10^{-4}$, batch size 1, gradient accumulation 8, seed 42; ThreadGate additionally with seed 123); each variant requires approximately 6 hours on a single NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell Server Edition GPU (102\\,GB). Full hyperparameters are provided in Appendix~\\ref{sec:appendix-hyper}.\n\nWe evaluate five configurations that form a controlled comparison isolating four factors. \\textbf{ThreadGate}: full system with 28 gate networks (Eq.~\\ref{eq:gate}) and three-term loss. \\textbf{+PCGrad}: ThreadGate with PCGrad \\citep{yu2020pcgrad} projecting conflicting gradients (isolates gradient conflict). \\textbf{Uniform Gate}: identical gate architecture with turn embedding replaced by a still-learnable constant vector (content-conditioned but turn-unaware; isolates turn conditioning). \\textbf{LoRA-only}: gates fixed at 1.0, trained with $\\mathcal{L}_\\text{NTP} + \\mathcal{L}_\\text{GAR}$ only (isolates gating mechanism). \\textbf{Base}: pretrained model (isolates fine-tuning). All fine-tuned variants share training data, LoRA configuration, optimizer, and seed. We evaluate under \\emph{IID} (same-distribution UltraChat text) and \\emph{held-out} (50 non-overlapping conversations) teacher-forced protocols, reporting GAR-ours (last-token attention to goals, \\S\\ref{sec:background}), GAR-Dongre \\citep{dongre2026attention} (all-token average), and PPL.\n\n\\subsection{Main Results}\n\nTable~\\ref{tab:four-way} presents the five-way comparison. The central finding is that all four fine-tuned variants converge to nearly identical performance. GAR-ours spans only 0.75 percentage points (pp) across ThreadGate (0.50), +PCGrad (0.50), Uniform Gate (0.51), and LoRA-only (0.50), and PPL is 2.78 for all four on IID evaluation. Neither per-layer gating (ThreadGate), elimination of gradient direction conflict (+PCGrad), nor content-only gating (Uniform Gate) provides any measurable benefit over LoRA-only fine-tuning.\n\nThe Base model confirms that LoRA fine-tuning is the operative variable: GAR-ours jumps from 0.01 to ${\\sim}$0.50, while PPL improves from 4.23 to 2.78. Since all four variants share the same GAR loss ($\\tau = 0.5$), convergence near the target is expected and does not demonstrate gating benefit. We cannot exclude LoRA capacity saturation at rank~16, though uniform convergence across four architecturally distinct variants makes this unlikely. GAR-Dongre remains uniformly low (0.01--0.02) across all standard-trained conditions, consistent with \\citet{dongre2026attention}; a preliminary scheduled sampling experiment breaks this pattern (\\S\\ref{sec:discussion}).\n\nThe teacher-forced GAR-ours of 0.50--0.51 stands in sharp contrast to autoregressive generation, where GAR-ours drops to 0.015--0.025 across all fine-tuned variants, a 20--33$\\times$ gap. This gap is universal: it persists across all training strategies---gating, gradient conflict elimination, and LoRA-only fine-tuning alike. A second ThreadGate seed (123) confirms stability: TF GAR-ours $0.504\\pm0.001$, AR GAR-ours $0.016\\pm0.001$, gap ${\\sim}$31$\\times$ (range 30.5--32.1$\\times$), with identical PPL. We analyze this distribution shift in \\S\\ref{sec:analysis}.\n\n\\begin{table*}[t]\n\\centering\n\\small\n\\caption{Five-way comparison on Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct.

Despite this preservation, autoregressive GAR collapses to 0.015--0.025 for all variants (Table~\\ref{tab:four-way}), consistent with distribution shift as the primary failure mode under these conditions.}\n  \\label{fig:attention-heatmap}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\subsection{Inference-Time Attention Steering}\\label{subsec:steering}\n\nAll training-time interventions fail uniformly. We test whether inference-time attention manipulation can recover GAR by applying an additive bias $\\beta$ to goal-token attention logits at every layer of the ThreadGate checkpoint during generation.\n\nAn initial sweep on $N$\\,=\\,5 ten-turn conversations (Figure~\\ref{fig:steering}a) reveals a sharp nonlinearity between $\\beta$\\,=\\,2 and $\\beta$\\,=\\,5: GAR increases ${\\sim}$11$\\times$ (0.062\\,$\\to$\\,0.6795$\\pm$0.020) while PPL rises 35\\% (1.41\\,$\\to$\\,1.91). At $\\beta$\\,=\\,10, GAR saturates at 0.959 but PPL degrades to 4.22.\n\n$N$\\,=\\,50 conversations from a held-out evaluation set (39 with $\\geq$3 turns, mean 3.6 user turns; Figure~\\ref{fig:steering}b) confirm the qualitative steering pattern observed in the $N$\\,=\\,5 pilot (10 turns each), with consistent nonlinearity range and saturation behavior. A finer $\\beta$ sweep localizes the nonlinearity: GAR jumps from 0.128$\\pm$0.110 ($\\beta$\\,=\\,2) to 0.556$\\pm$0.060 ($\\beta$\\,=\\,3), an 8.7$\\times$ recovery from baseline with only 9\\% PPL increase (1.43\\,$\\to$\\,1.56), identifying $\\beta$\\,=\\,3 as a practical operating point. The $\\beta$\\,=\\,0 distribution is right-skewed (mean 0.064, median 0.031, std 0.081), driven by short conversations with high baseline GAR; absolute baselines therefore differ from the 10-turn $N$\\,=\\,5 evaluation (0.028). At $\\beta$\\,=\\,5, GAR reaches 0.727$\\pm$0.061 with PPL 1.77$\\pm$0.27, confirming the recovery pattern at scale.\n\nThese results provide constructive evidence that attention misallocation---not representation degradation---is a proximal cause of exposure-bias-induced GAR failure under the tested conditions (Qwen-2.5-7B, UltraChat, GAR-family losses): manually correcting attention via $\\beta$ bias restores GAR, and inference-time intervention circumvents the exposure bias barrier. This steering experiment is diagnostic: it requires identifying goal tokens, trivial for system prompts but not generalizable.\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n  \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{fig5_attention_steering.pdf}\n  \\caption{Inference-time attention steering: additive bias $\\beta$ applied to goal-token attention logits during autoregressive generation (error bars show $\\pm$1\\,std).

    "originalFile": "\\section{Analysis}\\label{sec:analysis}\n\nThe five-way comparison in \\S\\ref{sec:experiments} established that gating produces no measurable benefit over LoRA-only fine-tuning. This section traces the failure through a three-step diagnostic chain: we first show that gates learn behavior opposite to the design intent (\\S\\ref{subsec:gate-conditioning}), then rule out gradient conflict as the explanation through an exclusion experiment (\\S\\ref{subsec:pcgrad}), and finally identify distribution shift as the root cause (\\S\\ref{subsec:dist-shift}). \\S\\ref{subsec:mechanism-specificity} confirms this selectivity with an orthogonal hidden-state metric, and \\S\\ref{subsec:cross-model} confirms the failure generalizes across architecturally distinct LLMs.\n\n\\subsection{Gate Turn Conditioning}\\label{subsec:gate-conditioning}\n\nThe design intent of ThreadGate is to modulate the residual stream more aggressively at late conversation turns, where GAR naturally decays (\\S\\ref{sec:background}). We test whether the learned gates achieve this by comparing gate values at turn~1 (early) and turn~21 (late) across all 28 layers of the trained model.\n\nGAR-Dongre, which averages attention across all response tokens rather than the last-token position, remains uniformly near zero (0.01--0.02) because system-prompt tokens compete with hundreds of context tokens for attention mass, diluting the average below the gate's operating range.\n\nThe gates do the opposite of the design intent. In 27 of 28 layers, the gate value at turn~1 is lower than at turn~21 (Wilcoxon signed-rank test: $p = 3.73 \\times 10^{-8}$, effect size $r = 0.975$). At layer~23, the gate is 0.769 at turn~1 and 0.979 at turn~21; at layer~14, it is 0.747 at turn~1 and 0.928 at turn~21. The pattern is consistent: gates suppress the residual stream more at early turns (where GAR is already high) and become nearly passive at late turns (where intervention is most needed). This inversion has a straightforward explanation. NTP loss pressure is highest at late turns, where the model must predict tokens conditioned on a long context. The NTP gradient pushes gates toward 1.0 to preserve the full sublayer computation, and this pressure is strongest precisely where GAR-based attenuation would be most useful.\n\nThe resulting inference-time gate values range from 0.93 to 0.98 (2--7\\% attenuation), far below what meaningful modulation would require; this explains the convergence with LoRA-only in Table~\\ref{tab:four-way}. Figure~\\ref{fig:gate-shift}(a) visualizes the per-layer gate difference. The inverted turn conditioning raises a natural question: does the NTP-GAR gradient conflict prevent gates from learning the intended behavior? If gradient conflict is the root cause, resolving it should rescue gate conditioning.\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n  \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{fig3_gate_shift.pdf}\n  \\caption{(a)~Gate turn conditioning: per-layer gate values at turn~1 vs turn~21. In 27/28 layers, gates approach 1.0 at late turns, inverting the design intent ($p = 3.73 \\times 10^{-8}$). (b)~Distribution shift: the 20--33$\\times$ TF-AR GAR gap persists across all five variants (TG, +PCGrad, UG, LoRA-only, Base) under our evaluation conditions.}\n  \\label{fig:gate-shift}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\subsection{PCGrad Gradient Conflict Exclusion}\\label{subsec:pcgrad}\n\nThe NTP and GAR gradients point in opposing directions across 68--79\\% of layers throughout training, with mean cosine similarity ranging from $-$0.089 (epoch~0) to $-$0.042 (epoch~2). The NTP gradient magnitude dominates by 7.5--14.7$\\times$. This raises a natural hypothesis: perhaps opposing gradient directions prevent the GAR objective from converging. If so, eliminating direction conflict should prevent the collapse. We test this using PCGrad \\citep{yu2020pcgrad}, which projects the gradient of one task onto the normal plane of the other whenever two task gradients conflict. We apply PCGrad to gate parameters only, scoping our claim to direction conflict; magnitude imbalance \\citep{chen2018gradnorm} and Nash equilibrium violations \\citep{navon2022nash} remain untested.\n\nEliminating direction conflict via PCGrad shifts per-step cosine similarity from consistently negative ($-$0.089) to oscillating around zero ($-$0.15 to $+$0.09), yet all outcomes remain unchanged: IID GAR-ours (0.50 vs 0.50), PPL (2.780 vs 2.784), and autoregressive GAR (0.015 vs 0.016) are indistinguishable (Table~\\ref{tab:four-way}). $\\mathcal{L}_\\text{GAR}$ follows a nearly identical training trajectory and collapses in the same manner (Figure~\\ref{fig:training-pcgrad}b). The exclusion follows by \\emph{modus tollens}: if direction conflict causes the failure, removing it should prevent it; PCGrad removes it; the failure persists; therefore direction conflict is not the cause. Direction conflict is neither necessary (removing it does not rescue GAR) nor sufficient ($\\mathcal{L}_\\text{GAR}$ converges during training despite persistent conflict). The 7.5--14.7$\\times$ NTP magnitude dominance renders directional interference inconsequential. With gradient conflict ruled out, the question narrows: the training dynamics are not the problem (GAR converges under teacher forcing), so the failure must occur at the transition from training to inference.\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n  \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{fig2_training_pcgrad.pdf}\n  \\caption{(a)~Gradient cosine similarity between NTP and GAR objectives. ThreadGate remains consistently negative; +PCGrad oscillates around zero. (b)~IID evaluation outcomes are indistinguishable: eliminating direction conflict changes nothing.}\n  \\label{fig:training-pcgrad}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\subsection{Distribution Shift Analysis}\\label{subsec:dist-shift}\n\nGates are ineffective (\\S\\ref{subsec:gate-conditioning}) and gradient conflict is not the cause (\\S\\ref{subsec:pcgrad}). The TF-AR GAR gap (Table~\\ref{tab:four-way}) persists across all training strategies. GAR-Dongre provides a revealing control: under standard training it remains uniformly low (0.01--0.02) with no distribution gap, so the shift selectively destroys the concentrated last-token attention pattern while leaving diffuse attention unaffected (scheduled sampling breaks this pattern; \\S\\ref{sec:discussion}).\n\nThe mechanism is exposure bias \\citep{bengio2015scheduled,arora2022exposure}: during training, the model conditions on ground-truth prefixes; at inference, on its own outputs. The statistical properties diverge, and the 2--7\\% gate attenuation (\\S\\ref{subsec:gate-conditioning}) cannot compensate. \\citet{he2019exposure} showed that language models exhibit token-level self-recovery from exposure bias, and our PPL results confirm this (Table~\\ref{tab:four-way}). The critical distinction is between primary and auxiliary objectives: NTP is robust because it is the same task at both training and inference time, while GAR optimizes a distributional property of the input prefix that has no counterpart under autoregressive generation. Figure~\\ref{fig:attention-heatmap} confirms teacher-forced GAR-ours remains near $\\tau = 0.5$ (7--8\\% decay, $N$\\,=\\,45), yet autoregressive GAR collapses for all variants (Figure~\\ref{fig:gate-shift}b).\n\n\\subsection{Mechanism Specificity}\\label{subsec:mechanism-specificity}\n\n\\S\\ref{subsec:dist-shift} showed that exposure bias selectively destroys GAR-ours while GAR-Dongre remains unaffected under standard training. We test whether this selectivity extends beyond attention with Turn-level Residual Coherence (TRC), the cosine similarity between hidden states at the last-token position of adjacent assistant turns. For ThreadGate, TF/AR TRC is 0.334/0.332 (gap $+$0.002); for LoRA-only, 0.349/0.411 (gap $-$0.062, reversed). Neither shows a gap comparable to the GAR collapse, confirming that exposure bias disrupts a specific routing behavior (summary-position attention to goal tokens) while leaving internal representations intact.\n\nCross-model evaluation extends this selectivity: GAR-Dongre shows negligible distribution shift on both Llama-3.1-8B (AR/TF ratio 1.002$\\times$) and Qwen-2.5-7B (1.28$\\times$), compared to the order-of-magnitude collapse in GAR-ours (the scheduled sampling experiment in \\S\\ref{sec:discussion} breaks this pattern, with GAR-Dongre rising to 0.353).\n\n\\subsection{Cross-Model Replication}\\label{subsec:cross-model}\n\nTo test whether the failure generalizes, we replicate on Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct \\citep{grattafiori2024llama3} with Base, ThreadGate, and LoRA-only. Phase~1 diagnostics confirm goal attention decay (GAR: 0.026$\\to$0.003 over 10 turns). Teacher-forced GAR-ours ($N$\\,=\\,50) is 0.484 (TG) and 0.481 (LoRA-only); gating contributes zero benefit. We report both mean and median GAR-ours for autoregressive evaluation. The AR distribution is heavy-tailed (CoV\\,$>$\\,100\\%; 5--8\\% of turn-level measurements exhibit sporadic attention spikes), making the median more representative. Median GAR-ours ($N$\\,=\\,20 mid-turn conversations, excluding the first two turns) is 0.018 for both TG and LoRA-only (Base: 0.009), yielding TF-AR gaps of 27$\\times$ and 26$\\times$; mean GAR-ours is 0.043 (TG) and 0.028 (LoRA-only), yielding gaps of 11$\\times$ and 17$\\times$ respectively, as outlier spikes (5\\% of TG turns with GAR\\,$\\geq$\\,0.4) inflate the mean. The TF-AR gap exceeds 25$\\times$ on both architectures, consistent with the exposure bias hypothesis. The gate profile differs---Qwen's minimum at layers~3--4, Llama's at layer~25---yet both converge toward identity under NTP pressure.",

Based on the search results, I found the paper you're looking for. Here's what I found:

"Tell Your Model Where to Attend: Post-hoc Attention Steering for LLMs" is a paper by Q. Zhang, C. Singh, L. Liu, X. Liu, B. Yu, J. Gao, and T. Zhao (2024), and it was published at The Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2024).

The paper introduces PASTA (Post-hoc Attention STeering Approach), a method that allows LLMs to read text with user-specified emphasis marks. PASTA identifies a small subset of attention heads and applies precise attention reweighting on them, directing the model attention to user-specified parts, and like prompting, PASTA is applied at inference time and does not require changing any model parameters.

The motivation for the work is that when interacting with large language models (LLMs), we have a need to steer the model to pay closer attention to user-specified information, e.g., an instruction. The paper can be found on arXiv as paper 2311.02262, with the latest version (v2) updated in October 2024.

The paper exists: "Tell Your Model Where to Attend: Post-hoc Attention Steering for LLMs" by Zhang et al., ICLR 2024, arXiv:2311.02262. This is a real paper.

The Director's Item 10 was: "MR1 — 验证 'Tell Your Model Where to Attend' (Zhang et al. 2024) 是否存在，存在则加入 Related Work"

It exists and is very relevant — it's about post-hoc attention steering for LLMs at inference time, which is directly related to our β-steering experiment. 

Now I need to add this to the bibliography and incorporate it into the related work section, checking first whether it's already been included.

1	\section{Related Work}\label{sec:related}
2	
3	\paragraph{Multi-turn attention degradation.}
4	Recent work has established that LLMs systematically degrade across conversation turns. \citet{laban2025lost} showed that model performance drops on tasks placed in later turns, even when the tasks are identical to earlier ones. \citet{liu2026intent} traced a related failure to intent mismatch, where models progressively shift from the user's original intent as dialogue extends. MT-Bench-101 \citep{bai2024mtbench101} provides fine-grained multi-turn evaluation across 1388 turn-level instances, revealing that capability varies substantially across task categories. \citet{dongre2026attention} established the quantitative foundation for this line of work: they defined the Goal Accessibility Ratio (GAR) and showed that attention to system-prompt goal tokens decays by 27--48\% across turns in 12 models, while residual stream probes retain goal information with AUC\,=\,0.98. We observe a steeper 70.8\% decline on Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct (\S\ref{sec:experiments}). This dissociation between attention collapse and residual persistence motivates our gating intervention. Their work characterizes the phenomenon; ours attempts the first systematic cure and, in doing so, uncovers why lightweight interventions fail to transfer from training to inference.
5	
6	\paragraph{Instruction stability.}
7	\citet{li2024measuring} independently quantified instruction instability in multi-turn dialogs and proposed split-softmax---separating instruction from conversation tokens during attention computation---as an inference-time remedy. Split-softmax restructures the attention mechanism itself and requires no retraining, but cannot address exposure bias in auxiliary losses that depend on training-time optimization. Our work adds systematic diagnosis (five-way controlled comparison + PCGrad exclusion), exposure bias attribution, and training-time mitigation via scheduled sampling; our $\beta$-steering complements split-softmax as an alternative inference-time approach (\S\ref{sec:discussion}).
8	
9	\paragraph{Residual gating and adaptive depth.}
10	ReZero \citep{bachlechner2021rezero} showed that residual scaling shapes optimization dynamics. Subsequent work targets computational efficiency: LayerDrop \citep{fan2020layerdrop}, Mixture-of-Depths \citep{raposo2024mixture}, FlexiDepth \citep{luo2025flexidepth}, and CALM \citep{schuster2022calm}. \citet{gromov2024unreasonable} showed that removing up to half a model's layers preserves most capability, paralleling our finding that LoRA-only matches all gating variants. ThreadGate applies residual gating to a different objective: recovering attention patterns in multi-turn dialogue.
11	
12	\paragraph{Attention manipulation.}
13	StreamingLLM \citep{xiao2024streaming} identified attention sinks and proposed anchor token retention; \citet{hsieh2024found} showed positional bias against middle-positioned information; \citet{qiu2025gated} replaced softmax with a learned gate for sparse attention; Rhea \citep{hong2025rhea} introduces role-aware episodic attention for multi-turn dialogue. These approaches intervene inside the attention mechanism, while ThreadGate operates on the residual stream. Our results suggest that neither pathway alone overcomes the distributional gap between teacher-forced training and autoregressive inference.
14	
15	\paragraph{Multi-task gradient conflict.}
16	GradNorm \citep{chen2018gradnorm}, PCGrad \citep{yu2020pcgrad}, CAGrad \citep{liu2021cagrad}, and Nash-MTL \citep{navon2022nash} treat gradient conflict between competing losses as a root cause to be resolved through better optimization. We repurpose PCGrad as a diagnostic tool: eliminating directional conflict between NTP and GAR gradients does not improve GAR convergence. Gradient conflict is a symptom rather than the cause.
17	
18	\paragraph{Exposure bias.}
19	Teacher forcing creates a distributional mismatch between training and inference that compounds over sequence length \citep{wiseman2016sequence,arora2022exposure}. Scheduled Sampling \citep{bengio2015scheduled} introduced curriculum-based mixing of ground-truth and model-generated tokens. MIXER \citep{ranzato2016sequence} combined token-level and sequence-level objectives, and Professor Forcing \citep{lamb2016professor} used adversarial regularization to align hidden state distributions under both regimes. \citet{he2019exposure} showed that autoregressive models exhibit self-recovery from exposure bias at the token prediction level. SEARNN \citep{leblond2018searnn} proposed locally recurrent search-based training to avoid the mismatch entirely. This literature focuses on generation quality degradation in primary objectives. No prior work examines how exposure bias affects auxiliary objectives that target attention distributions, nor how it manifests in multi-turn dialogue settings. Our work identifies a distinct failure mode: auxiliary attention losses that converge under teacher forcing fail completely under autoregressive generation, even when NTP remains robust, because token-level self-recovery does not extend to distributional properties of attention.

Our results suggest that neither pathway alone overcomes the distributional gap between teacher-forced training and autoregressive inference.\n\n\\paragraph{Multi-task gradient conflict.}\nGradNorm \\citep{chen2018gradnorm}, PCGrad \\citep{yu2020pcgrad}, CAGrad \\citep{liu2021cagrad}, and Nash-MTL \\citep{navon2022nash} treat gradient conflict between competing losses as a root cause to be resolved through better optimization. We repurpose PCGrad as a diagnostic tool: eliminating directional conflict between NTP and GAR gradients does not improve GAR convergence. Gradient conflict is a symptom rather than the cause.\n\n\\paragraph{Exposure bias.}\nTeacher forcing creates a distributional mismatch between training and inference that compounds over sequence length \\citep{wiseman2016sequence,arora2022exposure}. Scheduled Sampling \\citep{bengio2015scheduled} introduced curriculum-based mixing of ground-truth and model-generated tokens. MIXER \\citep{ranzato2016sequence} combined token-level and sequence-level objectives, and Professor Forcing \\citep{lamb2016professor} used adversarial regularization to align hidden state distributions under both regimes. \\citet{he2019exposure} showed that autoregressive models exhibit self-recovery from exposure bias at the token prediction level. SEARNN \\citep{leblond2018searnn} proposed locally recurrent search-based training to avoid the mismatch entirely. This literature focuses on generation quality degradation in primary objectives. No prior work examines how exposure bias affects auxiliary objectives that target attention distributions, nor how it manifests in multi-turn dialogue settings. Our work identifies a distinct failure mode: auxiliary attention losses that converge under teacher forcing fail completely under autoregressive generation, even when NTP remains robust, because token-level self-recovery does not extend to distributional properties of attention.",

```text
Now I need to add Zhang et al. 2024 (PASTA) to the bib and cite it in the related work. It fits best in the "Attention manipulation" paragraph since it's about post-hoc attention steering. It's also directly relevant to our β-steering experiment.

Let me add the bib entry and the citation.

    "originalFile": "\\section{Related Work}\\label{sec:related}\n\n\\paragraph{Multi-turn attention degradation.}\nRecent work has established that LLMs systematically degrade across conversation turns. \\citet{laban2025lost} showed that model performance drops on tasks placed in later turns, even when the tasks are identical to earlier ones. \\citet{liu2026intent} traced a related failure to intent mismatch, where models progressively shift from the user's original intent as dialogue extends. MT-Bench-101 \\citep{bai2024mtbench101} provides fine-grained multi-turn evaluation across 1388 turn-level instances, revealing that capability varies substantially across task categories. \\citet{dongre2026attention} established the quantitative foundation for this line of work: they defined the Goal Accessibility Ratio (GAR) and showed that attention to system-prompt goal tokens decays by 27--48\\% across turns in 12 models, while residual stream probes retain goal information with AUC\\,=\\,0.98. We observe a steeper 70.8\\% decline on Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct (\\S\\ref{sec:experiments}). This dissociation between attention collapse and residual persistence motivates our gating intervention. Their work characterizes the phenomenon; ours attempts the first systematic cure and, in doing so, uncovers why lightweight interventions fail to transfer from training to inference.\n\n\\paragraph{Instruction stability.}\n\\citet{li2024measuring} independently quantified instruction instability in multi-turn dialogs and proposed split-softmax---separating instruction from conversation tokens during attention computation---as an inference-time remedy. Split-softmax restructures the attention mechanism itself and requires no retraining, but cannot address exposure bias in auxiliary losses that depend on training-time optimization. Our work adds systematic diagnosis (five-way controlled comparison + PCGrad exclusion), exposure bias attribution, and training-time mitigation via scheduled sampling; our $\\beta$-steering complements split-softmax as an alternative inference-time approach (\\S\\ref{sec:discussion}).\n\n\\paragraph{Residual gating and adaptive depth.}\nReZero \\citep{bachlechner2021rezero} showed that residual scaling shapes optimization dynamics. Subsequent work targets computational efficiency: LayerDrop \\citep{fan2020layerdrop}, Mixture-of-Depths \\citep{raposo2024mixture}, FlexiDepth \\citep{luo2025flexidepth}, and CALM \\citep{schuster2022calm}. \\citet{gromov2024unreasonable} showed that removing up to half a model's layers preserves most capability, paralleling our finding that LoRA-only matches all gating variants. ThreadGate applies residual gating to a different objective: recovering attention patterns in multi-turn dialogue.\n\n\\paragraph{Attention manipulation.}\nStreamingLLM \\citep{xiao2024streaming} identified attention sinks and proposed anchor token retention; \\citet{hsieh2024found} showed positional bias against middle-positioned information; \\citet{qiu2025gated} replaced softmax with a learned gate for sparse attention; Rhea \\citep{hong2025rhea} introduces role-aware episodic attention for multi-turn dialogue. These approaches intervene inside the attention mechanism, while ThreadGate operates on the residual stream. Our results suggest that neither pathway alone overcomes the distributional gap between teacher-forced training and autoregressive inference.\n\n\\paragraph{Multi-task gradient conflict.}\nGradNorm \\citep{chen2018gradnorm}, PCGrad \\citep{yu2020pcgrad}, CAGrad \\citep{liu2021cagrad}, and Nash-MTL \\citep{navon2022nash} treat gradient conflict between competing losses as a root cause to be resolved through better optimization. We repurpose PCGrad as a diagnostic tool: eliminating directional conflict between NTP and GAR gradients does not improve GAR convergence. Gradient conflict is a symptom rather than the cause.\n\n\\paragraph{Exposure bias.}\nTeacher forcing creates a distributional mismatch between training and inference that compounds over sequence length \\citep{wiseman2016sequence,arora2022exposure}. Scheduled Sampling \\citep{bengio2015scheduled} introduced curriculum-based mixing of ground-truth and model-generated tokens. MIXER \\citep{ranzato2016sequence} combined token-level and sequence-level objectives, and Professor Forcing \\citep{lamb2016professor} used adversarial regularization to align hidden state distributions under both regimes. \\citet{he2019exposure} showed that autoregressive models exhibit self-recovery from exposure bias at the token prediction level. SEARNN \\citep{leblond2018searnn} proposed locally recurrent search-based training to avoid the mismatch entirely. This literature focuses on generation quality degradation in primary objectives. No prior work examines how exposure bias affects auxiliary objectives that target attention distributions, nor how it manifests in multi-turn dialogue settings. Our work identifies a distinct failure mode: auxiliary attention losses that converge under teacher forcing fail completely under autoregressive generation, even when NTP remains robust, because token-level self-recovery does not extend to distributional properties of attention.",

```text
The paper compiles to 14 pages total. But the 8-page limit is for main text only — references, limitations, and appendix don't count. Let me check the PDF to see where each section lands.

Let me look at the preview images to see how the pages are distributed. Pages 1-8 are main text + references start. Let me check pages 8 and 9 to see if main text overflows.

Let me read the page images to check where the main text ends and references/limitations/appendix begin.

```text
Page 8 shows that the Discussion section (§6) starts at the bottom of page 8 and continues. Page 9 shows the Discussion continuing, then Conclusion (§7), then Limitations (§8), then References starting.

So main text overflows to page 9. The Conclusion is on page 9, which means main text (through Conclusion) exceeds 8 pages. Limitations and References start on page 9 too.

I need to compress. The main text sections are: Abstract, Introduction, Related Work, Method, Experiments, Analysis, Discussion, Conclusion. All of these must fit in 8 pages.


Looking at the page breaks, the Discussion section I recently expanded is the biggest problem — those additions around KV cache behavior, instruction retention, and the restructured analysis section added roughly 200 words. The GAR-D explanation in the analysis section added a couple sentences, the Conclusion got expanded by about 3 sentences, and there's the PASTA citation in Related Work. I need to trim roughly half a page to a full page total, so I should focus on cutting back the Discussion section first since that's where most of the new content landed.

The instruction retention paragraph is marked as critical by the Director, so I can't remove it entirely but I can tighten the language. The KV cache paragraph is also important but has more room to compress. The Conclusion expansion is lower priority, so that's a good candidate for cutting back. The Introduction's contributions list is quite dense at about 10 lines, which could be condensed. Let me prioritize: trim the Discussion's KV cache and instruction retention paragraphs, pull back the Conclusion expansion, and see if I can streamline the contributions list without losing the key points. half a column. Plus minor additions elsewhere.

Strategy:
1. Compress the KV cache paragraph (remove some detail)
2. Compress instruction retention paragraph (remove format/count constraint detail)
3. Shorten Conclusion slightly
4. Tighten Introduction contributions

The paper was already at the exact boundary before my edits—there was a previous page overflow issue that took 5 iterations to resolve. So I'm working with a very tight constraint.

My additions total about 250 words net across the paper: roughly 200 words in the Discussion section after restructuring, 40 words in the Analysis section explaining GAR-D, 40 words expanding the Conclusion, 30 words adding the PASTA citation to Related Work, and 30 words of compression in the Abstract. That's about 0.6 of a column, or roughly 0.3 of a page—significant given the space constraints.

Now I need to compress aggressively. For the KV cache framing, I can tighten it to focus on the core argument: that cache drift is better understood as a consequence of exposure bias rather than an independent cause, and that disentangling them would require a switching experiment we're leaving for future work. For instruction retention, I'll strip down the constraint details and just focus on the core evaluation across the different constraint types. Looking at the statistical results, content constraints show substantial improvement with a 23.8 percentage point gain, though overall compliance gains are more modest at 11.1 points. Turn-level GAR correlates meaningfully with compliance, though this remains exploratory given the single model setup.

ThreadGate's core mechanism uses per-layer gated MLPs with an auxiliary GAR loss, and while training-time GAR reaches 0.50, the autoregressive version collapses dramatically across both model architectures. Gating provides no advantage over LoRA alone, and the root cause isn't gradient conflicts but exposure bias—steering recovers performance substantially while scheduled sampling narrows the gap further, pointing to attention misallocation as the underlying issue and suggesting that auxiliary losses need training procedures that bridge the teacher-forcing gap.

For the GAR-D explanation, I should compress it to a single sentence. And I'm also looking at whether the scheduled sampling discussion can be tightened—it currently describes how scheduled sampling mixes teacher-forced and model-generated contexts to address the train-inference mismatch, so I'll see if that can be condensed while keeping the key insight about what it reveals. Scheduled sampling effectively closes the exposure bias gap—boosting performance by 20× with minimal perplexity cost—though it requires retraining, unlike inference-time methods.

Now I'm mapping out the page layout to figure out how much content needs to shift between pages to fit everything properly.

EMNLP 2026 allows 8 pages for the main text, with Limitations and References unlimited, so I need to get everything through Conclusion onto page 8. Looking at what's currently on page 9, I have most of the Discussion section plus the entire Conclusion taking up about 0.6-0.7 of a page that needs to move back.

I'm weighing my options: I could aggressively compress the Discussion section, drastically shorten the Conclusion to just a few sentences, or restructure how the instruction retention content is presented. The tightest approach would be combining aggressive compression of Discussion with a minimal Conclusion.

Given the Director's priorities—instruction retention is marked Critical and needs to stay in the main text, exposure bias expansion is high priority, and conclusion expansion is medium priority—I should sacrifice the Conclusion expansion and keep it brief. I'll compress the KV cache and semantic shift paragraphs significantly, make instruction retention very concise at just 3 sentences, and remove the β tradeoff comparison since it's already covered in section 4.3. Let me also scan the other sections for additional compression opportunities.

The GAR-D addition to section 5.1 is only about 35 words and isn't the main culprit for overflow, but I can still tighten that sentence. Instead of the full explanation about system-prompt tokens competing with context tokens and diluting attention mass, I'll compress it to just say GAR-Dongre stays near zero because system-prompt tokens compete with hundreds of context tokens for attention mass. Now I'm mapping out all the compression edits I need to make across the Discussion section and beyond. incompatibility between teacher-forcing and GAR-family auxiliary losses, not to the gating architecture. NTP gradient pressure (7.5--14.7$\times$ the GAR magnitude) pushes gates toward identity (2--7\% attenuation). Inference-time steering ($\beta$\,=\,5) recovers GAR from 0.064 to 0.727, providing constructive evidence that attention misallocation is a proximal cause (\S\ref{subsec:steering}). Split-softmax \citep{li2024measuring} and Rhea \citep{hong2025rhea} complement $\beta$-steering by restructuring attention computation, but cannot resolve exposure bias in auxiliary losses requiring retraining.

Scheduled sampling directly mixes teacher-forced and model-generated contexts during training, and the results are striking: AR GAR-ours jumps from 0.016 to 0.318 (a 20$\times$ improvement), compressing the massive ${\sim}$31$\times$ gap down to just 1.57$\times$ with virtually no change in perplexity. A second seed confirms this with AR GAR reaching 0.418, and GAR-Dongre similarly improves from 0.019 to 0.353. This directly implicates exposure bias as the dominant factor driving the train-inference mismatch. KV cache drift—the divergence of model-generated key-value states from teacher-forced statistics—appears to be a downstream consequence of exposure bias rather than an independent cause, with the prefix mismatch being upstream and cache drift one of several mechanisms through which it manifests.

To properly disentangle these two effects, I'd need to run a switching experiment where the prefix uses teacher-forcing while the continuation is autoregressive, but that's something to explore later. Looking at instruction compliance, the evaluation across 18 constraint types shows content constraint compliance jumping from 61.9% to 85.7% when GAR improves, with overall late-turn compliance gaining 11.1 percentage points. Turn-level GAR correlates with compliance, though format and count constraints remain unchanged, suggesting GAR specifically affects content-dependent instructions rather than structural ones. This analysis is preliminary given it's a single model and single beta value, but the pattern is clear.

I'm now moving into the TRC analysis section.

To properly disentangle these effects, I'd need a switching experiment where the prefix stays teacher-forced while the continuation goes autoregressive, but that's deferred. Instruction compliance evaluation shows content constraints improving substantially when GAR increases, with turn-level GAR correlating with compliance specifically for content-dependent instructions rather than format or count constraints. The TRC analysis comes next. Training with teacher forcing achieves the target GAR of 0.50, but switching to autoregressive decoding causes a catastrophic collapse of over 25 times on both models—gating provides no advantage over LoRA alone. The root cause isn't gradient conflicts or the gating mechanism itself, but exposure bias. When I apply steering and scheduled sampling to close the train-test gap, GAR improves dramatically to 0.727, and the scheduled sampling variant reduces the gap from 31× down to 1.57×, pointing to attention misallocation as the real problem and suggesting that auxiliary attention losses need training procedures that bridge the teacher-forcing gap.

Now I'm deciding whether to keep the PASTA reference in related work since the Director requested it, though I should tighten the wording. Let me focus on the Discussion compression first since that's where the biggest savings are, then recompile to see if we're still over the page limit.

    "originalFile": "\\section{Analysis}\\label{sec:analysis}\n\nThe five-way comparison in \\S\\ref{sec:experiments} established that gating produces no measurable benefit over LoRA-only fine-tuning. This section traces the failure through a three-step diagnostic chain: we first show that gates learn behavior opposite to the design intent (\\S\\ref{subsec:gate-conditioning}), then rule out gradient conflict as the explanation through an exclusion experiment (\\S\\ref{subsec:pcgrad}), and finally identify distribution shift as the root cause (\\S\\ref{subsec:dist-shift}). \\S\\ref{subsec:mechanism-specificity} confirms this selectivity with an orthogonal hidden-state metric, and \\S\\ref{subsec:cross-model} confirms the failure generalizes across architecturally distinct LLMs.\n\n\\subsection{Gate Turn Conditioning}\\label{subsec:gate-conditioning}\n\nThe design intent of ThreadGate is to modulate the residual stream more aggressively at late conversation turns, where GAR naturally decays (\\S\\ref{sec:background}). We test whether the learned gates achieve this by comparing gate values at turn~1 (early) and turn~21 (late) across all 28 layers of the trained model.\n\nGAR-Dongre, which averages attention across all response tokens rather than the last-token position, remains uniformly near zero (0.01--0.02) because system-prompt tokens compete with hundreds of context tokens for attention mass, diluting the average below the gate's operating range.\n\nThe gates do the opposite of the design intent. In 27 of 28 layers, the gate value at turn~1 is lower than at turn~21 (Wilcoxon signed-rank test: $p = 3.73 \\times 10^{-8}$, effect size $r = 0.975$). At layer~23, the gate is 0.769 at turn~1 and 0.979 at turn~21; at layer~14, it is 0.747 at turn~1 and 0.928 at turn~21. The pattern is consistent: gates suppress the residual stream more at early turns (where GAR is already high) and become nearly passive at late turns (where intervention is most needed). This inversion has a straightforward explanation. NTP loss pressure is highest at late turns, where the model must predict tokens conditioned on a long context. The NTP gradient pushes gates toward 1.0 to preserve the full sublayer computation, and this pressure is strongest precisely where GAR-based attenuation would be most useful.\n\nThe resulting inference-time gate values range from 0.93 to 0.98 (2--7\\% attenuation), far below what meaningful modulation would require; this explains the convergence with LoRA-only in Table~\\ref{tab:four-way}. Figure~\\ref{fig:gate-shift}(a) visualizes the per-layer gate difference. The inverted turn conditioning raises a natural question: does the NTP-GAR gradient conflict prevent gates from learning the intended behavior? If gradient conflict is the root cause, resolving it should rescue gate conditioning.\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n  \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{fig3_gate_shift.pdf}\n  \\caption{(a)~Gate turn conditioning: per-layer gate values at turn~1 vs turn~21. In 27/28 layers, gates approach 1.0 at late turns, inverting the design intent ($p = 3.73 \\times 10^{-8}$). (b)~Distribution shift: the TF-AR GAR gap persists across all five variants (TG, +PCGrad, UG, LoRA-only, Base) under our evaluation conditions.}\n  \\label{fig:gate-shift}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\subsection{PCGrad Gradient Conflict Exclusion}\\label{subsec:pcgrad}\n\nThe NTP and GAR gradients point in opposing directions across 68--79\\% of layers throughout training, with mean cosine similarity ranging from $-$0.089 (epoch~0) to $-$0.042 (epoch~2). The NTP gradient magnitude dominates by 7.5--14.7$\\times$. This raises a natural hypothesis: perhaps opposing gradient directions prevent the GAR objective from converging. If so, eliminating direction conflict should prevent the collapse. We test this using PCGrad \\citep{yu2020pcgrad}, which projects the gradient of one task onto the normal plane of the other whenever two task gradients conflict. We apply PCGrad to gate parameters only, scoping our claim to direction conflict; magnitude imbalance \\citep{chen2018gradnorm} and Nash equilibrium violations \\citep{navon2022nash} remain untested.\n\nEliminating direction conflict via PCGrad shifts per-step cosine similarity from consistently negative ($-$0.089) to oscillating around zero ($-$0.15 to $+$0.09), yet all outcomes remain unchanged: IID GAR-ours (0.50 vs 0.50), PPL (2.780 vs 2.784), and autoregressive GAR (0.015 vs 0.016) are indistinguishable (Table~\\ref{tab:four-way}). $\\mathcal{L}_\\text{GAR}$ follows a nearly identical training trajectory and collapses in the same manner (Figure~\\ref{fig:training-pcgrad}b). The exclusion follows by \\emph{modus tollens}: if direction conflict causes the failure, removing it should prevent it; PCGrad removes it; the failure persists; therefore direction conflict is not the cause. Direction conflict is neither necessary (removing it does not rescue GAR) nor sufficient ($\\mathcal{L}_\\text{GAR}$ converges during training despite persistent conflict). The 7.5--14.7$\\times$ NTP magnitude dominance renders directional interference inconsequential. With gradient conflict ruled out, the question narrows: the training dynamics are not the problem (GAR converges under teacher forcing), so the failure must occur at the transition from training to inference.\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n  \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{fig2_training_pcgrad.pdf}\n  \\caption{(a)~Gradient cosine similarity between NTP and GAR objectives. ThreadGate remains consistently negative; +PCGrad oscillates around zero. (b)~IID evaluation outcomes are indistinguishable: eliminating direction conflict changes nothing.}\n  \\label{fig:training-pcgrad}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\subsection{Distribution Shift Analysis}\\label{subsec:dist-shift}\n\nGates are ineffective (\\S\\ref{subsec:gate-conditioning}) and gradient conflict is not the cause (\\S\\ref{subsec:pcgrad}). The TF-AR GAR gap (Table~\\ref{tab:four-way}) persists across all training strategies. GAR-Dongre provides a revealing control: under standard training it remains uniformly low (0.01--0.02) with no distribution gap, so the shift selectively destroys the concentrated last-token attention pattern while leaving diffuse attention unaffected (scheduled sampling breaks this pattern; \\S\\ref{sec:discussion}).\n\nThe mechanism is exposure bias \\citep{bengio2015scheduled,arora2022exposure}: during training, the model conditions on ground-truth prefixes; at inference, on its own outputs. The statistical properties diverge, and the 2--7\\% gate attenuation (\\S\\ref{subsec:gate-conditioning}) cannot compensate. \\citet{he2019exposure} showed that language models exhibit token-level self-recovery from exposure bias, and our PPL results confirm this (Table~\\ref{tab:four-way}). The critical distinction is between primary and auxiliary objectives: NTP is robust because it is the same task at both training and inference time, while GAR optimizes a distributional property of the input prefix that has no counterpart under autoregressive generation. Figure~\\ref{fig:attention-heatmap} confirms teacher-forced GAR-ours remains near $\\tau = 0.5$ (7--8\\% decay, $N$\\,=\\,45), yet autoregressive GAR collapses for all variants (Figure~\\ref{fig:gate-shift}b).\n\n\\subsection{Mechanism Specificity}\\label{subsec:mechanism-specificity}\n\n\\S\\ref{subsec:dist-shift} showed that exposure bias selectively destroys GAR-ours while GAR-Dongre remains unaffected under standard training. We test whether this selectivity extends beyond attention with Turn-level Residual Coherence (TRC), the cosine similarity between hidden states at the last-token position of adjacent assistant turns. For ThreadGate, TF/AR TRC is 0.334/0.332 (gap $+$0.002); for LoRA-only, 0.349/0.411 (gap $-$0.062, reversed). Neither shows a gap comparable to the GAR collapse, confirming that exposure bias disrupts a specific routing behavior (summary-position attention to goal tokens) while leaving internal representations intact.\n\nCross-model evaluation extends this selectivity: GAR-Dongre shows negligible distribution shift on both Llama-3.1-8B (AR/TF ratio 1.002$\\times$) and Qwen-2.5-7B (1.28$\\times$), compared to the order-of-magnitude collapse in GAR-ours (the scheduled sampling experiment in \\S\\ref{sec:discussion} breaks this pattern, with GAR-Dongre rising to 0.353).\n\n\\subsection{Cross-Model Replication}\\label{subsec:cross-model}\n\nTo test whether the failure generalizes, we replicate on Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct \\citep{grattafiori2024llama3} with Base, ThreadGate, and LoRA-only. Phase~1 diagnostics confirm goal attention decay (GAR: 0.026$\\to$0.003 over 10 turns). Teacher-forced GAR-ours ($N$\\,=\\,50) is 0.484 (TG) and 0.481 (LoRA-only); gating contributes zero benefit. We report both mean and median GAR-ours for autoregressive evaluation. The AR distribution is heavy-tailed (CoV\\,$>$\\,100\\%; 5--8\\% of turn-level measurements exhibit sporadic attention spikes), making the median more representative. Median GAR-ours ($N$\\,=\\,20 mid-turn conversations, excluding the first two turns) is 0.018 for both TG and LoRA-only (Base: 0.009), yielding TF-AR gaps of 27$\\times$ and 26$\\times$; mean GAR-ours is 0.043 (TG) and 0.028 (LoRA-only), yielding gaps of 11$\\times$ and 17$\\times$ respectively, as outlier spikes (5\\% of TG turns with GAR\\,$\\geq$\\,0.4) inflate the mean. The TF-AR gap exceeds 25$\\times$ on both architectures, consistent with the exposure bias hypothesis. The gate profile differs---Qwen's minimum at layers~3--4, Llama's at layer~25---yet both converge toward identity under NTP pressure.",

          " ",
          "-GAR-Dongre, which averages attention across all response tokens rather than the last-token position, remains uniformly near zero (0.01--0.02) because system-prompt tokens compete with hundreds of context tokens for attention mass, diluting the average below the gate's operating range.",

          " ",
          " The gates do the opposite of the design intent. In 27 of 28 layers, the gate value at turn~1 is lower than at turn~21 (Wilcoxon signed-rank test: $p = 3.73 \\times 10^{-8}$, effect size $r = 0.975$). At layer~23, the gate is 0.769 at turn~1 and 0.979 at turn~21; at layer~14, it is 0.747 at turn~1 and 0.928 at turn~21. The pattern is consistent: gates suppress the residual stream more at early turns (where GAR is already high) and become nearly passive at late turns (where intervention is most needed). This inversion has a straightforward explanation. NTP loss pressure is highest at late turns, where the model must predict tokens conditioned on a long context. The NTP gradient pushes gates toward 1.0 to preserve the full sublayer computation, and this pressure is strongest precisely where GAR-based attenuation would be most useful.",

```text
Still 14 pages total. But the total page count includes references, limitations, and appendix which are unlimited. The check is counting total pages as 14. I need to see where main text ends. Let me render pages 8-9 to check if main text now fits within 8 pages.

Actually, the `max_pages` check appears to be checking total pages including references/appendix, which is wrong for EMNLP. 14 pages total is expected (8 main + ~1 limitations + ~4 references + appendix). Let me check page 8 and 9 to see if main text (through Conclusion) fits on page 8.

```text
Looking at page 8: The Discussion section (§6) starts on page 8 and continues. The content visible on page 8 includes:
- §5.4 Mechanism Specificity
- §5.5 Cross-Model Replication
- §6 Discussion (starts, includes opening paragraph, scheduled sampling paragraph, KV cache paragraph, GAR and downstream instruction compliance paragraph, TRC scoping paragraph)

Wait, looking more carefully at page 8, I can see the Discussion section starts and the content seems to go all the way to the bottom. Let me see what's on page 9.

Page 9 shows:


- The end of the Discussion's scoping paragraph about GAR losses on Qwen-2.5-7B
- §7 Conclusion
- §8 Limitations
- References begin

So the Discussion wraps onto page 9, and the Conclusion is also there. I need to cut about 10-15 lines to get the Conclusion to fit on page 8. Looking at what I can compress, the scoping paragraph at the end of Discussion seems like a good target—I can tighten up the TRC analysis explanation and reduce some of the redundancy there.

The Conclusion itself is about 4 sentences, so I could trim it to 3 without losing the main message. I should also scan the Discussion paragraphs for any other places where I can compress language or remove tangential details. Let me estimate the page space: roughly 2 lines of Discussion overflow, plus the Conclusion header and its content takes up about 5 lines, so I'm looking at needing to save around 7-10 lines total to get everything to fit properly on page 8.

I can tackle this in a few ways. First, I could remove the scoping paragraph from Discussion since that information is already covered in the Limitations section. That saves about 2 lines. Second, I could compress the Conclusion down to 2-3 short sentences instead of 4, saving another 2 lines. That gets me to 4 lines saved, but I still need 3-4 more.

Looking at other sections, I could compress the IR paragraph further, trim the opening paragraph of Discussion, and remove the sentence about Split-softmax and Rhea since that's already mentioned in Related Work. Let me start with those targeted cuts.

I'll remove the Split-softmax and Rhea sentence from the Discussion opening, take out the TRC/scoping paragraph from the end of Discussion, and compress the Conclusion. That should save about 5-6 lines total. I should also check the Introduction more carefully—the contribution list is quite dense, so compressing contribution (4) might free up another line.

Let me start making these edits now.

NTP gradient pressure (7.5--14.7$\times$ the GAR magnitude) pushes gates toward identity (2--7\% attenuation). Inference-time steering ($\beta$\,=\,5) recovers GAR from 0.064 to 0.727, providing constructive evidence that attention misallocation is a proximal cause (\S\ref{subsec:steering}).

AR GAR-ours increases from 0.016 to 0.318 (20$\times$), compressing the ${\sim}$31$\times$ gap to 1.57$\times$ with negligible PPL change (1.38 vs.\ 1.36); a second seed yields AR GAR\,=\,0.418 (gap 1.20$\times$).

7	\paragraph{KV cache drift as a downstream mechanism.} KV cache drift---accumulation of model-generated key-value states diverging from teacher-forced statistics---is better understood as a downstream consequence of exposure bias than an independent cause: the prefix mismatch is upstream, and cache drift is one mechanism through which it propagates. Disentangling the two requires a switching experiment (teacher-forced prefix followed by autoregressive continuation); we leave this to future work.

Turn-level GAR correlates with compliance ($r$\,=\,0.200, $p$\,=\,0.007), while format and count constraints show no change, consistent with GAR specifically affecting content-dependent instructions (Appendix~\ref{sec:appendix-ir}).

And page 9 shows: "both Qwen-2.5-7B and Llama-3.1-8B; gating adds zero benefit over LoRA-only. Steering (β = 5, GAR 0.727) and scheduled sampling (gap 31×→1.57×; single seed) implicate attention misallocation as the proximal cause."
 
I need to trim about 2-3 lines to fit the entire Conclusion on page 8. I'm weighing whether to condense the Conclusion itself to two sentences or find space elsewhere on the page. The current Conclusion text spans three sentences, so cutting it down would be the most direct approach. Looking at the instruction compliance results across different constraint types, I'm seeing that content constraint compliance improves substantially from 61.9% to 85.7% with the steering approach, and there's a meaningful correlation between turn-level GAR and compliance rates, though format and count constraints show different patterns. I'm going to tighten up the Conclusion by merging some of the sentences together—combining related ideas to reduce redundancy while keeping the key findings intact.

Almost there — Conclusion starts at bottom of page 8 but last 2 lines overflow to page 9. Need ~3 more lines of savings.

Looking at page 8: The Conclusion (§7) now starts at the very bottom of page 8, and the last line visible is "only. Steering (β = 5, GAR 0.727) and scheduled"

Page 9 starts with: "sampling (gap 31 × →1.57×; single seed) implicate attention misallocation as the proximal cause." Then Limitations starts.

So just 1.5 lines of Conclusion overflow to page 9. I need to save about 2 more lines to get the Conclusion fully on page 8.


The Conclusion currently describes ThreadGate's architecture with gated MLP networks and auxiliary loss, notes that training works for teacher forcing but autoregressive generation fails dramatically on both model variants with no improvement over LoRA baseline, then points to steering and scheduled sampling experiments as evidence that attention misallocation is the core issue. This is already compressed, but I could trim some of the technical specifics or combine related findings more tightly.

Looking at the rest of page 8, I notice the KV cache section has room to compress. The current explanation about cache drift being downstream of exposure bias rather than independent could be shortened—the key insight is that the prefix mismatch is upstream and cache drift is just one propagation mechanism, which I can state more directly. I should also check if the Discussion section has any redundancy I can eliminate to free up space. , GAR 0.727) and scheduled sampling (gap 31×→1.57×; single seed) both point to attention misallocation as the root issue.

I'm trying to trim the paper by removing some redundant phrases—dropping "to the residual stream" and reconsidering whether to keep "with zero benefit over LoRA-only" since that's actually an important result. Looking at the cross-model section on page 8, there's room to compress. I'll target two specific cuts: streamlining the KV cache explanation and shortening the model names in the conclusion, then recompile to see if I can free up space.

    "content": "- update-config: Use this skill to configure the Claude Code harness via settings.json. Automated behaviors (\"from now on when X\", \"each time X\", \"whenever X\", \"before/after X\") require hooks configured in settings.json - the harness executes these, not Claude, so memory/preferences cannot fulfill them. Also use for: permissions (\"allow X\", \"add permission\", \"move permission to\"), env vars (\"set X=Y\"), hook troubleshooting, or any changes to settings.json/settings.local.json files. Examples: \"allow npm commands\", \"add bq permission to global settings\", \"move permission to user settings\", \"set DEBUG=true\", \"when claude stops show X\". For simple settings like theme/model, suggest the /config command.\n- keybindings-help: Use when the user wants to customize keyboard shortcuts, rebind keys, add chord bindings, or modify ~/.claude/keybindings.json. Examples: \"rebind ctrl+s\", \"add a chord shortcut\", \"change the submit key\", \"customize keybindings\".\n- simplify: Review changed code for reuse, quality, and efficiency, then fix any issues found.\n- fewer-permission-prompts: Scan your transcripts for common read-only Bash and MCP tool calls, then add a prioritized allowlist to project .claude/settings.json to reduce permission prompts.\n- loop: Run a prompt or slash command on a recurring interval (e.g. /loop 5m /foo). Omit the interval to let the model self-pace. - When the user wants to set up a recurring task, poll for status, or run something repeatedly on an interval (e.g. \"check the deploy every 5 minutes\", \"keep running /babysit-prs\"). Do NOT invoke for one-off tasks.\n- schedule: Create, update, list, or run scheduled remote agents (routines) that execute on a cron schedule. - When the user wants to schedule a recurring remote agent, set up automated tasks, create a cron job for Claude Code, or manage their scheduled agents/routines. Also use when the user wants a one-time scheduled run (\"run this once at 3pm\", \"remind me to check X tomorrow\").\n- claude-api: Build, debug, and optimize Claude API / Anthropic SDK apps. Apps built with this skill should include prompt caching. Also handles migrating existing Claude API code between Claude model versions (4.5 → 4.6, 4.6 → 4.7, retired-model replacements).\nTRIGGER when: code imports `anthropic`/`@anthropic-ai/sdk`; user asks for the Claude API, Anthropic SDK, or Managed Agents; user adds/modifies/tunes a Claude feature (caching, thinking, compaction, tool use, batch, files, citations, memory) or model (Opus/Sonnet/Haiku) in a file; questions about prompt caching / cache hit rate in an Anthropic SDK project.\nSKIP: file imports `openai`/other-provider SDK, filename like `*-openai.py`/`*-generic.py`, provider-neutral code, general programming/ML.\n- init: Initialize a new CLAUDE.md file with codebase documentation\n- review: Review a pull request\n- security-review: Complete a security review of the pending changes on the current branch",

```text
This is the FALSE system reminder again — Paper Agent uses `paper_agent_post_to_director`, not `main_agent_post_to_director`. I should ignore this false alert and continue working.

Let me check where I left off. The compile succeeded with 13 pages total. I need to verify that the main text (through Conclusion) fits on page 8 by checking the rendered pages. Let me also verify that the compression didn't drop the page count too much — 13 pages instead of 14 means one appendix page was absorbed, which is fine.

Let me check pages 8 and 9 to confirm main text ends on page 8.

Page 8 now shows:
- §5.4 Mechanism Specificity
- §5.5 Cross-Model Replication
- §6 Discussion (full, with all 4 paragraphs)
- §7 Conclusion (full, ending with "allocation as the proximal cause.")

All main text fits on page 8!

Page 9 starts with §8 Limitations, then References. This is correct — Limitations, References, and Appendix are unlimited.

The main text (Abstract through Conclusion) fits within 8 pages. 


Compilation passes with no critical warnings, and the document is now 13 pages total with 8 pages for the main content and 5 unlimited pages. Let me verify the final state of all edits and check what's been completed in this session.

All items are now complete: the critical instruction retention paragraph has been added to the Discussion section, the Discussion itself has been expanded with three structured subsections covering semantic similarity, KV cache behavior, and instruction retention, number deduplication has reduced key metrics from multiple occurrences down to just a few, the Abstract has been trimmed from roughly 180 words to 150, and the Conclusion has received a slight expansion. Previous session work on the title, section 5.5, citation formatting, and phrase removals all remain in place.

I've verified the Zhang et al. 2024 ICLR paper on attention mechanisms and added it to both the bibliography and Related Work section, plus incorporated a one-sentence explanation of GAR-D into section 5.1. Figure improvements were deprioritized due to page constraints, but the manuscript compiles without critical warnings and fits cleanly within the 8-page limit.

Time to notify the Director that all revisions are complete.

1. **泛化性**：合并 seed 验证不足 + 仅两个模型家族 + 单数据集 + instruction retention 探索性
2. **辅助 loss 设计空间**：合并"仅一种辅助 loss (GAR MSE)" + "所有变体共享 GAR loss"
3. **诊断深度**：PCGrad 只排除梯度方向冲突（magnitude imbalance 未排除），或训练规模（8K）—— 选一个

写成一段连贯短文，不要用 bullet points 或编号列表。确保修改后主文仍 ≤8 页。

1	\section{Limitations}\label{sec:limitations}
2	
3	The five-way comparison uses seed\,=\,42; ThreadGate is additionally validated with seed\,=\,123 (TF/AR GAR-ours within $\pm$0.001, gap 30.5--32.1$\times$). The remaining three variants use a single seed; cross-variant convergence provides indirect robustness evidence but does not substitute for multi-seed validation.
4	
5	We test only one type of auxiliary attention loss (GAR with MSE target $\tau = 0.5$). Other attention steering objectives, such as head-specific or layer-specific attention losses, may exhibit different sensitivity to exposure bias. Our negative result applies to the GAR family; it does not rule out all auxiliary attention interventions.
6	
7	Training uses 8K conversations from UltraChat. Larger-scale training could alter gate dynamics, particularly if the model encounters sufficient distributional diversity to reduce the training-inference mismatch.
8	
9	All experiments use two model families (Qwen-2.5-7B and Llama-3.1-8B); while cross-model evaluation confirms the exposure bias gap, $N$\,=\,2 does not establish universality. The Llama evaluation includes ThreadGate and LoRA-only; the full five-way ablation (Uniform Gate, +PCGrad) has not been replicated, and all experiments use a single dataset (UltraChat). The instruction retention analysis is exploratory: a single model, 18 system-prompt constraint types, and a single $\beta$ value without grid search.
10	
11	The PCGrad exclusion experiment addresses gradient direction conflict only. Magnitude imbalance (GradNorm; \citealp{chen2018gradnorm}) and Nash equilibrium approaches (Nash-MTL; \citealp{navon2022nash}) remain untested and could reveal additional failure modes or interaction effects.
12	
13	All four fine-tuned variants share the same GAR auxiliary loss. This design isolates the gating mechanism but does not test whether gating could be effective without an auxiliary attention loss or under a different training objective.

1	\section{Related Work}\label{sec:related}
2	
3	\paragraph{Multi-turn attention degradation.}
4	Recent work has established that LLMs systematically degrade across conversation turns. \citet{laban2025lost} showed that model performance drops on tasks placed in later turns, even when the tasks are identical to earlier ones. \citet{liu2026intent} traced a related failure to intent mismatch, where models progressively shift from the user's original intent as dialogue extends. MT-Bench-101 \citep{bai2024mtbench101} provides fine-grained multi-turn evaluation across 1388 turn-level instances, revealing that capability varies substantially across task categories. \citet{dongre2026attention} established the quantitative foundation for this line of work: they defined the Goal Accessibility Ratio (GAR) and showed that attention to system-prompt goal tokens decays by 27--48\% across turns in 12 models, while residual stream probes retain goal information with AUC\,=\,0.98. We observe a steeper 70.8\% decline on Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct (\S\ref{sec:experiments}). This dissociation between attention collapse and residual persistence motivates our gating intervention. Their work characterizes the phenomenon; ours attempts the first systematic cure and, in doing so, uncovers why lightweight interventions fail to transfer from training to inference.
5	
6	\paragraph{Instruction stability.}
7	\citet{li2024measuring} independently quantified instruction instability in multi-turn dialogs and proposed split-softmax---separating instruction from conversation tokens during attention computation---as an inference-time remedy. Split-softmax restructures the attention mechanism itself and requires no retraining, but cannot address exposure bias in auxiliary losses that depend on training-time optimization. Our work adds systematic diagnosis (five-way controlled comparison + PCGrad exclusion), exposure bias attribution, and training-time mitigation via scheduled sampling; our $\beta$-steering complements split-softmax as an alternative inference-time approach (\S\ref{sec:discussion}).
8	
9	\paragraph{Residual gating and adaptive depth.}
10	ReZero \citep{bachlechner2021rezero} showed that residual scaling shapes optimization dynamics. Subsequent work targets computational efficiency: LayerDrop \citep{fan2020layerdrop}, Mixture-of-Depths \citep{raposo2024mixture}, FlexiDepth \citep{luo2025flexidepth}, and CALM \citep{schuster2022calm}. \citet{gromov2024unreasonable} showed that removing up to half a model's layers preserves most capability, paralleling our finding that LoRA-only matches all gating variants. ThreadGate applies residual gating to a different objective: recovering attention patterns in multi-turn dialogue.
11	
12	\paragraph{Attention manipulation.}
13	StreamingLLM \citep{xiao2024streaming} identified attention sinks and proposed anchor token retention; \citet{hsieh2024found} showed positional bias against middle-positioned information; \citet{qiu2025gated} replaced softmax with a learned gate for sparse attention; Rhea \citep{hong2025rhea} introduces role-aware episodic attention for multi-turn dialogue. PASTA \citep{zhang2024tell} steers attention post-hoc by reweighting a subset of attention heads toward user-specified tokens; our $\beta$-steering applies a simpler additive bias to all layers but serves a diagnostic rather than deployment purpose. These approaches intervene inside the attention mechanism, while ThreadGate operates on the residual stream. Our results suggest that neither pathway alone overcomes the distributional gap between teacher-forced training and autoregressive inference.
14	
15	\paragraph{Multi-task gradient conflict.}
16	GradNorm \citep{chen2018gradnorm}, PCGrad \citep{yu2020pcgrad}, CAGrad \citep{liu2021cagrad}, and Nash-MTL \citep{navon2022nash} treat gradient conflict between competing losses as a root cause to be resolved through better optimization. We repurpose PCGrad as a diagnostic tool: eliminating directional conflict between NTP and GAR gradients does not improve GAR convergence. Gradient conflict is a symptom rather than the cause.
17	
18	\paragraph{Exposure bias.}
19	Teacher forcing creates a distributional mismatch between training and inference that compounds over sequence length \citep{wiseman2016sequence,arora2022exposure}. Scheduled Sampling \citep{bengio2015scheduled} introduced curriculum-based mixing of ground-truth and model-generated tokens. MIXER \citep{ranzato2016sequence} combined token-level and sequence-level objectives, and Professor Forcing \citep{lamb2016professor} used adversarial regularization to align hidden state distributions under both regimes. \citet{he2019exposure} showed that autoregressive models exhibit self-recovery from exposure bias at the token prediction level. SEARNN \citep{leblond2018searnn} proposed locally recurrent search-based training to avoid the mismatch entirely. This literature focuses on generation quality degradation in primary objectives. No prior work examines how exposure bias affects auxiliary objectives that target attention distributions, nor how it manifests in multi-turn dialogue settings. Our work identifies a distinct failure mode: auxiliary attention losses that converge under teacher forcing fail completely under autoregressive generation, even when NTP remains robust, because token-level self-recovery does not extend to distributional properties of attention.

Subsequent work targets computational efficiency: LayerDrop \\citep{fan2020layerdrop}, Mixture-of-Depths \\citep{raposo2024mixture}, FlexiDepth \\citep{luo2025flexidepth}, and CALM \\citep{schuster2022calm}. \\citet{gromov2024unreasonable} showed that removing up to half a model's layers preserves most capability, paralleling our finding that LoRA-only matches all gating variants. ThreadGate applies residual gating to a different objective: recovering attention patterns in multi-turn dialogue.\n\n\\paragraph{Attention manipulation.}\nStreamingLLM \\citep{xiao2024streaming} identified attention sinks and proposed anchor token retention; \\citet{hsieh2024found} showed positional bias against middle-positioned information; \\citet{qiu2025gated} replaced softmax with a learned gate for sparse attention; Rhea \\citep{hong2025rhea} introduces role-aware episodic attention for multi-turn dialogue. PASTA \\citep{zhang2024tell} steers attention post-hoc by reweighting a subset of attention heads toward user-specified tokens; our $\\beta$-steering applies a simpler additive bias to all layers but serves a diagnostic rather than deployment purpose. These approaches intervene inside the attention mechanism, while ThreadGate operates on the residual stream. Our results suggest that neither pathway alone overcomes the distributional gap between teacher-forced training and autoregressive inference.\n\n\\paragraph{Multi-task gradient conflict.}\nGradNorm \\citep{chen2018gradnorm}, PCGrad \\citep{yu2020pcgrad}, CAGrad \\citep{liu2021cagrad}, and Nash-MTL \\citep{navon2022nash} treat gradient conflict between competing losses as a root cause to be resolved through better optimization. We repurpose PCGrad as a diagnostic tool: eliminating directional conflict between NTP and GAR gradients does not improve GAR convergence. Gradient conflict is a symptom rather than the cause.\n\n\\paragraph{Exposure bias.}\nTeacher forcing creates a distributional mismatch between training and inference that compounds over sequence length \\citep{wiseman2016sequence,arora2022exposure}. Scheduled Sampling \\citep{bengio2015scheduled} introduced curriculum-based mixing of ground-truth and model-generated tokens. MIXER \\citep{ranzato2016sequence} combined token-level and sequence-level objectives, and Professor Forcing \\citep{lamb2016professor} used adversarial regularization to align hidden state distributions under both regimes. \\citet{he2019exposure} showed that autoregressive models exhibit self-recovery from exposure bias at the token prediction level. SEARNN \\citep{leblond2018searnn} proposed locally recurrent search-based training to avoid the mismatch entirely. This literature focuses on generation quality degradation in primary objectives. No prior work examines how exposure bias affects auxiliary objectives that target attention distributions, nor how it manifests in multi-turn dialogue settings. Our work identifies a distinct failure mode: auxiliary attention losses that converge under teacher forcing fail completely under autoregressive generation, even when NTP remains robust, because token-level self-recovery does not extend to distributional properties of attention.",

[Director 指令] [Patch — 重大数字更新] D050 决策：Table 1 切换到 eval_200 N=50 数据

**数据变化**（β=0, AR GAR）：

| Condition | Old (N=5, 10-turn) | New (N=50, eval_200) | 95% CI |
|-----------|--------------------|-----------------------|--------|
| Base | 0.012 | 0.019 | [0.014, 0.024] |

| SS | 0.318 (N=5) | 0.347 | [0.327, 0.366] |

**叙事调整要点**：

1. **"zero benefit" → "modest but insufficient benefit"**：TG>LO 显著 (p=0.004, r=0.454)，但 TG 仍有 7.8× gap，exposure bias 仍是主导障碍
2. **"20-33× gap" → "8-17× gap"**：所有出现处更新（Abstract, Intro, Experiments, Discussion, Conclusion）
3. **"0.015-0.025" → "0.019-0.064"**：AR GAR range
4. **SS gap**：从 "31×→1.57×" 更新为适当的新数字（TF 0.50 / AR 0.347 = 1.44×；对比 LO baseline 13.5× → 1.44×）
5. **Table 1**：AR 列更新为新数据 + 添加 95% CI 列 + 添加 Wilcoxon p-value 行
6. **§4.2 结果段**：改写为 "turn-conditioned gating (ThreadGate) provides statistically significant improvement over LoRA-only (p=0.004), yet the residual gap to teacher-forced performance remains massive (7.8×), confirming exposure bias as the dominant barrier"
7. **β=3/5 收敛**仍成立（所有条件收敛到 0.53-0.57 / 0.70-0.73），强调 steering 主导
8. **新增观察**：可在 Discussion 或 Analysis 提一句 "the gating benefit is modulated by conversation length"（短对话有效，长对话消失），增加深度

This is a major update — switching Table 1's AR data from N=5 to N=50 eval_200 data. Let me systematically trace through all the changes needed.

Key changes:
1. Table 1: Update AR column values + add 95% CI column + add Wilcoxon p-value
2. All narrative references to "20-33×" → "8-17×" (or exact numbers)
3. All references to "0.015-0.025" → "0.019-0.064"


4. "zero benefit" → "modest but insufficient benefit"
5. SS gap update: "31×→1.57×" → new numbers
6. §4.2 rewrite
7. Abstract, Intro, Analysis, Discussion, Conclusion updates

Now I'm calculating the revised gap numbers using the new AR values to see how the TF/AR ratios shift across all variants. I'm noticing the SS gap compression is more dramatic than I initially calculated — it goes from around 7.8× (TG baseline) down to 1.44× with SS applied, which is a much stronger effect than the old data suggested. Let me verify which baseline the original SS experiment was actually comparing against, since the old numbers mentioned a 20× improvement that got compressed. The gap compression from 7.8× down to 1.44× is still substantial. The Director's framing compares against the LO baseline of 13.5× to show the full impact, though the cleaner comparison is really the TG baseline improvement.

Looking at the AR improvements: the old numbers showed a 20× jump from 0.016 to 0.318, but with the new data it's a 5.4× increase from 0.064 to 0.347. I should also verify what the Discussion section said about compressing the gap—it mentioned ~31× down to 1.57×, so I need to see how that aligns with these updated numbers.

For the second seed, the old text referenced AR GAR=0.418 with a 1.20× gap, but I haven't found updated numbers for that yet. I'm checking the registry to see if there's a corresponding entry that would let me adjust it proportionally or if I should keep the original value.

Now I'm mapping out which files need updates: the experiments table needs the AR column revised with confidence intervals and p-values, section 4.2 needs a rewrite with the new gap numbers, and the abstract needs the performance range updated from "20-33×" down to "8-17×" along with the adjusted accuracy values.

I'll also need to update the introduction's figure caption and contribution statements, revise sections 5.3 and 5.5 in the analysis with the corrected cross-model comparisons, adjust the discussion's self-supervised paragraph and opening, update the conclusion's gap numbers, and add the supplementary N=5 10-turn data to the appendix.

Before I start editing, let me compile the exact numbers I'll be using throughout: the base AR is 0.019 with a 95% CI of [0.014, 0.024], and I need to gather the corresponding confidence intervals for TG, PCGrad, UG, and LO as well. Now I'm looking at how the steering approach dramatically reduces those gaps—bringing the TF/AR ratio down from 7.8× or 13.5× depending on the baseline, all the way to 1.44×. The steering parameters themselves remain stable across different convergence points. I'm also identifying which methods perform best across the different evaluation metrics: UG leads on the IID GAR-O and held-out GAR-O measures, TG dominates on the GAR-D metrics, and TG also achieves the highest AR GAR-O score.

The Wilcoxon test shows statistical significance between TG and LO at p=0.004. I'm noticing the spread in performance has shifted—the TF variants cluster tightly around 0.50-0.51, while the AR results now span a wider range from 0.030 to 0.064, roughly 3.4 percentage points apart.

Now I'm starting to revise the paper, beginning with Table 1 since it's the most intricate piece. Generating markdown table... I'm realizing the Director specifically wants both an explicit 95% CI column and a Wilcoxon p-value row, so I need to add them properly rather than compress them into existing cells. Since the table is already using the full width format, I have room for one more column, so I'll restructure it to include the CI column alongside the AR metrics and add the p-value as a separate row below the main results.

Writing table structure... Generating markdown table... Formatting the table note...

Now I'm identifying which values should be bolded across the different conditions. The key insight is that turn-conditioned gating is now the best performer in the autoregressive setting at 0.064, which is a shift from the previous results where LoRA-only was stronger. This actually supports the narrative about modest but meaningful improvements.

Moving through the document, I need to update the abstract to reflect the new numbers and emphasize the statistical significance. The gap has narrowed from the original 20-33x down to 8-17x, and the key finding is that turn-conditioned gating shows a statistically significant improvement over LoRA-only fine-tuning with p=0.004.

For the steering and scheduled sampling results, I'm adjusting the compression ratio from 1.57x down to 1.44x based on the updated numbers. The Llama cross-model evaluation appears to be from a separate experiment, so those numbers should remain unchanged unless there's explicit confirmation that they were also updated.

The key issue is that the abstract's ">25×" claim now only applies to Llama since the Qwen gap has narrowed to 8-17×. I need to make that distinction clearer rather than implying both architectures show gaps above 25×. I should also update the contribution statement in the introduction to reflect the new Qwen range.

For the Figure 1 caption, I'm reconsidering whether "order of magnitude" still fits with the 8-17× range. While it's roughly in that ballpark, I should be more precise and directly state the new gap values along with noting that gating provides only modest improvement.

In the body text, I need to update the performance metrics from 0.015--0.025 to 0.019--0.064 and replace "gap exceeding an order of magnitude" with "8--17× gap". The claim about indistinguishable performance needs revision too—under the autoregressive setting, the spread widens to 3.4pp, so that's no longer accurate. And the conclusion about gates needs to shift from "zero measurable benefit" to acknowledging the modest but insufficient improvement from turn-conditioned gating with statistical significance.

For the SS comparison, I'm recalculating the improvement factor now that I have the new AR baseline of 0.064 and SS AR result of 0.347. That gives a 5.4× increase and compresses the original 7.8× gap down to 1.44×. But I need to be careful here—SS is a separate training run, not a continuation of TG, so the baseline for comparison should be clarified. Looking at the director's feedback, I need to reframe the ThreadGate results to emphasize the statistical significance while acknowledging that exposure bias remains the core bottleneck—the 7.8× gap to teacher-forced performance is still the dominant constraint. I'll also verify the other sections hold up with the updated numbers: the TF-AR gap persists across strategies, gate attenuation still can't fully bridge it, and the Llama results stay consistent.

For the cross-model comparison, I need to update the claim about exceeding 25× on both architectures since Qwen now shows 8-17× while Llama is 27×—these are different enough that I should report them separately rather than overgeneralizing. In the discussion section, I'm recalculating the compression ratio with the new GAR-ours values to make sure the narrative about closing the gap is still accurate with the revised numbers.

The second seed result is trickier since I only have updated data for the primary seed at N=50, but the second seed was evaluated at N=5. Without confirmation that it was also re-evaluated, I should either note the different evaluation setting or drop it to avoid confusion about whether the numbers are directly comparable. I need to be systematic about this patch since it's complex. Let me tackle the biggest changes first, then work through each file carefully. The Director also wants me to add a note about how the gating benefit varies with conversation length—I can slip that into the Discussion section. And I'll need to include that N=5 data in the appendix to show the length dependency. Let me start executing this file by file.

Now I'm reviewing the experiments.tex structure to plan the changes to Table 1 and section 4.2. I've already examined this file, so let me focus on the key sections—particularly the current table layout and what needs to be modified there.

Generating markdown table... Generating markdown table...

The key insight here is that all the fine-tuned variants perform nearly identically—they're clustered within 0.75 percentage points of each other, with PPL consistently at 2.78 across the board. This suggests that the specific gating mechanisms don't actually matter; what's driving the improvement is the LoRA fine-tuning itself, which the Base model comparison makes clear by showing the jump from 0.01 to much higher performance.

But there's a striking discrepancy when I look at the autoregressive generation results: the teacher-forced GAR-ours sits at 0.50–0.51, yet during actual generation it plummets to 0.015–0.025, a 20–33× gap that holds across all variants.

I'm checking this with a second seed to confirm it's stable, and the numbers bear out: teacher-forced stays around 0.504±0.001 while autoregressive drops to 0.016±0.001, maintaining roughly a 31× gap. This distribution shift between the two evaluation modes is something I need to dig into more carefully. I need to be careful with the autoregressive results since the N=50 evaluation data only exists for seed=42. For the second seed, I should stick to reporting the teacher-forced stability claim without speculating on AR numbers I don't have. Let me simplify that sentence to just confirm TF consistency across seeds, then focus the paragraph on the seed=42 N=50 results where I have complete data. I'm refining the caption with the specific gap range—8–17× is more precise than "order-of-magnitude"—and noting that ThreadGate significantly outperforms LoRA-only under autoregressive evaluation. I should also add a note about the Wilcoxon test to strengthen the statistical claim.

Now I'm reconsidering the table layout. The confidence intervals are fairly wide, and adding a full column might make the table unwieldy, so I'm exploring whether I can embed the CIs directly within the existing columns instead.

Actually, the Director was explicit about adding a 95% CI column, so I need to include it. Let me check if everything fits—the table is full width at about 6.5 inches with 8 columns currently, and adding one more to make 9 should work if I use `\small` font size.

Time to start making the edits systematically, beginning with the highest-impact changes and using the specific numbers from the Director's reference table. Now I'm calculating the performance gaps between the baseline and each method—TG shows about an 8× improvement, UG around 15×, LO roughly 14×, and PCGrad hits 17×, giving us a range of 8-17×. I need to revise the paper starting with Table 1 in experiments.tex, where I'll bold TG's result since it significantly outperforms LO according to the Director's feedback, then move through the abstract, introduction, analysis, discussion, conclusion, and appendix sections.

For section 4.2, I'm rewriting the paragraph on teacher-forced results to note that all four fine-tuned variants achieve nearly identical performance under this evaluation mode, with GAR-ours varying by less than a percentage point across configurations and consistent perplexity scores.

The second paragraph on Base and GAR-D results emphasizes that LoRA fine-tuning is the key factor driving the performance jump, while the uniform convergence across architecturally distinct variants suggests capacity saturation at rank 16 is unlikely. GAR-Dongre consistently underperforms in standard training but shows promise in preliminary scheduled sampling experiments.

Now looking at the autoregressive generation results: under held-out conversation generation, my approach drops significantly to 0.019–0.064, revealing an 8–17× performance gap compared to teacher-forced settings. Turn-conditioned gating provides statistically meaningful improvement over LoRA alone, yet the gap persists at 7.8×, indicating exposure bias is the primary bottleneck rather than the gating mechanism itself. A second seed confirms the teacher-forced stability holds across runs.

For the analysis section, I'm verifying that the key claims still hold: gates remain ineffective at closing the gap, gradient conflicts aren't the underlying issue, and the teacher-forced to autoregressive performance drop appears consistently across all training approaches. The gate attenuation effect is too small to meaningfully bridge the gap, and the performance degradation exceeds 25× across different model architectures.

Now I need to refine some specific numbers. The cross-model comparison needs updating—Qwen shows an 8–17× gap while Llama reaches 27× by median, both still substantial and supporting the exposure bias hypothesis. For the gate conditioning section, ThreadGate does show some improvement over LoRA-only in autoregressive mode, but the teacher-forced convergence remains unchanged, so I should clarify that the small gate attenuation explains why the effect is limited rather than claiming complete convergence. I need to complete that sentence about the opening paragraph rewrite. The new version should acknowledge that gating shows modest improvement under autoregressive generation, but the gap to teacher-forced performance is still substantial. The diagnostic chain explaining the failure remains valid—gates learning opposite behavior, ruling out gradient conflict, and identifying distribution shift as the root cause—so that analysis section still holds even with the improved TG results.

Now I'm updating the figure captions to reflect the new performance numbers. Figure 3b stays as-is since the distribution shift pattern across variants remains consistent. For Figure 4, I need to change the autoregressive GAR collapse range from 0.015–0.025 to 0.019–0.064 to match the updated results. Figure 1's caption also needs the same adjustment for consistency across the paper.

For the five-way comparison statement, I'm reconsidering the wording—the new data shows gating does provide statistically significant improvement over LoRA-only (p = 0.004), but the absolute gap is still substantial. I'm trying to balance accuracy with caption length, so I'm simplifying to emphasize both the improvement and the remaining challenge.

Now I need to systematically work through the major edits across the paper. I'm prioritizing the files with the most substantial changes: starting with the experiments section and its tables and figures, then moving through the abstract, introduction, analysis, discussion, and conclusion. I'll batch related edits together to reduce compilation cycles and make sure all the revisions are consistent with the new findings.

1	\section{Experiments}
2	\label{sec:experiments}
3	
4	\subsection{Setup}
5	
6	We fine-tune Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct on 8K multi-turn conversations from the UltraChat training split, a dataset of naturalistic dialogues across diverse topics. LoRA adapters (rank 16, $\alpha$=32) are applied to query and value projection layers (\texttt{q\_proj}, \texttt{v\_proj}). The combined loss $\mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}_\text{NTP} + \lambda_\text{GAR}\mathcal{L}_\text{GAR} + \lambda_\text{div}\mathcal{L}_\text{div}$ uses $\lambda_\text{GAR} = \lambda_\text{div} = 1.0$ with MSE target $\tau = 0.5$ (\S\ref{sec:loss}). We train for 3 epochs with AdamW (lr $= 2 \times 10^{-4}$, batch size 1, gradient accumulation 8, seed 42; ThreadGate additionally with seed 123); each variant requires approximately 6 hours on a single NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell Server Edition GPU (102\,GB). Full hyperparameters are provided in Appendix~\ref{sec:appendix-hyper}.
7	
8	We evaluate five configurations that form a controlled comparison isolating four factors. \textbf{ThreadGate}: full system with 28 gate networks (Eq.~\ref{eq:gate}) and three-term loss. \textbf{+PCGrad}: ThreadGate with PCGrad \citep{yu2020pcgrad} projecting conflicting gradients (isolates gradient conflict). \textbf{Uniform Gate}: identical gate architecture with turn embedding replaced by a still-learnable constant vector (content-conditioned but turn-unaware; isolates turn conditioning). \textbf{LoRA-only}: gates fixed at 1.0, trained with $\mathcal{L}_\text{NTP} + \mathcal{L}_\text{GAR}$ only (isolates gating mechanism). \textbf{Base}: pretrained model (isolates fine-tuning). All fine-tuned variants share training data, LoRA configuration, optimizer, and seed. We evaluate under \emph{IID} (same-distribution UltraChat text) and \emph{held-out} (50 non-overlapping conversations) teacher-forced protocols, reporting GAR-ours (last-token attention to goals, \S\ref{sec:background}), GAR-Dongre \citep{dongre2026attention} (all-token average), and PPL.
9	
10	\subsection{Main Results}
11	
12	Table~\ref{tab:four-way} presents the five-way comparison. The central finding is that all four fine-tuned variants converge to nearly identical performance. GAR-ours spans only 0.75 percentage points (pp) across ThreadGate (0.50), +PCGrad (0.50), Uniform Gate (0.51), and LoRA-only (0.50), and PPL is 2.78 for all four on IID evaluation. Neither per-layer gating (ThreadGate), elimination of gradient direction conflict (+PCGrad), nor content-only gating (Uniform Gate) provides any measurable benefit over LoRA-only fine-tuning.
13	
14	The Base model confirms that LoRA fine-tuning is the operative variable: GAR-ours jumps from 0.01 to ${\sim}$0.50, while PPL improves from 4.23 to 2.78. Since all four variants share the same GAR loss ($\tau = 0.5$), convergence near the target is expected and does not demonstrate gating benefit. We cannot exclude LoRA capacity saturation at rank~16, though uniform convergence across four architecturally distinct variants makes this unlikely. GAR-Dongre remains uniformly low (0.01--0.02) across all standard-trained conditions, consistent with \citet{dongre2026attention}; a preliminary scheduled sampling experiment breaks this pattern (\S\ref{sec:discussion}).
15	
16	The teacher-forced GAR-ours of 0.50--0.51 stands in sharp contrast to autoregressive generation, where GAR-ours drops to 0.015--0.025 across all fine-tuned variants, a 20--33$\times$ gap. This gap is universal: it persists across all training strategies---gating, gradient conflict elimination, and LoRA-only fine-tuning alike. A second ThreadGate seed (123) confirms stability: TF GAR-ours $0.504\pm0.001$, AR GAR-ours $0.016\pm0.001$, gap ${\sim}$31$\times$ (range 30.5--32.1$\times$), with identical PPL. We analyze this distribution shift in \S\ref{sec:analysis}.

46	\subsection{Inference-Time Attention Steering}\label{subsec:steering}
47	
48	All training-time interventions fail uniformly. We test whether inference-time attention manipulation can recover GAR by applying an additive bias $\beta$ to goal-token attention logits at every layer of the ThreadGate checkpoint during generation.
49	
50	An initial sweep on $N$\,=\,5 ten-turn conversations (Figure~\ref{fig:steering}a) reveals a sharp nonlinearity between $\beta$\,=\,2 and $\beta$\,=\,5: GAR increases ${\sim}$11$\times$ (0.062\,$\to$\,0.6795$\pm$0.020) while PPL rises 35\% (1.41\,$\to$\,1.91). At $\beta$\,=\,10, GAR saturates at 0.959 but PPL degrades to 4.22.
51	
52	$N$\,=\,50 conversations from a held-out evaluation set (39 with $\geq$3 turns, mean 3.6 user turns; Figure~\ref{fig:steering}b) confirm the qualitative steering pattern observed in the $N$\,=\,5 pilot (10 turns each), with consistent nonlinearity range and saturation behavior. A finer $\beta$ sweep localizes the nonlinearity: GAR jumps from 0.128$\pm$0.110 ($\beta$\,=\,2) to 0.556$\pm$0.060 ($\beta$\,=\,3), an 8.7$\times$ recovery from baseline with only 9\% PPL increase (1.43\,$\to$\,1.56), identifying $\beta$\,=\,3 as a practical operating point. The $\beta$\,=\,0 distribution is right-skewed (mean 0.064, median 0.031, std 0.081), driven by short conversations with high baseline GAR; absolute baselines therefore differ from the 10-turn $N$\,=\,5 evaluation (0.028). At $\beta$\,=\,5, GAR reaches 0.727$\pm$0.061 with PPL 1.77$\pm$0.27, confirming the recovery pattern at scale.
53	
54	These results provide constructive evidence that attention misallocation---not representation degradation---is a proximal cause of exposure-bias-induced GAR failure under the tested conditions (Qwen-2.5-7B, UltraChat, GAR-family losses): manually correcting attention via $\beta$ bias restores GAR, and inference-time intervention circumvents the exposure bias barrier. This steering experiment is diagnostic: it requires identifying goal tokens, trivial for system prompts but not generalizable.

LoRA adapters (rank 16, $\\alpha$=32) are applied to query and value projection layers (\\texttt{q\\_proj}, \\texttt{v\\_proj}). The combined loss $\\mathcal{L} = \\mathcal{L}_\\text{NTP} + \\lambda_\\text{GAR}\\mathcal{L}_\\text{GAR} + \\lambda_\\text{div}\\mathcal{L}_\\text{div}$ uses $\\lambda_\\text{GAR} = \\lambda_\\text{div} = 1.0$ with MSE target $\\tau = 0.5$ (\\S\\ref{sec:loss}). We train for 3 epochs with AdamW (lr $= 2 \\times 10^{-4}$, batch size 1, gradient accumulation 8, seed 42; ThreadGate additionally with seed 123); each variant requires approximately 6 hours on a single NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell Server Edition GPU (102\\,GB). Full hyperparameters are provided in Appendix~\\ref{sec:appendix-hyper}.\n\nWe evaluate five configurations that form a controlled comparison isolating four factors. \\textbf{ThreadGate}: full system with 28 gate networks (Eq.~\\ref{eq:gate}) and three-term loss. \\textbf{+PCGrad}: ThreadGate with PCGrad \\citep{yu2020pcgrad} projecting conflicting gradients (isolates gradient conflict). \\textbf{Uniform Gate}: identical gate architecture with turn embedding replaced by a still-learnable constant vector (content-conditioned but turn-unaware; isolates turn conditioning). \\textbf{LoRA-only}: gates fixed at 1.0, trained with $\\mathcal{L}_\\text{NTP} + \\mathcal{L}_\\text{GAR}$ only (isolates gating mechanism). \\textbf{Base}: pretrained model (isolates fine-tuning). All fine-tuned variants share training data, LoRA configuration, optimizer, and seed. We evaluate under \\emph{IID} (same-distribution UltraChat text) and \\emph{held-out} (50 non-overlapping conversations) teacher-forced protocols, reporting GAR-ours (last-token attention to goals, \\S\\ref{sec:background}), GAR-Dongre \\citep{dongre2026attention} (all-token average), and PPL.\n\n\\subsection{Main Results}\n\nTable~\\ref{tab:four-way} presents the five-way comparison. The central finding is that all four fine-tuned variants converge to nearly identical performance. GAR-ours spans only 0.75 percentage points (pp) across ThreadGate (0.50), +PCGrad (0.50), Uniform Gate (0.51), and LoRA-only (0.50), and PPL is 2.78 for all four on IID evaluation. Neither per-layer gating (ThreadGate), elimination of gradient direction conflict (+PCGrad), nor content-only gating (Uniform Gate) provides any measurable benefit over LoRA-only fine-tuning.\n\nThe Base model confirms that LoRA fine-tuning is the operative variable: GAR-ours jumps from 0.01 to ${\\sim}$0.50, while PPL improves from 4.23 to 2.78. Since all four variants share the same GAR loss ($\\tau = 0.5$), convergence near the target is expected and does not demonstrate gating benefit. We cannot exclude LoRA capacity saturation at rank~16, though uniform convergence across four architecturally distinct variants makes this unlikely. GAR-Dongre remains uniformly low (0.01--0.02) across all standard-trained conditions, consistent with \\citet{dongre2026attention}; a preliminary scheduled sampling experiment breaks this pattern (\\S\\ref{sec:discussion}).\n\nThe teacher-forced GAR-ours of 0.50--0.51 stands in sharp contrast to autoregressive generation, where GAR-ours drops to 0.015--0.025 across all fine-tuned variants, a 20--33$\\times$ gap. This gap is universal: it persists across all training strategies---gating, gradient conflict elimination, and LoRA-only fine-tuning alike. A second ThreadGate seed (123) confirms stability: TF GAR-ours $0.504\\pm0.001$, AR GAR-ours $0.016\\pm0.001$, gap ${\\sim}$31$\\times$ (range 30.5--32.1$\\times$), with identical PPL. We analyze this distribution shift in \\S\\ref{sec:analysis}.\n\n\\begin{table*}[t]\n\\centering\n\\small\n\\caption{Five-way comparison on Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct.

OK, now I have a complete picture. Also, I notice that in §4.3 (Steering), line 48 says "All training-time interventions fail uniformly." This needs to be softened since TG now shows significant improvement. Let me change to "All training-time interventions leave the exposure bias gap largely intact."

Also, line 52 mentions "The $\beta$\,=\,0 distribution is right-skewed (mean 0.064, median 0.031, std 0.081)" — this 0.064 is the steering experiment's β=0 value for TG on N=50. 

Good, that matches the new Table 1 AR GAR-O for TG, so the steering experiment was already using the N=50 eval and everything's consistent. Now I'll execute all the edits in batches, starting with the biggest changes to experiments.tex: Table 1, §4.2, Fig 4 caption, and §4.3 opening.

    "originalFile": "\\section{Experiments}\n\\label{sec:experiments}\n\n\\subsection{Setup}\n\nWe fine-tune Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct on 8K multi-turn conversations from the UltraChat training split, a dataset of naturalistic dialogues across diverse topics. LoRA adapters (rank 16, $\\alpha$=32) are applied to query and value projection layers (\\texttt{q\\_proj}, \\texttt{v\\_proj}). The combined loss $\\mathcal{L} = \\mathcal{L}_\\text{NTP} + \\lambda_\\text{GAR}\\mathcal{L}_\\text{GAR} + \\lambda_\\text{div}\\mathcal{L}_\\text{div}$ uses $\\lambda_\\text{GAR} = \\lambda_\\text{div} = 1.0$ with MSE target $\\tau = 0.5$ (\\S\\ref{sec:loss}). We train for 3 epochs with AdamW (lr $= 2 \\times 10^{-4}$, batch size 1, gradient accumulation 8, seed 42; ThreadGate additionally with seed 123); each variant requires approximately 6 hours on a single NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell Server Edition GPU (102\\,GB). Full hyperparameters are provided in Appendix~\\ref{sec:appendix-hyper}.\n\nWe evaluate five configurations that form a controlled comparison isolating four factors. \\textbf{ThreadGate}: full system with 28 gate networks (Eq.~\\ref{eq:gate}) and three-term loss. \\textbf{+PCGrad}: ThreadGate with PCGrad \\citep{yu2020pcgrad} projecting conflicting gradients (isolates gradient conflict). \\textbf{Uniform Gate}: identical gate architecture with turn embedding replaced by a still-learnable constant vector (content-conditioned but turn-unaware; isolates turn conditioning). \\textbf{LoRA-only}: gates fixed at 1.0, trained with $\\mathcal{L}_\\text{NTP} + \\mathcal{L}_\\text{GAR}$ only (isolates gating mechanism). \\textbf{Base}: pretrained model (isolates fine-tuning). All fine-tuned variants share training data, LoRA configuration, optimizer, and seed. We evaluate under \\emph{IID} (same-distribution UltraChat text) and \\emph{held-out} (50 non-overlapping conversations) teacher-forced protocols, reporting GAR-ours (last-token attention to goals, \\S\\ref{sec:background}), GAR-Dongre \\citep{dongre2026attention} (all-token average), and PPL.\n\n\\subsection{Main Results}\n\nTable~\\ref{tab:four-way} presents the five-way comparison. The central finding is that all four fine-tuned variants converge to nearly identical performance. GAR-ours spans only 0.75 percentage points (pp) across ThreadGate (0.50), +PCGrad (0.50), Uniform Gate (0.51), and LoRA-only (0.50), and PPL is 2.78 for all four on IID evaluation. Neither per-layer gating (ThreadGate), elimination of gradient direction conflict (+PCGrad), nor content-only gating (Uniform Gate) provides any measurable benefit over LoRA-only fine-tuning.\n\nThe Base model confirms that LoRA fine-tuning is the operative variable: GAR-ours jumps from 0.01 to ${\\sim}$0.50, while PPL improves from 4.23 to 2.78. Since all four variants share the same GAR loss ($\\tau = 0.5$), convergence near the target is expected and does not demonstrate gating benefit. We cannot exclude LoRA capacity saturation at rank~16, though uniform convergence across four architecturally distinct variants makes this unlikely. GAR-Dongre remains uniformly low (0.01--0.02) across all standard-trained conditions, consistent with \\citet{dongre2026attention}; a preliminary scheduled sampling experiment breaks this pattern (\\S\\ref{sec:discussion}).\n\nThe teacher-forced GAR-ours of 0.50--0.51 stands in sharp contrast to autoregressive generation, where GAR-ours drops to 0.015--0.025 across all fine-tuned variants, a 20--33$\\times$ gap. This gap is universal: it persists across all training strategies---gating, gradient conflict elimination, and LoRA-only fine-tuning alike. A second ThreadGate seed (123) confirms stability: TF GAR-ours $0.504\\pm0.001$, AR GAR-ours $0.016\\pm0.001$, gap ${\\sim}$31$\\times$ (range 30.5--32.1$\\times$), with identical PPL. We analyze this distribution shift in \\S\\ref{sec:analysis}.\n\n\\begin{table*}[t]\n\\centering\n\\small\n\\caption{Five-way comparison on Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct.

Despite this preservation, autoregressive GAR collapses to 0.015--0.025 for all variants (Table~\\ref{tab:four-way}), consistent with distribution shift as the primary failure mode under these conditions.}\n  \\label{fig:attention-heatmap}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\subsection{Inference-Time Attention Steering}\\label{subsec:steering}\n\nAll training-time interventions fail uniformly. We test whether inference-time attention manipulation can recover GAR by applying an additive bias $\\beta$ to goal-token attention logits at every layer of the ThreadGate checkpoint during generation.\n\nAn initial sweep on $N$\\,=\\,5 ten-turn conversations (Figure~\\ref{fig:steering}a) reveals a sharp nonlinearity between $\\beta$\\,=\\,2 and $\\beta$\\,=\\,5: GAR increases ${\\sim}$11$\\times$ (0.062\\,$\\to$\\,0.6795$\\pm$0.020) while PPL rises 35\\% (1.41\\,$\\to$\\,1.91). At $\\beta$\\,=\\,10, GAR saturates at 0.959 but PPL degrades to 4.22.\n\n$N$\\,=\\,50 conversations from a held-out evaluation set (39 with $\\geq$3 turns, mean 3.6 user turns; Figure~\\ref{fig:steering}b) confirm the qualitative steering pattern observed in the $N$\\,=\\,5 pilot (10 turns each), with consistent nonlinearity range and saturation behavior. A finer $\\beta$ sweep localizes the nonlinearity: GAR jumps from 0.128$\\pm$0.110 ($\\beta$\\,=\\,2) to 0.556$\\pm$0.060 ($\\beta$\\,=\\,3), an 8.7$\\times$ recovery from baseline with only 9\\% PPL increase (1.43\\,$\\to$\\,1.56), identifying $\\beta$\\,=\\,3 as a practical operating point. The $\\beta$\\,=\\,0 distribution is right-skewed (mean 0.064, median 0.031, std 0.081), driven by short conversations with high baseline GAR; absolute baselines therefore differ from the 10-turn $N$\\,=\\,5 evaluation (0.028). At $\\beta$\\,=\\,5, GAR reaches 0.727$\\pm$0.061 with PPL 1.77$\\pm$0.27, confirming the recovery pattern at scale.\n\nThese results provide constructive evidence that attention misallocation---not representation degradation---is a proximal cause of exposure-bias-induced GAR failure under the tested conditions (Qwen-2.5-7B, UltraChat, GAR-family losses): manually correcting attention via $\\beta$ bias restores GAR, and inference-time intervention circumvents the exposure bias barrier. This steering experiment is diagnostic: it requires identifying goal tokens, trivial for system prompts but not generalizable.\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n  \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{fig5_attention_steering.pdf}\n  \\caption{Inference-time attention steering: additive bias $\\beta$ applied to goal-token attention logits during autoregressive generation (error bars show $\\pm$1\\,std).
