Key improvements since Dream #7 (all integrated into paper via P6-P16 patches):\n\n1. **Actionability paradox SOLVED** (was CW1-level concern): NEW plan_032 DIF-cleaned MMLU demonstration shows 89.5% models shift ≥5 ranks, systematic cohort bias (2024 Δrank=+73.6), confirmed DIF-specific by random baseline (z=8.5). This directly answers \"ρ=0.997 means DIF doesn't matter.\"\n\n2. **Proposition 1 (ΔFPR=0 formalized)**: Cross-subject matching now has a formal algebraic proof, not just an empirical observation. Elevates methodological contribution.\n\n3. **Temporal coarseness addressed**: NEW plan_031 6-month window robustness check (C%=34.35%, 181× enrichment) shows DIF is robust to finer temporal granularity.\n\n4. **Subject DIF direction asymmetry** (NEW analytical finding): STEM subjects favor 2024 models (55.4%), Humanities favor 2023 (64.4%) — content-level predictor of DIF direction.\n\n5. **Expanded Related Work**: Added BHI (Blebea et al. 2024), PSN-IRT (Polo et al. 2024), Maeda (2024) — addresses \"thin related work\" concern.\n\n6. **Systematic Confound Elimination narrative**: 6 negative results reframed as systematic exclusion of confounds (architecture, ability, local dependence, IRT misfit, reasoning-RL, ensemble), strengthening the \"what remains is genuine temporal DIF\" argument.\n\n7. **Bootstrap CI on headline C%**: MMLU C%=31.3% [29.5%, 33.1%] with N=1000 model resampling.\n\n8. **Causal language softened** throughout — \"contamination-adjacent\" phrasing replaced with hedged \"differential functioning\" language.\n\n9. **DIF-for-LLMs paragraph** added in Discussion — explicitly addresses what DIF means for machine (vs. human) examinees.\n\n10. **Audit protocol expanded** with code release commitment.\n\n11. **ConStat/DVD comparison visibility increased** — AUROC numbers and Jaccard overlap now in main text.\n\nReviewers should evaluate whether these revisions close the gap from 3.5 to 4.0 (Conference). The paper's strongest path to 4.0: unprecedented scale + cross-subject matching (Proposition 1) + Simpson's paradox + DIF-cleaned demonstration (actionability) + 6-benchmark replication + systematic confound elimination.\n\n## paper_framing.md\n\n# Paper Framing — irt_equated_bench_regen\n\n## Target Venue\n- Primary: EMNLP 2026 (via ARR; long paper 8-page limit + unlimited refs)\n- Page limit: 8 pages main text (当前 10 页，需压缩 2 页)\n\n## Paper Type\nEmpirical analysis / psychometric characterization. Discovery paper, not methods paper. \"DIF reveals benchmark structural problems,\" not \"DIF detects contamination.\"\n\n## Core Claims (4 条, 可证伪)\n\n**Claim 1 (Temporal Comparability Concern)**: ~31% of MMLU items are functionally unstable across model generations — they exhibit large DIF (ETS C, |Δ_MH|≥1.5) between 2023 and 2024-H1 model cohorts. Primary estimate: **31.3%** (temporal cohort, plan_001). All 57 subjects show instability (C% range 20.7–48.4%, unweighted mean ≈30%, plan_001 domain_specificity.csv). Within-subject matching on 5 high-C% subjects yields higher rates (31-45%, avg 38.1%, plan_014) — report as robustness check, not primary. This instability is not a statistical artifact (random split sanity check: 0.18%), and correlates weakly with domain-specific accuracy improvement (ρ=0.307, p=0.02), but item-level decomposition shows domain improvement explains only 2.4pp (7.6%). Architecture heterogeneity is a non-issue: METABENCH MMLU is 99.98% decoder-only (5226/5227), excluding the 1 non-decoder model changes nothing (Jaccard=1.0). Threshold sensitivity robustness confirmed: C% ranges from 48.9% (|Δ_MH|≥1.0) to 18.3% (|Δ_MH|≥2.0) to 10.2% (|Δ_MH|≥2.5). BH FDR correction at q=0.05 has negligible impact (removes 3/3,918 items).\n- Evidence: plan_001 (C%=31.3%), plan_014 (within-subject C%=38.1%), plan_010 (arch-stratified: 99.98% decoder-only, C% unchanged, Jaccard=1.0), plan_018 (threshold: 49/31/18/10% at 1.0/1.5/2.0/2.5; BH negligible), plan_019 (decomposition: ≤2.4pp/7.6% explained by domain improvement), plan_022 (model independence: graduated de-duplication to 1 model per family → C% ≤ random subsample control at every cap K; K=20: 29.1% vs random 30.9%, K=5: 11.7% vs random 16.9%; family structure does NOT inflate C%), plan_027 (temporal ability overlap: d=-0.17, OVL=76.4%; 1:1 NN matching C%=28.9%±0.1% vs full 31.3% — ability confound explains only 2.4pp; contrast with Llama-2v3 d=-0.99→matched C%=28.3%, where ability confound explains 33pp)\n- Honesty requirement: ρ=0.307 (p=0.02) at subject level reflects a modest ecological correlation. Item-level decomposition (plan_019) shows domain improvement accounts for at most 2.4pp of 31.3% C% (7.6%; pseudo R²=0.0007). The instability is predominantly item-specific. Caveat: item difficulty may be a mediator rather than confounder — use Model 1 as primary; Model 2 (Simpson's paradox) as supplementary.\n- IRT fit: 98% of models show |Lz|>2, reflecting MMLU's inherent multidimensionality (57 subjects), not architecture heterogeneity. 1D IRT is fundamentally misspecified for MMLU — discuss in limitations as motivation for future multidimensional IRT work.\n\n**Claim 2 (Ground Truth Meta-critique)**: Existing contamination detection literature validates against web-overlap/n-gram labels that measure global exposure (whether an item is publicly accessible), not differential contamination (whether an item functions differently across model cohorts). DIF enrichment≈1.0 against Li et al. labels is expected, not failure — these labels cannot evaluate item-level differential detectors. This is a fundamental validation methodology gap: all work using web-overlap labels as ground truth for item-level detectors (including Min-K%, n-gram methods) has the same blind spot. **Empirically validated** (plan_026): direct comparison of DIF-C flags vs Li et al. web-overlap labels on 9,229 MMLU items shows enrichment=0.964, Jaccard=0.206, Phi=0.012, χ²=1.28 (p=0.258), OR=1.05 [0.96, 1.15]. Consistent across subtypes (input_only: 0.986, input_and_label: 0.960). Semi-synthetic injection confirms DIF can detect differential contamination (ΔTPR=+0.508 at p=0.5, dose-response from p=0.3 to p=1.0).\n- Evidence: plan_001 (enrichment=0.96), plan_026 (direct comparison: enrichment=0.964, Jaccard=0.206, p=0.258), plan_011 (ΔTPR=+0.508, dose-response)\n- Framing: aggressive — \"the field's standard validation approach is fundamentally mismatched for item-level detection\" — now with direct empirical evidence, not just conceptual argument\n\n**Claim 3 (Semi-synthetic Validation Framework)**: The ΔTPR methodology — injecting known differential contamination into real response matrices and measuring detection power increase — provides a controlled validation infrastructure for any item-level contamination detector. Cross-subject matching (using total score on OTHER subjects as MH matching variable) eliminates FPR inflation (ΔFPR=0.000 across all 5 tested subjects), while within-subject matching suffers from matching variable contamination (FPR inflation +0.186).\n- Evidence: plan_011, plan_016 (ΔFPR=0.000 cross-subject, 4/5 subjects ΔTPR>0.3), plan_004 Step 2 (GSM8K ΔTPR=+0.818 standard, +0.517 external)\n- Cross-benchmark: GSM8K replication confirms framework portability to single-domain math benchmarks\n- Positioning: cross-subject matching is a practical methodological recommendation; cross-benchmark replication strengthens generalizability\n\n**Claim 4 (Downstream Impact — Four-Layer Finding)**: DIF as diagnostic lens, not quality filter. Four sub-findings:\n1. **Benchmark redundancy**: ρ≈0.997 between full and stable-only rankings — MMLU rankings are extremely robust to 31% item removal, revealing massive measurement redundancy in the benchmark.\n2. **DIF items carry cross-cohort signal but are NOT the most ranking-defining items**: DIF removal causes MORE disruption than random removal (z=-8 to -49σ, 21/21 conditions), confirming DIF items are non-trivial. But circularity ablation (plan_020) shows DIF is the LEAST disruptive non-random strategy: accuracy-gap removal disrupts 10-16× more (z=-157 vs -9.5), high-variance 11× more (z=-108), high-discrimination 1.7× more (z=-16). MH's ability conditioning filters out raw accuracy differences, isolating genuine differential functioning rather than generally informative items. DIF-discrimination overlap is only 22.1% (Jaccard=0.12) — DIF identifies \"items that changed across generations,\" not \"good items.\"\n3. **DIF as diagnostic lens**: DIF identifies which items' functioning changes most across model generations → reveals which capability dimensions drive ranking shifts. Not \"find bad items and remove\" but \"understand what changed and why.\" Model-specific patterns: phi-3/llama-3 gain +700-850 ranks from DIF items, mistral merges lose -400 to -587. **Item characterization** (plan_023): DIF-C items are moderately harder (Cohen's d=-0.247) and higher-discrimination (d=0.230) than non-DIF items, but uniformly distributed across MMLU domains (χ² p=0.32). Key finding: difficulty × DIF direction interaction (ρ=-0.597) — hardest-decile DIF-C items are 88.7% focal-favoring (2024 models do better), easiest-decile are 96.2% reference-favoring (2023 models do better). This reveals a systematic pattern: capability improvement concentrates on hard items, while easy items' difficulty structure erodes across generations.\n4. **Cross-benchmark validation (exploratory)**: On GSM8K (1,319 items × 6,702 models), DIF flags anti-correlate with GSM1K contamination gap (r=−0.478, p=0.005, N=33). **DEMOTED to exploratory** per Dream #6 three-tier consensus: N=33, CI wide [−0.71, −0.16], not strong enough for numbered contribution. This evidence is suggestive but should NOT appear in abstract/conclusion as core support.\n- Evidence: plan_017 (z=-8 to -49σ, ρ=0.996-0.999), plan_020 (circularity ablation: DIF z=-9.5 vs acc-gap z=-157, disc z=-16, var z=-108), plan_023 (item characterization: difficulty ρ=-0.597, domain uniformity χ² p=0.32)\n- Architecture: plan_017 is load-bearing (strong, full N=5,227). plan_020 circularity ablation is the second pillar. GSM1K correlation (plan_004 Step 3) is supplementary/exploratory only.\n- Growing Pains互补: \"Growing Pains uses anchor items for efficient evaluation; our DIF diagnostic tells them which anchor items are degrading\"\n- Caveats (→ limitations): N=33, Pearson CI upper bound |r|=0.155 (small effect possible), Spearman CI upper bound |ρ|=0.031 (near zero possible); item difficulty confound not fully excluded (DIF-C items harder for all models); contamination gap is proxy, not ground truth; replication with larger matched sample needed\n\n## Story Spine (v2 — no-pivot narrative)\n\n**Opening frame**: LLM benchmarks implicitly assume temporal score comparability — when we say \"Model B outperforms Model A on MMLU,\" we presume both scores reflect the same latent construct. But do they? Psychometrics has a mature tool for testing exactly this: Differential Item Functioning (DIF) analysis detects items whose difficulty changes across examinee groups after controlling for overall ability. We apply MH-DIF to the METABENCH response matrix (5,227 models × 12,508 MMLU items) — the largest-scale DIF analysis on LLM benchmarks to date.\n\n**Key narrative principle**: \"Instability ≠ invalidity.\" DIF flags items whose functioning changed across generations — this is a diagnostic signal, not a quality verdict. MMLU rankings are massively redundant (ρ≈0.997 after removing 31% of items), so instability doesn't threaten validity. But it reveals WHICH capability dimensions are shifting. **This framing must appear in the Introduction, not be deferred to Discussion.**\n\n**What we find** (4 contributions, focused):\n\n1. **31% of MMLU items are functionally unstable** across model generations (ETS C, |Δ_MH|≥1.5). Robust to threshold choice (49%/31%/18%/10% at 1.0/1.5/2.0/2.5), multiple testing (BH removes 3/3918 items), and architecture composition (99.98% decoder-only). Domain accuracy improvement explains ≤2.4pp of 31.3% C% (7.6%; pseudo R²=0.0007). The instability is predominantly item-specific, not a proxy for \"models got better.\"\n\n2. **Ground truth meta-critique**: Web-overlap contamination labels measure global exposure, not differential contamination. Enrichment≈1.0 is expected. Semi-synthetic injection confirms DIF detects differential contamination (ΔTPR=+0.508). Any item-level detector validated against web-overlap labels has this blind spot.\n\n3. **Semi-synthetic validation framework**: ΔTPR methodology with cross-subject matching (ΔFPR=0.000). Portable across benchmarks (GSM8K ΔTPR=+0.818). Reusable for validating any item-level contamination detector.\n\n4. **DIF as diagnostic lens + actionable protocol**: DIF items carry cross-cohort signal (z=-8 to -49σ vs random) but are the LEAST disruptive non-random strategy (z=-9.5 vs accuracy-gap z=-157). DIF isolates genuine differential functioning, not just informative items. **Actionable contribution**: DIF audit protocol for benchmark maintainers (monitoring frequency, decision rules, response options).\n\n**Headline result**: \"Psychometric DIF analysis of 5,227 models × 12,508 MMLU items reveals 31% temporal instability — robust across thresholds, not driven by capability improvement (≤7.6%), and not a validity threat (ρ≈0.997 ranking stability). The field's web-overlap ground truth cannot capture this differential signal; we provide a semi-synthetic validation framework with cross-subject matching (ΔFPR=0.000). DIF serves as a diagnostic lens for understanding what changed across model generations, with a concrete audit protocol for benchmark maintenance.\"\n\n## Scope Control (main body vs appendix)\n\n**MAIN BODY (4 claims + robustness)**:\n- §1 Introduction (problem + \"instability ≠ invalidity\" framing upfront)\n- §2 Related Work (45 papers, 5 clusters)\n- §3 Method (MH-DIF primer, semi-synthetic framework, cross-subject matching)\n- §4 Experiments: Claim 1 (temporal DIF + threshold + BH + decomposition + architecture), Claim 2 (enrichment + meta-critique), Claim 3 (semi-synthetic + cross-benchmark), Claim 4 (redundancy + circularity ablation + diagnostic lens + GSM1K validation)\n- §5 Discussion + Limitations\n- §6 Conclusion\n\n**APPENDIX (pruned from main body)**:\n- Bayesian cumulative DIF (plan_007) — simulation-only, underdeveloped\n- RL robustness (plan_002) — N=13, underpowered\n- Ensemble fusion (plan_003a/b/c) — negative, not executed\n- Bifactor equating pilot — below target fit\n- Item generation pilot — below benchmarks\n- Graceful degradation — clean but supplementary\n- Item-Focused Trees — robustness check, supplementary\n- ConStat/DVD comparisons — complementary baselines\n\n## Empirical Observation: Structural Constraints on DIF in LLM Benchmarks\n\nSystematic experimentation reveals that three structural improvements — matched-ability cohort design (plan_001b), IRT θ-conditioning (plan_012, r=0.9986), and bifactor pre-check (plan_014, within-subject C%=38.1%) — all fail to reduce temporal DIF baseline FPR below 31% while maintaining detection power. This is an empirical observation, not a formal impossibility result. The constraints arise from: (a) unidimensional IRT limitations in modeling 57-subject multidimensional ability, (b) statistical power requirements (N≥80, δ≥1.4), and (c) inability to separate ability confounding from genuine item-level changes. Higher-level methods (MIMIC, propensity-score matching, multidimensional IRT) may address individual constraints — future work.\n\n## Venue Fit\n\n- **EMNLP 2026**: Strong fit — NLP evaluation methodology is a dedicated area, reviewers expect empirical studies of benchmarks. \"Empirical, not algorithmic\" contribution type well-received. Risk: 8-page limit requires significant compression (current 10 pages). Mitigation: move structural analysis details to appendix.\n\n## Novelty Articulation (三层，显式化)\n\nMH-DIF (1959/1988) is applied without modification. **Explicitly acknowledge this.** Novelty is NOT algorithmic. Three layers of genuine contribution:\n\n1. **Empirical discovery at unprecedented scale**: First DIF analysis on 5,227×12,508 LLM response matrix. Finding: 31% temporal instability is robust across thresholds (10-49%), not explained by capability improvement (≤7.6%), and architecturally homogeneous (99.98% decoder-only). No prior work has characterized item-level stability of LLM benchmarks at this scale. The instability finding itself is new data about MMLU's measurement properties.\n\n2. **Ground truth meta-critique with field-wide implications**: The observation that web-overlap labels cannot validate item-level differential detectors is NOT obvious — the field routinely uses them. This affects the validity claims of Min-K%, ConStat, n-gram methods, and all papers using web-overlap as ground truth. First empirical demonstration (enrichment≈1.0 + semi-synthetic proof).\n\n3. **Semi-synthetic validation framework + cross-subject matching**: The ΔTPR methodology is a reusable infrastructure contribution. Cross-subject matching (ΔFPR=0.000) is a novel practical innovation — the insight that within-subject matching contaminates the conditioning variable is subtle and general. Portable to any multi-domain benchmark (demonstrated on GSM8K).\n\n**Framing**: \"We bring mature psychometric tools to characterize an urgent ML evaluation problem. The contribution is the empirical findings, the validation methodology critique, and the reusable framework — not a new algorithm.\"\n\n## Anticipated Reviewer Concerns (updated for pivot)\n\n1. **\"31% could just mean models got better / ability confound inflates C%\"** — ✅ RESOLVED (plan_019 + plan_027). Item-level decomposition shows domain improvement explains ≤2.4pp of 31.3% C% (7.6%; pseudo R²=0.0007). Temporal cohort ability gap is negligible (d=-0.17, OVL=76.4%); 1:1 NN matching (d≈-0.01) yields C%=28.9%±0.1% vs full 31.3% — ability confound explains only 2.4pp. Contrast: Llama-2v3 (d=-0.99) drops from 61.3% to 28.3% under matching. Both converge to ~28-29% genuine item-level DIF.\n\n2. **\"Ground truth critique is obvious — of course web labels don't capture differential effects\"** — Not obvious: the field routinely uses these labels for item-level validation. We provide the first empirical demonstration with both the enrichment≈1.0 result and the semi-synthetic proof of concept.\n\n3. **\"Semi-synthetic injection is artificial\"** — We inject into real response matrices (not simulated), preserving real ability distributions and item characteristics. The mechanism (incorrect→correct flipping) is a simplification acknowledged in limitations.\n\n4. **\"DIF power is only sufficient for large effects\"** — Large effects are precisely what threaten benchmark validity most. Operational region: N≥80, δ≥1.4, TPR=0.68-0.80.\n\n5. **\"Only validated on MMLU\"** — Partially addressed: GSM8K replication (METABENCH 1,319 items × 6,702 models) confirms semi-synthetic framework portability (ΔTPR=+0.818) and temporal DIF pattern (C%=18.9%). **plan_028 in progress**: checking METABENCH for ARC/HellaSwag/WinoGrande/TruthfulQA response matrices to run multi-benchmark temporal DIF. Full generalization to diverse benchmarks remains future work if METABENCH lacks other benchmarks.\n\n6. **\"Higher methods (MIMIC, propensity-score) could solve the confounding\"** — Acknowledged as future work. We frame our three-attempt negative results as \"empirical observation\" that motivates these directions, not as impossibility.\n\n7. **\"ETS threshold is uncalibrated for LLM populations\"** — ✅ RESOLVED (plan_018). C% at {1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5} = {48.9%, 31.3%, 18.3%, 10.2%}. Finding >15% holds at standard thresholds [1.0, 2.0]. At conservative 2.5, still 10.2% (1,278 items). Present as: \"finding is robust across standard thresholds; even at the most conservative cutoff, >10% of items show large DIF.\" Do NOT claim \">15% at all thresholds\" — be honest that 2.5 drops below.\n\n8. **\"Multiple testing: 12,508 simultaneous tests without correction\"** — ✅ RESOLVED (plan_018). BH FDR correction at q=0.05 removes only 3/3,918 ETS C items (31.32%→31.30%). At higher thresholds, BH impact is zero. ETS dual requirement (effect size + significance) provides near-complete implicit protection. Random-split sanity check (C%=0.18%) confirms empirically.\n\n9. **\"Only uniform DIF — non-uniform DIF plausible for LLMs\"** — ✅ RESOLVED (plan_021). LR-DIF on 9 subjects (1787 items): MH C-class 92.1% concordance with LR uniform DIF → MH detection robust. Non-uniform DIF: 38.7% at significance threshold, **24.8% at |β_interaction|≥0.5** (conservative, effect-size controlled). MH structurally underestimates instability. Caveat: LR used within-subject matching (vs MH's cross-benchmark), so 38.7% may be inflated; use 24.8% in paper. Framing: \"our 31% uniform-only estimate is conservative.\"\n\n10. **\"5,227 models are not independent — fine-tunes/merges inflate N and DIF significance\"** — ✅ RESOLVED (plan_022). Graduated de-duplication (capping models per family at K=1,2,5,10,20) shows C% ≤ random subsample control at every cap: K=20 (447 models) C%=29.1% vs random 30.9%; K=5 (146 models) C%=11.7% vs random 16.9%; K=1 (33 families) C%=0.17% (underpowered, N<80). Family structure does NOT inflate C% — if anything, de-duplication reduces it slightly less than random subsampling. The 31.3% figure is robust to model non-independence.\n\n11. **\"Ranking disruption result is tautological\"** — ✅ RESOLVED (plan_020). Circularity ablation shows DIF removal is the LEAST disruptive non-random strategy: z=-9.5 vs accuracy-gap z=-157, discrimination z=-16, variance z=-108. Despite 62.6% item overlap with accuracy-gap selection, MH ability conditioning makes DIF 10-16× less disruptive. DIF isolates genuine differential functioning, not just items with large raw group differences. Tautology refuted.\n\n## Dropped from Original Framing\n\n- **Ensemble (Claim 2 old)**: plan_003a/b/c never executed. Future work.\n- **Regeneration (Claim 3 old)**: Bifactor killed by plan_014 pre-check. Dropped entirely.\n- **RL robustness**: Theoretically motivated but N=13 insufficient. Limitations disclosure, not claim.\n- **Detection as primary contribution**: Pivoted from \"we detect contamination\" to \"we characterize benchmark properties.\"\n\n\n## experiment_plan (with registry status)\n\n- id: plan_001\n  name: real_data_dif_mmlu\n  claim: 1\n  description: \"Apply DIF analysis to METABENCH MMLU response matrix (5,219 models\\\n    \\ × 12,508 items).

你是一位经验丰富的 ML 研究者。基于以下研究信息，为 Dream 模拟定义三档场景。

你需要同时定义 best / median / worst 三档：
1. 每档的核心假设（哪些假设成立/不成立）
2. 每档的关键实验指标预期范围（确保 best ≥ median ≥ worst 一致性）
3. 每档的论文叙事方向——
   - best: 原始 framing 完全成立，claims 无需调整
   - median: 部分假设未完全验证，需要调整 claims 强度或补充实验
   - worst: 核心假设不成立，需要找到新的 angle 来 reframe（但仍冲同一 venue，不降级目标）

三档的具体含义不预设——根据这个研究的 paper_framing、已有数据和方法特性
自行判断。但必须确保三档之间的数字和叙事逻辑一致。

# Project context
project: irt_equated_bench_regen
venue: emnlp-2026
focus: This is re-dream #8 after major revisions addressing Dream #7's specific weaknesses. Key improvements since Dream #7 (all integrated into paper via P6-P16 patches):

1. **Actionability paradox SOLVED** (was CW1-level concern): NEW plan_032 DIF-cleaned MMLU demonstration shows 89.5% models shift ≥5 ranks, systematic cohort bias (2024 Δrank=+73.6), confirmed DIF-specific by random baseline (z=8.5). This directly answers "ρ=0.997 means DIF doesn't matter."

2. **Proposition 1 (ΔFPR=0 formalized)**: Cross-subject matching now has a formal algebraic proof, not just an empirical observation. Elevates methodological contribution.

3. **Temporal coarseness addressed**: NEW plan_031 6-month window robustness check (C%=34.35%, 181× enrichment) shows DIF is robust to finer temporal granularity.

4. **Subject DIF direction asymmetry** (NEW analytical finding): STEM subjects favor 2024 models (55.4%), Humanities favor 2023 (64.4%) — content-level predictor of DIF direction.

5. **Expanded Related Work**: Added BHI (Blebea et al. 2024), PSN-IRT (Polo et al. 2024), Maeda (2024) — addresses "thin related work" concern.

6. **Systematic Confound Elimination narrative**: 6 negative results reframed as systematic exclusion of confounds (architecture, ability, local dependence, IRT misfit, reasoning-RL, ensemble), strengthening the "what remains is genuine temporal DIF" argument.

7. **Bootstrap CI on headline C%**: MMLU C%=31.3% [29.5%, 33.1%] with N=1000 model resampling.

8. **Causal language softened** throughout — "contamination-adjacent" phrasing replaced with hedged "differential functioning" language.

9. **DIF-for-LLMs paragraph** added in Discussion — explicitly addresses what DIF means for machine (vs. human) examinees.

10. **Audit protocol expanded** with code release commitment.

11. **ConStat/DVD comparison visibility increased** — AUROC numbers and Jaccard overlap now in main text.

Reviewers should evaluate whether these revisions close the gap from 3.5 to 4.0 (Conference). The paper's strongest path to 4.0: unprecedented scale + cross-subject matching (Proposition 1) + Simpson's paradox + DIF-cleaned demonstration (actionability) + 6-benchmark replication + systematic confound elimination.

## Core Claims (4 条, 可证伪)

**Claim 1 (Temporal Comparability Concern)**: ~31% of MMLU items are functionally unstable across model generations — they exhibit large DIF (ETS C, |Δ_MH|≥1.5) between 2023 and 2024-H1 model cohorts. Primary estimate: **31.3%** (temporal cohort, plan_001). All 57 subjects show instability (C% range 20.7–48.4%, unweighted mean ≈30%, plan_001 domain_specificity.csv). Within-subject matching on 5 high-C% subjects yields higher rates (31-45%, avg 38.1%, plan_014) — report as robustness check, not primary. This instability is not a statistical artifact (random split sanity check: 0.18%), and correlates weakly with domain-specific accuracy improvement (ρ=0.307, p=0.02), but item-level decomposition shows domain improvement explains only 2.4pp (7.6%). Architecture heterogeneity is a non-issue: METABENCH MMLU is 99.98% decoder-only (5226/5227), excluding the 1 non-decoder model changes nothing (Jaccard=1.0). Threshold sensitivity robustness confirmed: C% ranges from 48.9% (|Δ_MH|≥1.0) to 18.3% (|Δ_MH|≥2.0) to 10.2% (|Δ_MH|≥2.5). BH FDR correction at q=0.05 has negligible impact (removes 3/3,918 items).
- Evidence: plan_001 (C%=31.3%), plan_014 (within-subject C%=38.1%), plan_010 (arch-stratified: 99.98% decoder-only, C% unchanged, Jaccard=1.0), plan_018 (threshold: 49/31/18/10% at 1.0/1.5/2.0/2.5; BH negligible), plan_019 (decomposition: ≤2.4pp/7.6% explained by domain improvement), plan_022 (model independence: graduated de-duplication to 1 model per family → C% ≤ random subsample control at every cap K; K=20: 29.1% vs random 30.9%, K=5: 11.7% vs random 16.9%; family structure does NOT inflate C%), plan_027 (temporal ability overlap: d=-0.17, OVL=76.4%; 1:1 NN matching C%=28.9%±0.1% vs full 31.3% — ability confound explains only 2.4pp; contrast with Llama-2v3 d=-0.99→matched C%=28.3%, where ability confound explains 33pp)
- Honesty requirement: ρ=0.307 (p=0.02) at subject level reflects a modest ecological correlation. Item-level decomposition (plan_019) shows domain improvement accounts for at most 2.4pp of 31.3% C% (7.6%; pseudo R²=0.0007). The instability is predominantly item-specific. Caveat: item difficulty may be a mediator rather than confounder — use Model 1 as primary; Model 2 (Simpson's paradox) as supplementary.
- IRT fit: 98% of models show |Lz|>2, reflecting MMLU's inherent multidimensionality (57 subjects), not architecture heterogeneity. 1D IRT is fundamentally misspecified for MMLU — discuss in limitations as motivation for future multidimensional IRT work.

**Claim 2 (Ground Truth Meta-critique)**: Existing contamination detection literature validates against web-overlap/n-gram labels that measure global exposure (whether an item is publicly accessible), not differential contamination (whether an item functions differently across model cohorts). DIF enrichment≈1.0 against Li et al. labels is expected, not failure — these labels cannot evaluate item-level differential detectors. This is a fundamental validation methodology gap: all work using web-overlap labels as ground truth for item-level detectors (including Min-K%, n-gram methods) has the same blind spot. **Empirically validated** (plan_026): direct comparison of DIF-C flags vs Li et al. web-overlap labels on 9,229 MMLU items shows enrichment=0.964, Jaccard=0.206, Phi=0.012, χ²=1.28 (p=0.258), OR=1.05 [0.96, 1.15]. Consistent across subtypes (input_only: 0.986, input_and_label: 0.960). Semi-synthetic injection confirms DIF can detect differential contamination (ΔTPR=+0.508 at p=0.5, dose-response from p=0.3 to p=1.0).
- Evidence: plan_001 (enrichment=0.96), plan_026 (direct comparison: enrichment=0.964, Jaccard=0.206, p=0.258), plan_011 (ΔTPR=+0.508, dose-response)
- Framing: aggressive — "the field's standard validation approach is fundamentally mismatched for item-level detection" — now with direct empirical evidence, not just conceptual argument

**Claim 3 (Semi-synthetic Validation Framework)**: The ΔTPR methodology — injecting known differential contamination into real response matrices and measuring detection power increase — provides a controlled validation infrastructure for any item-level contamination detector. Cross-subject matching (using total score on OTHER subjects as MH matching variable) eliminates FPR inflation (ΔFPR=0.000 across all 5 tested subjects), while within-subject matching suffers from matching variable contamination (FPR inflation +0.186).
- Evidence: plan_011, plan_016 (ΔFPR=0.000 cross-subject, 4/5 subjects ΔTPR>0.3), plan_004 Step 2 (GSM8K ΔTPR=+0.818 standard, +0.517 external)
- Cross-benchmark: GSM8K replication confirms framework portability to single-domain math benchmarks
- Positioning: cross-subject matching is a practical methodological recommendation; cross-benchmark replication strengthens generalizability

**Claim 4 (Downstream Impact — Four-Layer Finding)**: DIF as diagnostic lens, not quality filter. Four sub-findings:
1. **Benchmark redundancy**: ρ≈0.997 between full and stable-only rankings — MMLU rankings are extremely robust to 31% item removal, revealing massive measurement redundancy in the benchmark.
2. **DIF items carry cross-cohort signal but are NOT the most ranking-defining items**: DIF removal causes MORE disruption than random removal (z=-8 to -49σ, 21/21 conditions), confirming DIF items are non-trivial. But circularity ablation (plan_020) shows DIF is the LEAST disruptive non-random strategy: accuracy-gap removal disrupts 10-16× more (z=-157 vs -9.5), high-variance 11× more (z=-108), high-discrimination 1.7× more (z=-16). MH's ability conditioning filters out raw accuracy differences, isolating genuine differential functioning rather than generally informative items. DIF-discrimination overlap is only 22.1% (Jaccard=0.12) — DIF identifies "items that changed across generations," not "good items."
3. **DIF as diagnostic lens**: DIF identifies which items' functioning changes most across model generations → reveals which capability dimensions drive ranking shifts. Not "find bad items and remove" but "understand what changed and why." Model-specific patterns: phi-3/llama-3 gain +700-850 ranks from DIF items, mistral merges lose -400 to -587. **Item characterization** (plan_023): DIF-C items are moderately harder (Cohen's d=-0.247) and higher-discrimination (d=0.230) than non-DIF items, but uniformly distributed across MMLU domains (χ² p=0.32). Key finding: difficulty × DIF direction interaction (ρ=-0.597) — hardest-decile DIF-C items are 88.7% focal-favoring (2024 models do better), easiest-decile are 96.2% reference-favoring (2023 models do better). This reveals a systematic pattern: capability improvement concentrates on hard items, while easy items' difficulty structure erodes across generations.
4. **Cross-benchmark validation (exploratory)**: On GSM8K (1,319 items × 6,702 models), DIF flags anti-correlate with GSM1K contamination gap (r=−0.478, p=0.005, N=33). **DEMOTED to exploratory** per Dream #6 three-tier consensus: N=33, CI wide [−0.71, −0.16], not strong enough for numbered contribution. This evidence is suggestive but should NOT appear in abstract/conclusion as core support.
- Evidence: plan_017 (z=-8 to -49σ, ρ=0.996-0.999), plan_020 (circularity ablation: DIF z=-9.5 vs acc-gap z=-157, disc z=-16, var z=-108), plan_023 (item characterization: difficulty ρ=-0.597, domain uniformity χ² p=0.32)
- Architecture: plan_017 is load-bearing (strong, full N=5,227). plan_020 circularity ablation is the second pillar. GSM1K correlation (plan_004 Step 3) is supplementary/exploratory only.
- Growing Pains互补: "Growing Pains uses anchor items for efficient evaluation; our DIF diagnostic tells them which anchor items are degrading"
- Caveats (→ limitations): N=33, Pearson CI upper bound |r|=0.155 (small effect possible), Spearman CI upper bound |ρ|=0.031 (near zero possible); item difficulty confound not fully excluded (DIF-C items harder for all models); contamination gap is proxy, not ground truth; replication with larger matched sample needed

## Story Spine (v2 — no-pivot narrative)

**Opening frame**: LLM benchmarks implicitly assume temporal score comparability — when we say "Model B outperforms Model A on MMLU," we presume both scores reflect the same latent construct. But do they? Psychometrics has a mature tool for testing exactly this: Differential Item Functioning (DIF) analysis detects items whose difficulty changes across examinee groups after controlling for overall ability. We apply MH-DIF to the METABENCH response matrix (5,227 models × 12,508 MMLU items) — the largest-scale DIF analysis on LLM benchmarks to date.

**Key narrative principle**: "Instability ≠ invalidity." DIF flags items whose functioning changed across generations — this is a diagnostic signal, not a quality verdict. MMLU rankings are massively redundant (ρ≈0.997 after removing 31% of items), so instability doesn't threaten validity. But it reveals WHICH capability dimensions are shifting. **This framing must appear in the Introduction, not be deferred to Discussion.**

**What we find** (4 contributions, focused):

1. **31% of MMLU items are functionally unstable** across model generations (ETS C, |Δ_MH|≥1.5). Robust to threshold choice (49%/31%/18%/10% at 1.0/1.5/2.0/2.5), multiple testing (BH removes 3/3918 items), and architecture composition (99.98% decoder-only). Domain accuracy improvement explains ≤2.4pp of 31.3% C% (7.6%; pseudo R²=0.0007). The instability is predominantly item-specific, not a proxy for "models got better."

2. **Ground truth meta-critique**: Web-overlap contamination labels measure global exposure, not differential contamination. Enrichment≈1.0 is expected. Semi-synthetic injection confirms DIF detects differential contamination (ΔTPR=+0.508). Any item-level detector validated against web-overlap labels has this blind spot.

3. **Semi-synthetic validation framework**: ΔTPR methodology with cross-subject matching (ΔFPR=0.000). Portable across benchmarks (GSM8K ΔTPR=+0.818). Reusable for validating any item-level contamination detector.

4. **DIF as diagnostic lens + actionable protocol**: DIF items carry cross-cohort signal (z=-8 to -49σ vs random) but are the LEAST disruptive non-random strategy (z=-9.5 vs accuracy-gap z=-157). DIF isolates genuine differential functioning, not just informative items. **Actionable contribution**: DIF audit protocol for benchmark maintainers (monitoring frequency, decision rules, response options).

**Headline result**: "Psychometric DIF analysis of 5,227 models × 12,508 MMLU items reveals 31% temporal instability — robust across thresholds, not driven by capability improvement (≤7.6%), and not a validity threat (ρ≈0.997 ranking stability). The field's web-overlap ground truth cannot capture this differential signal; we provide a semi-synthetic validation framework with cross-subject matching (ΔFPR=0.000). DIF serves as a diagnostic lens for understanding what changed across model generations, with a concrete audit protocol for benchmark maintenance."

## Scope Control (main body vs appendix)

**MAIN BODY (4 claims + robustness)**:
- §1 Introduction (problem + "instability ≠ invalidity" framing upfront)
- §2 Related Work (45 papers, 5 clusters)
- §3 Method (MH-DIF primer, semi-synthetic framework, cross-subject matching)
- §4 Experiments: Claim 1 (temporal DIF + threshold + BH + decomposition + architecture), Claim 2 (enrichment + meta-critique), Claim 3 (semi-synthetic + cross-benchmark), Claim 4 (redundancy + circularity ablation + diagnostic lens + GSM1K validation)
- §5 Discussion + Limitations
- §6 Conclusion

**APPENDIX (pruned from main body)**:
- Bayesian cumulative DIF (plan_007) — simulation-only, underdeveloped
- RL robustness (plan_002) — N=13, underpowered
- Ensemble fusion (plan_003a/b/c) — negative, not executed
- Bifactor equating pilot — below target fit
- Item generation pilot — below benchmarks
- Graceful degradation — clean but supplementary
- Item-Focused Trees — robustness check, supplementary
- ConStat/DVD comparisons — complementary baselines

## Empirical Observation: Structural Constraints on DIF in LLM Benchmarks

Systematic experimentation reveals that three structural improvements — matched-ability cohort design (plan_001b), IRT θ-conditioning (plan_012, r=0.9986), and bifactor pre-check (plan_014, within-subject C%=38.1%) — all fail to reduce temporal DIF baseline FPR below 31% while maintaining detection power. This is an empirical observation, not a formal impossibility result. The constraints arise from: (a) unidimensional IRT limitations in modeling 57-subject multidimensional ability, (b) statistical power requirements (N≥80, δ≥1.4), and (c) inability to separate ability confounding from genuine item-level changes. Higher-level methods (MIMIC, propensity-score matching, multidimensional IRT) may address individual constraints — future work.

## Venue Fit

- **EMNLP 2026**: Strong fit — NLP evaluation methodology is a dedicated area, reviewers expect empirical studies of benchmarks. "Empirical, not algorithmic" contribution type well-received. Risk: 8-page limit requires significant compression (current 10 pages). Mitigation: move structural analysis details to appendix.

## Novelty Articulation (三层，显式化)

MH-DIF (1959/1988) is applied without modification. **Explicitly acknowledge this.** Novelty is NOT algorithmic. Three layers of genuine contribution:

1. **Empirical discovery at unprecedented scale**: First DIF analysis on 5,227×12,508 LLM response matrix. Finding: 31% temporal instability is robust across thresholds (10-49%), not explained by capability improvement (≤7.6%), and architecturally homogeneous (99.98% decoder-only). No prior work has characterized item-level stability of LLM benchmarks at this scale. The instability finding itself is new data about MMLU's measurement properties.

2. **Ground truth meta-critique with field-wide implications**: The observation that web-overlap labels cannot validate item-level differential detectors is NOT obvious — the field routinely uses them. This affects the validity claims of Min-K%, ConStat, n-gram methods, and all papers using web-overlap as ground truth. First empirical demonstration (enrichment≈1.0 + semi-synthetic proof).

3. **Semi-synthetic validation framework + cross-subject matching**: The ΔTPR methodology is a reusable infrastructure contribution. Cross-subject matching (ΔFPR=0.000) is a novel practical innovation — the insight that within-subject matching contaminates the conditioning variable is subtle and general. Portable to any multi-domain benchmark (demonstrated on GSM8K).

**Framing**: "We bring mature psychometric tools to characterize an urgent ML evaluation problem. The contribution is the empirical findings, the validation methodology critique, and the reusable framework — not a new algorithm."

## Anticipated Reviewer Concerns (updated for pivot)

1. **"31% could just mean models got better / ability confound inflates C%"** — ✅ RESOLVED (plan_019 + plan_027). Item-level decomposition shows domain improvement explains ≤2.4pp of 31.3% C% (7.6%; pseudo R²=0.0007). Temporal cohort ability gap is negligible (d=-0.17, OVL=76.4%); 1:1 NN matching (d≈-0.01) yields C%=28.9%±0.1% vs full 31.3% — ability confound explains only 2.4pp. Contrast: Llama-2v3 (d=-0.99) drops from 61.3% to 28.3% under matching. Both converge to ~28-29% genuine item-level DIF.

2. **"Ground truth critique is obvious — of course web labels don't capture differential effects"** — Not obvious: the field routinely uses these labels for item-level validation. We provide the first empirical demonstration with both the enrichment≈1.0 result and the semi-synthetic proof of concept.

3. **"Semi-synthetic injection is artificial"** — We inject into real response matrices (not simulated), preserving real ability distributions and item characteristics. The mechanism (incorrect→correct flipping) is a simplification acknowledged in limitations.

4. **"DIF power is only sufficient for large effects"** — Large effects are precisely what threaten benchmark validity most. Operational region: N≥80, δ≥1.4, TPR=0.68-0.80.

5. **"Only validated on MMLU"** — Partially addressed: GSM8K replication (METABENCH 1,319 items × 6,702 models) confirms semi-synthetic framework portability (ΔTPR=+0.818) and temporal DIF pattern (C%=18.9%). **plan_028 in progress**: checking METABENCH for ARC/HellaSwag/WinoGrande/TruthfulQA response matrices to run multi-benchmark temporal DIF. Full generalization to diverse benchmarks remains future work if METABENCH lacks other benchmarks.

6. **"Higher methods (MIMIC, propensity-score) could solve the confounding"** — Acknowledged as future work. We frame our three-attempt negative results as "empirical observation" that motivates these directions, not as impossibility.

7. **"ETS threshold is uncalibrated for LLM populations"** — ✅ RESOLVED (plan_018). C% at {1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5} = {48.9%, 31.3%, 18.3%, 10.2%}. Finding >15% holds at standard thresholds [1.0, 2.0]. At conservative 2.5, still 10.2% (1,278 items). Present as: "finding is robust across standard thresholds; even at the most conservative cutoff, >10% of items show large DIF." Do NOT claim ">15% at all thresholds" — be honest that 2.5 drops below.

8. **"Multiple testing: 12,508 simultaneous tests without correction"** — ✅ RESOLVED (plan_018). BH FDR correction at q=0.05 removes only 3/3,918 ETS C items (31.32%→31.30%). At higher thresholds, BH impact is zero. ETS dual requirement (effect size + significance) provides near-complete implicit protection. Random-split sanity check (C%=0.18%) confirms empirically.

9. **"Only uniform DIF — non-uniform DIF plausible for LLMs"** — ✅ RESOLVED (plan_021). LR-DIF on 9 subjects (1787 items): MH C-class 92.1% concordance with LR uniform DIF → MH detection robust. Non-uniform DIF: 38.7% at significance threshold, **24.8% at |β_interaction|≥0.5** (conservative, effect-size controlled). MH structurally underestimates instability. Caveat: LR used within-subject matching (vs MH's cross-benchmark), so 38.7% may be inflated; use 24.8% in paper. Framing: "our 31% uniform-only estimate is conservative."

10. **"5,227 models are not independent — fine-tunes/merges inflate N and DIF significance"** — ✅ RESOLVED (plan_022). Graduated de-duplication (capping models per family at K=1,2,5,10,20) shows C% ≤ random subsample control at every cap: K=20 (447 models) C%=29.1% vs random 30.9%; K=5 (146 models) C%=11.7% vs random 16.9%; K=1 (33 families) C%=0.17% (underpowered, N<80). Family structure does NOT inflate C% — if anything, de-duplication reduces it slightly less than random subsampling. The 31.3% figure is robust to model non-independence.

11. **"Ranking disruption result is tautological"** — ✅ RESOLVED (plan_020). Circularity ablation shows DIF removal is the LEAST disruptive non-random strategy: z=-9.5 vs accuracy-gap z=-157, discrimination z=-16, variance z=-108. Despite 62.6% item overlap with accuracy-gap selection, MH ability conditioning makes DIF 10-16× less disruptive. DIF isolates genuine differential functioning, not just items with large raw group differences. Tautology refuted.

## Dropped from Original Framing

- **Ensemble (Claim 2 old)**: plan_003a/b/c never executed. Future work.
- **Regeneration (Claim 3 old)**: Bifactor killed by plan_014 pre-check. Dropped entirely.
- **RL robustness**: Theoretically motivated but N=13 insufficient. Limitations disclosure, not claim.
- **Detection as primary contribution**: Pivoted from "we detect contamination" to "we characterize benchmark properties."

<details><summary>Logged reasoning block</summary>

```text
The user wants me to define three tiers (best/median/worst) for a Dream simulation of their IRT-equated benchmark regeneration project targeting EMNLP 2026. I need to analyze the research context deeply and produce a single YAML block.

Let me think about what the key assumptions and metrics are for this paper:

**Core assumptions to evaluate:**
1. Temporal DIF (31% C%) is genuine item-level instability, not an artifact of ability confounding or model non-independence
2. Cross-subject matching eliminates FPR inflation (ΔFPR=0)
3. Ground truth meta-critique is accepted as a contribution (web-overlap labels can't validate item-level differential detectors)


4. Semi-synthetic validation framework is accepted as methodologically sound
5. DIF-cleaned MMLU demonstration shows actionable impact (89.5% models shift ≥5 ranks)
6. 6-benchmark replication generalizes the finding
7. Systematic confound elimination narrative is convincing
8. Proposition 1 (ΔFPR=0 formalization) elevates the contribution
9. The "instability ≠ invalidity" framing is accepted
10. The paper can be compressed to 8 pages without losing critical content

**Key metrics to track:**
- Reviewer scores (targeting 4.0 Conference)
- Citation potential and methodological novelty
- Whether the ground truth critique lands as a genuine contribution
- Actionability of the DIF-cleaned results
- How well the findings generalize across benchmarks
- Whether the page compression preserves the core argument

**Scenario analysis:**

In the best case, all four major claims resonate—reviewers buy the scale argument, recognize the meta-critique as a real contribution, value the semi-synthetic framework, and see the DIF diagnostic lens as novel. The confound elimination story holds up and scores land at 4.0+.

In a median outcome, some resistance emerges. The ground truth meta-critique might feel obvious to certain reviewers, or the semi-synthetic injection could be questioned as too artificial. The "instability ≠ invalidity" framing partially lands but reviewers push for deeper causal analysis, resulting in 3.5-4.0 scores that require a strong rebuttal.

In the worst case, the core claims face fundamental pushback.

Reviewers might argue that DIF is just capturing trivial model improvement despite the decomposition evidence, or that MH-DIF is too simplistic for LLM populations. The paper would need substantial reframing, though still targeting EMNLP with a different angle.

Now I'm looking at the specific metrics from the experiments to ground these scenarios in actual numbers.

The key insight is that this "Dream simulation" isn't really about hypothetical scenarios—it's about how reviewers will interpret the existing evidence and whether the planned follow-up experiments (like the permutation null test and RL robustness checks) succeed or fail. I need to define metrics that connect the observed results to reviewer reception, like whether the 31% instability gets accepted as genuine, what the expected reviewer scores would be, and how the narrative might need to shift based on those outcomes.

Writing YAML structure...
