(2025) show 31% of downstream conclusions are already incorrect. Researchers lack diagnostic tools to answer: (a) which annotation error structures propagate bias under their causal design, and (b) how robust their conclusions are to annotation error. Kim et al. (ICML 2025) show cross-model errors are highly correlated (60% agreement when both err), meaning ensembles cannot escape systematic bias — researchers MUST analyze the error structure of their chosen annotator, which is exactly what our tools enable.\n\n- **Existing approaches & gaps**: Wood-Doughty et al. (2018) apply DAG reasoning to text classifier errors but produce no formal bias theorems (binary only). TeBlunthuis et al. (2024) provide the most complete binary treatment with MLA correction but are limited to K=2, single classifier. Lee & Wood-Doughty (2024) extend to categorical + LLM classifiers but cover only 1 DAG topology (unobserved confounding), with no systematic taxonomy or sensitivity analysis. VanderWeele & Li (2019) provide sensitivity bounds but only for binary risk ratios. Jerzak et al. (EMNLP 2025) benchmark correction methods but treat error as monolithic — if different confusion matrix structures produce qualitatively different bias in different DAG topologies, unconditional benchmarking is itself misleading.\n\n- **Our framing**: Multi-class annotation errors are not created equal. The same confusion matrix that produces innocuous residual bias in one DAG topology can produce direction-reversing toxic bias in another. We provide the first systematic characterization of this interaction (the taxonomy), a tool to quantify robustness (ASVs), and guidance for when/how to correct (the framework). This is not a new correction method — it is the missing diagnostic layer that tells researchers which correction is appropriate, or whether correction is needed at all.\n\n- **Headline result template**: \"Across 6 DAG topologies with K=3,5,7, our bias expressions correctly predict bias direction and magnitude within 95% MC confidence intervals. On 3 CSS tasks annotated by 3 LLMs, ASVs provide calibrated robustness indicators, and our taxonomy identifies cases where commonly applied corrections would increase rather than decrease bias.\"\n\n## Core Insight (Lead Finding)\n\nThe binary guarantee that \"non-differential misclassification biases toward the null\" breaks in the multi-class case (Brenner 1993). But Brenner only identifies the danger without resolving the ambiguity. Our taxonomy resolves it: for each {confusion matrix structure × DAG topology} cell, we provide exact conditions determining when bias attenuates, amplifies, or reverses. Furthermore, the natural \"fix\" of binarizing a K-class variable is itself hazardous — collapsing categories introduces new, direction-unpredictable bias (demonstrated in MVP: Δ up to 0.089 between K=3 and binarized estimates).\n\n## MVP Evidence\n\nConfounding DAG + K=3 validated:\n- Theoretical bias expressions match MC perfectly (5/5 structures within 95% CI)\n- All non-differential C structures produce positive bias 0.20-0.30 (toward OVB)\n- Binary collapse produces different bias (max Δ=0.089)\n- 100k random C search: confounding DAG bias is monotonically toward OVB (no direction reversal in this topology)\n- Direction reversal expected in mediator/collider topologies — research phase priority\n\n## Venue Fit Risks\n\n- **AAAI**: Broad AI audience — emphasize general methodology for \"automated annotation measurement error,\" not LLM-specific.

Must serve both.\n\n## Anticipated Reviewer Concerns & Planned Responses\n\n1. **\"Trivial extension of binary to multi-class\"** → Brenner (1993) proved direction reversal; our taxonomy provides the first systematic characterization across 6 topologies. Binarizing K-class introduces NEW unpredictable bias (MVP evidence). The complexity jump is structural: binary has 2 free parameters (sensitivity, specificity) → scalar bias; K=5 has 20 free parameters → matrix-valued bias requiring eigendecomposition for interpretation. [Experiments: plan_001, plan_008]\n\n2. **\"Lee & Wood-Doughty (2024) already did categorical\"** → They cover 1 topology (unobserved confounding) on 1 dataset (MIMIC). We cover 6 topologies with systematic taxonomy + ASVs + correction guidance. Their work is a stepping stone; ours is the full framework. [Experiments: plan_001]\n\n3. **\"Why these 6 DAG topologies?\"** → These are the canonical CSS causal designs used by Hernán & Cole (2009) and TeBlunthuis et al. (2024). They cover the major roles an annotated variable can play: confounder, mediator, collider, instrument, front-door criterion variable. [Experiments: plan_001]\n\n4. **\"K≥5 expressions aren't actionable\"** → Three interpretability tools: (a) eigendecomposition summaries identifying dominant bias modes, (b) worst-case scalar bounds, (c) diagnostic visualizations. [Experiments: plan_002]\n\n5. **\"ASV sharpness only proved for 3 topologies\"** → Honest scoping reflecting algebraic complexity. Remaining 3 validated via MC with numerical sharpness evidence. Full proofs identified as immediate future work. [Experiments: plan_004, plan_005]\n\n6. **\"Correlated multi-LLM errors?\"** → Kim et al. (ICML 2025) actually STRENGTHENS our case: if ensembles can't fix errors (60% agreement when both err), error structure analysis is the only viable approach. Multi-annotator correction with dependence is identified as an open problem. [Framework discussion]\n\n7. **\"Empirical validation scope\"** → 3 CSS tasks × 3 LLMs × 3 DAG-relevant scenarios.

## Title
Multi-Class Annotation Errors Are Not Created Equal: Bias Taxonomy, Sensitivity Analysis, and Correction Guidance for LLM-Annotated Causal Studies

## Core Claims (3 条)

1. **Multi-class bias taxonomy**: For K≥3 annotation variables, the direction and magnitude of downstream bias depend on the interaction between the K×K confusion matrix structure and the DAG topology — breaking guarantees that hold in the binary case. We provide closed-form bias expressions for K=3 and matrix-form expressions with interpretability tools for general K, across 6 canonical social-science DAG topologies (confounding, mediation, collider, M-bias, instrument, front-door).

2. **Annotation Sensitivity Values (ASVs)**: A sensitivity analysis framework for annotation-induced bias. ASVs quantify the minimum degree of differential annotation error needed to overturn a downstream conclusion, parameterized by a reference confusion matrix and amplification factor δ. Reported alongside estimates, analogous to E-values for unmeasured confounding. Formal proofs (monotonicity + sharpness) for 3 priority topologies; MC-validated conjectures for the remaining 3.

3. **Correction guidance framework**: A principled decision framework mapping {DAG topology × error structure × ASV} to the appropriate correction method (DSL, PPI, MLA, naive plug-in), characterizing regimes where each applies and where no existing method suffices — including dependence-aware multi-LLM correction as an open problem.

## Story Spine

- **Problem**: LLMs are rapidly replacing human annotators in CSS, but Baumann et al. (2025) show 31% of downstream conclusions are already incorrect. Researchers lack diagnostic tools to answer: (a) which annotation error structures propagate bias under their causal design, and (b) how robust their conclusions are to annotation error. Kim et al. (ICML 2025) show cross-model errors are highly correlated (60% agreement when both err), meaning ensembles cannot escape systematic bias — researchers MUST analyze the error structure of their chosen annotator, which is exactly what our tools enable.

- **Existing approaches & gaps**: Wood-Doughty et al. (2018) apply DAG reasoning to text classifier errors but produce no formal bias theorems (binary only). TeBlunthuis et al. (2024) provide the most complete binary treatment with MLA correction but are limited to K=2, single classifier. Lee & Wood-Doughty (2024) extend to categorical + LLM classifiers but cover only 1 DAG topology (unobserved confounding), with no systematic taxonomy or sensitivity analysis. VanderWeele & Li (2019) provide sensitivity bounds but only for binary risk ratios. Jerzak et al. (EMNLP 2025) benchmark correction methods but treat error as monolithic — if different confusion matrix structures produce qualitatively different bias in different DAG topologies, unconditional benchmarking is itself misleading.

- **Our framing**: Multi-class annotation errors are not created equal. The same confusion matrix that produces innocuous residual bias in one DAG topology can produce direction-reversing toxic bias in another. We provide the first systematic characterization of this interaction (the taxonomy), a tool to quantify robustness (ASVs), and guidance for when/how to correct (the framework). This is not a new correction method — it is the missing diagnostic layer that tells researchers which correction is appropriate, or whether correction is needed at all.

- **Headline result template**: "Across 6 DAG topologies with K=3,5,7, our bias expressions correctly predict bias direction and magnitude within 95% MC confidence intervals. On 3 CSS tasks annotated by 3 LLMs, ASVs provide calibrated robustness indicators, and our taxonomy identifies cases where commonly applied corrections would increase rather than decrease bias."

## Core Insight (Lead Finding)

The binary guarantee that "non-differential misclassification biases toward the null" breaks in the multi-class case (Brenner 1993). But Brenner only identifies the danger without resolving the ambiguity. Our taxonomy resolves it: for each {confusion matrix structure × DAG topology} cell, we provide exact conditions determining when bias attenuates, amplifies, or reverses. Furthermore, the natural "fix" of binarizing a K-class variable is itself hazardous — collapsing categories introduces new, direction-unpredictable bias (demonstrated in MVP: Δ up to 0.089 between K=3 and binarized estimates).

## MVP Evidence

Confounding DAG + K=3 validated:
- Theoretical bias expressions match MC perfectly (5/5 structures within 95% CI)
- All non-differential C structures produce positive bias 0.20-0.30 (toward OVB)
- Binary collapse produces different bias (max Δ=0.089)
- 100k random C search: confounding DAG bias is monotonically toward OVB (no direction reversal in this topology)
- Direction reversal expected in mediator/collider topologies — research phase priority

## Venue Fit Risks

- **AAAI**: Broad AI audience — emphasize general methodology for "automated annotation measurement error," not LLM-specific. Frame as extending classical measurement error theory to modern automated labeling.
- **ARR/NAACL**: NLP audience — CSS track is natural fit. May want more empirical NLP experiments. Balance theory with practical LLM annotation scenarios.
- **Cross-discipline bridge**: Epidemiology (measurement error theory) × NLP (annotation errors). Epi reviewers check proof rigor; NLP reviewers check empirical relevance. Must serve both.

```text
The user wants me to define three tiers (best/median/worst) for a Dream simulation of their causal annotation error attribution research project. Let me analyze the research context carefully.

Key elements:
1. The project studies how multi-class annotation errors propagate bias through different DAG topologies
2. Core uncertainty: will mediator/collider DAGs show direction reversal under non-differential multi-class error?
3. MVP validated confounding DAG (monotonic toward OVB, no reversal)
4. ASV framework usefulness vs just reporting confusion matrices
5. Target venue: AAAI 2027 (primary)


6. Best case would confirm direction reversal across all three priority topologies with clean ASV proofs and meaningful empirical variation. Median case would show reversal only in specific regimes with harder-to-prove monotonicity and more homogeneous LLM confusion matrices than hoped. Worst case would fail to demonstrate reversal or find the ASV framework doesn't add value beyond standard confusion matrices.

Now I'm defining the specific metrics to track: direction reversal rate across topology and C structure combinations, how well Monte Carlo simulations match theory within confidence intervals, ASV coverage deviation from nominal levels, and whether ASV correctly flags vulnerable conclusions in practice.

The narrative hinges on what the results show—if direction reversal appears consistently in mediators and colliders with a clean taxonomy and complete proofs, that's the strongest story about how multi-class errors fundamentally differ from binary cases. If the pattern is messier or only holds under specific conditions, I'd need to reframe toward a more modest claim about systematic insights rather than complete characterization.

The weakest scenario is if non-differential error doesn't produce clean reversals, which would force me to pivot the contribution: either emphasizing that differential error (the realistic LLM regime based on prior work) is where the danger lies, or leading with binarization collapse and ASV as a practical tool instead.

Now I'm checking that the metrics scale consistently across these three scenarios.

      原始 framing 完全成立。标题主张 "Multi-class errors are not created equal" 有跨拓扑方向反转的硬证据支撑。

      taxonomy_cells_with_qualitative_difference: [0.35, 0.55]  # 不同拓扑之间定性差异存在但不如预期丰富
    narrative_direction: >
      Claims 需要调整强度。Claim 1 从 "完整 taxonomy" 调整为 "系统性框架，揭示关键拓扑间的定性差异"，
      承认部分拓扑（如 instrument/front-door）行为与 confounding 类似而非产生新洞见。
      Claim 2 诚实界定 ASV 的证明范围（"3 个拓扑单调性 + 1-2 个紧致性证明，其余数值验证"），
      强调 ASV 作为实用工具的校准性能而非纯理论优雅。
      Claim 3 不变但补充实验：在 ASV 区分力有限的任务上，展示 correction guidance 仍提供正确建议。
      Headline 聚焦于被确认反转的拓扑："在 collider DAG 下，非差异性多类误差可反转效应方向，
      而现有二分类理论无法预测此行为。" 补充 binarization 风险作为第二支撑。
      可能需要增加 1 个补充实验（差异性误差条件下的扩展）以增厚贡献。

  worst:

    narrative_direction: >
      核心假设（非差异性多类误差打破二分类保证并产生拓扑依赖的方向反转）不成立。需要 reframe，但不降级 venue 目标。
      新 angle: "差异性误差是 LLM 标注的现实模式"（Kim et al. 2025 的相关性数据直接支持），
      将贡献重构为：(1) 证明非差异性条件下多类误差仍具有二分类不可预测的放大效应（虽非反转但量级不同），
      (2) 在差异性误差——LLM 的真实工作区间——下完成 taxonomy 和反转分析，
      (3) 将 ASV 重新定位为检测差异性误差风险的工具而非通用敏感性分析。
      标题可能调整为强调 "differential annotation error in LLM-based causal studies" 而非 "multi-class errors are not created equal"。
      Headline: "LLM 标注误差本质上是差异性的（Kim et al.），而差异性多类误差在 X 个拓扑下产生方向反转——
      我们提供首个系统刻画和诊断工具。" 这保持了 AAAI/ARR 的竞争力但将贡献从纯理论扩展转向 LLM 特异性实证发现。
      需要补充实验：用 plan_003 的经验 C 矩阵证明 LLM 误差确实是差异性的，并量化差异性程度。
