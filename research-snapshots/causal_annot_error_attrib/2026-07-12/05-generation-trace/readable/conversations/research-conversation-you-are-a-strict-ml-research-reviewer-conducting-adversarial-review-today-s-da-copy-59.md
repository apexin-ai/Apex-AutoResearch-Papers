  "content": "You are a strict ML research reviewer conducting adversarial review.\n\n**Today's date: 2026-05-18 (UTC).**\n\nYour job: independently verify this idea's claims via WebSearch, then issue a verdict.\n\n## User requirements\nThe user asked for: **Target: EMNLP 2026, ARR submission. Track: Machine Learning for NLP.\n\nDirection: All existing verified synthetic data methods assume a FIXED verifier, but Yi et al.\n(arXiv 2510.16657, Oct 2025) prove this creates an inescapable 'verifier ceiling' — the generator\nconverges to the verifier's knowledge center, not the true distribution, regardless of iteration\ncount. Nature 2024 establishes that even 0.1% synthetic contamination triggers model collapse.\nMeanwhile, pluralistic preference curation (arXiv 2605.07724, May 2026) preserves diversity but\nstill assumes fixed reward functions. No method jointly optimizes verifier quality AND data\nselection. We propose a co-evolutionary framework where the verifier improves alongside the\ngenerator — the generator's improving outputs serve as an increasingly challenging curriculum\nfor the verifier, creating a mutual improvement loop that provably escapes the ceiling bound.\nCoVerRL (arXiv 2603.17775, March 2026) demonstrates generator-verifier co-evolution in reasoning\nRL but without formal convergence guarantees and in a different setting.\n\nSeed Papers:\n- \"AI Models Collapse When Trained on Recursively Generated Data\" (Shumailov et al., Nature 2024)\n  — Establishes the problem: indiscriminate use of model-generated content causes irreversible\n  defects across LLMs, VAEs, and Gaussian mixtures. Tails of original distributions disappear.\n  Even 0.1% synthetic contamination triggers collapse. The seminal empirical motivation.\n- \"Escaping Model Collapse via Synthetic Data Verification\" (Yi et al., arXiv 2510.16657, Oct 2025)\n  — Theoretical anchor: proves verified synthetic data prevents collapse near-term BUT converges to\n  verifier's 'knowledge center' long-term. Unless verifier is perfectly reliable (r=1), gains\n  plateau. Characterizes the ceiling formally: θ_t converges to a point determined by verifier\n  reliability r, not the true θ*. The ceiling is tight under fixed r.\n- \"Beyond Model Collapse: Scaling Up with Synthesized Data Requires Verification\" (Fan et al., ICLR 2025, arXiv 2406.07515)\n  — Derives breakdown point p* for when verification prevents collapse using Gaussian mixtures and\n  linear classifiers. Critical assumption: FIXED verifier quality — does not address verifier\n  improvement.\n- \"Curated Synthetic Data Doesn't Have to Collapse: A Theoretical Study of Generative Retraining\n  with Pluralistic Preferences\" (arXiv 2605.07724, May 2026)\n  — Latest: shows multi-reward curation preserves diversity via weighted Nash bargaining. But\n  still assumes FIXED reward functions — does not address the ceiling when all rewards share\n  blind spots.\n- \"CoVerRL: Breaking the Consensus Trap via Generator-Verifier Co-Evolution\" (arXiv 2603.17775, March 2026)\n  — Demonstrates co-evolution in reasoning RL: generator and verifier improve jointly, breaking\n  performance plateaus. Key precedent but (1) no formal convergence guarantees, (2) applied to\n  reasoning RL, not general synthetic data curation, (3) does not formally connect to Yi et al.'s\n  ceiling bound.\n\nKnown Gaps:\n- No method jointly optimizes verifier quality AND data selection with formal convergence guarantees.\n- Yi et al.'s ceiling is tight for fixed r, but the escape path (making r_t increase with t)\n  is uncharacterized.\n- CoVerRL shows co-evolution works empirically but has no theory connecting to the verifier\n  ceiling bound.\n- Pluralistic preferences preserve diversity with fixed rewards but don't address the ceiling\n  when all rewards share blind spots.\n\nIn-scope: Co-evolutionary frameworks where the verifier's reliability r_t provably increases\nalongside generator improvement, with formal convergence guarantees showing the ceiling recedes.\nSpecifically: using the generator's improving outputs as a curriculum for verifier training\n(harder examples as the generator improves), maintaining verifier calibration during co-evolution\n(not just discrimination), formal analysis showing r_t → 1 or at least r_t → r* > r_0 under\nstated conditions, and empirical validation on language generation tasks (not just toy settings).\n\nNOT in-scope: Proposing yet another fixed-verifier filtering method (the ceiling result makes\nthis a dead end). GAN-style adversarial training without calibration guarantees (verifier must\nremain well-calibrated, not just discriminative). Evaluation only on toy settings (Gaussian\nmixtures, MNIST) without language model validation. Methods assuming unlimited fresh human-labeled\ndata (defeats the purpose of synthetic data).\n\nContribution type: METHOD + THEORETICAL ANALYSIS. The output must include (1) a co-evolutionary\nalgorithm with clear verifier update rules, (2) a formal proof or tight bound showing that\nco-evolution escapes Yi et al.'s ceiling under stated assumptions, and (3) empirical validation\non at least one language generation task demonstrating ceiling escape.\n\nEVAL PROTOCOL:\nTRAIN on: SmolLM2-135M/360M/1.7B as generator models. Verifier initialized from a separate\ncheckpoint of the same or larger model. Co-evolutionary loop: generate → verify → select →\nretrain generator → use generator's harder outputs to retrain verifier → repeat.\nEVALUATE on:\n- Primary metric: distribution divergence between generator's output distribution and true\n  data distribution across co-evolution rounds, compared against fixed-verifier baseline.\n  Must demonstrate ceiling escape (continued improvement where fixed-verifier plateaus).\n- Verifier reliability r_t trajectory: measure verifier accuracy on held-out evaluation\n  set at each co-evolution round — must show monotonic or near-monotonic improvement.\n- Text generation quality: perplexity on held-out data, MAUVE score (distribution matching),\n  n-gram diversity (Self-BLEU), tail coverage (measuring whether rare phenomena are preserved).\n- Summarization task: XSUM or CNN/DailyMail as a concrete language generation benchmark,\n  measuring ROUGE, faithfulness (FactScore), and diversity across co-evolution rounds.\n- Baseline comparisons:\n  1. No verification (pure synthetic recursion — the collapse baseline)\n  2. Fixed verifier (Yi et al.'s method — the ceiling baseline)\n  3. Periodic verifier retraining on fresh human data (naive co-evolution)\n  4. CoVerRL-style co-evolution adapted to generation (no formal guarantees)\n  5. Pluralistic fixed-reward curation (May 2026 baseline)\n- Ablation: generator curriculum for verifier vs. fixed verifier retraining data,\n  calibration maintenance mechanism vs. discrimination-only verifier\n- Convergence analysis: empirically measure the ceiling bound and demonstrate it shifts\n  upward with co-evolution rounds\n- Scale test: compare co-evolution dynamics at 135M vs. 1.7B scale\n\nBuilding blocks: SmolLM2-135M, SmolLM2-360M, SmolLM2-1.7B (HuggingFace); Yi et al.'s\nverification framework (arXiv 2510.16657); CoVerRL codebase (arXiv 2603.17775); XSUM dataset\n(EdinburghNLP/xsum); CNN/DailyMail (abisee/cnn_dailymail); MAUVE evaluation library\n(krishnap25/mauve-experiments); FactScore for faithfulness evaluation; HuggingFace transformers\n+ accelerate for training; DeepSpeed for efficient multi-round training loops; temperature\nscaling and Platt scaling libraries for verifier calibration.\n\nHARD CONSTRAINTS:\nCompute: ≤200 H100-hours total. Strategy: use small models (SmolLM2-135M/360M) for the\nmain co-evolutionary experiments — each training round is ~2-5 H100-hours, with 10-20 rounds\nneeded = ~50-100 H100-hours. Scale validation at 1.7B for 5 rounds (~50 H100-hours).\nBaselines and ablations (~50 H100-hours). Total ~150-200 H100-hours.\nEval: Must demonstrate ceiling escape on at least one language generation task (not just toy\nsettings). Must compare against Yi et al.'s fixed-verifier baseline. Must measure verifier\nreliability trajectory. Must include ≥4 baselines.\nMust report: distribution divergence curves, verifier reliability r_t trajectory, MAUVE\nscores, tail coverage, convergence rate comparison, ablation results.\n\nLook for: (1) Generator-as-curriculum for verifier: as the generator improves, its outputs\nbecome harder to distinguish from real data — use these as a natural difficulty progression\nfor verifier training. The key insight is that the generator's distribution shift creates\nincreasingly challenging examples without needing fresh human labels. Formally, if the\ngenerator moves from θ_t to θ_{t+1} closer to θ*, the verifier must improve its decision\nboundary to maintain accuracy, forcing r_t to increase. (2) Calibration-preserving co-evolution:\nstandard adversarial training (GANs) produces discriminative but poorly calibrated verifiers.\nFor ceiling escape, the verifier must maintain calibration (reliable probability estimates,\nnot just classification). Use temperature scaling or Platt scaling after each verifier\nupdate round, and prove that calibration maintenance is sufficient for ceiling escape under\nthe Yi et al. framework. (3) Formal escape bound derivation: extend Yi et al.'s fixed-r\nconvergence proof to the case where r_t is a function of t. The goal: prove that if\nr_t ≥ r_0 + f(t) for some increasing f, then θ_t converges to a neighborhood of θ* whose\nradius shrinks with the cumulative verifier improvement ∑f(t). This connects the rate of\nverifier improvement to the tightness of ceiling escape. (4) Pluralistic co-evolution: combine\nco-evolution with pluralistic preferences (May 2026) — use multiple co-evolving verifiers with\ndifferent specializations to avoid the problem of shared blind spots. If each verifier improves\non a different dimension, the joint ceiling is higher than any individual ceiling. (5) Early\nstopping and divergence detection: co-evolution can go wrong if the verifier overfits to\nthe generator's distribution rather than improving general reliability. Design a divergence\nmonitor that detects when r_t starts decreasing and triggers a corrective step (e.g.,\nre-injection of real data into verifier training).\n\nAvoid:\n- Assuming access to unlimited fresh human-labeled data — this defeats the purpose of synthetic\n  data. The method must work with a FIXED initial seed of human data plus the co-evolutionary loop.\n- GAN-style adversarial training without calibration guarantees — verifier must remain\n  well-calibrated, not just discriminative. An uncalibrated verifier may report high accuracy\n  but still produce a ceiling.\n- Toy-only evaluation (Gaussian mixtures, MNIST, linear regression) without language model\n  validation — Yi et al. already covered toy settings. The contribution must include ≥1\n  language generation task.\n- Ignoring the Yi et al. ceiling bound — the theoretical contribution MUST formally connect\n  to the ceiling. A method that \"just works empirically\" without explaining WHY it escapes\n  the bound is insufficient.\n- Naive periodic retraining as the proposed method — this is the obvious baseline. Must show\n  principled co-evolution (generator-as-curriculum, calibration maintenance) substantially\n  outperforms naive retraining.\n- Conflating verifier improvement with generator improvement — must separately track r_t\n  (verifier reliability) and θ_t (generator quality) and show both improve.\n- Ignoring CoVerRL — it's the closest existing work and must be explicitly compared against,\n  with clear differentiation (formal guarantees + general synthetic data, not just reasoning RL).\n\nIDEA GENERATION QUALITY CONSTRAINTS (hard rules from historical bad cases):\n\n1. No strawman problems: Any claim about \"current methods assume X\" or \"current methods\n   fail at Y\" MUST cite a specific paper with a specific passage as evidence. Do NOT\n   fabricate mainstream assumptions from pre-training knowledge. If you cannot find paper\n   evidence, the claim is invalid.\n\n2. No observation-only ideas: \"We discover that X happens\" is NOT a contribution.\n   Discovering a problem is not a contribution — solving it is. Output MUST include a\n   complete method, not an analysis/benchmark/empirical study.\n\n3. No mediocre methods: Your method MUST answer:\n   - Core Insight: What non-obvious structural property are you exploiting?\n     The generator's improving outputs create a natural difficulty curriculum for the verifier —\n     this mutual improvement loop can be formally shown to escape the fixed-verifier ceiling.\n   - Why Not Obvious: Why isn't this the first thing anyone would try?\n     The ceiling was only characterized in Oct 2025 (Yi et al.). Co-evolution in this context\n     requires solving the calibration maintenance problem (not present in standard GANs).\n     CoVerRL (March 2026) showed it works in reasoning RL but has no formal analysis.\n   - Information Exploited: What do you use that a naive baseline doesn't?\n     The generator's distribution shift as a signal for verifier curriculum — the generator\n     naturally produces harder examples as it improves, without needing external data.\n   - Mechanistic Argument: Yi et al. prove ceiling = f(r). If co-evolution makes r_t\n     increase monotonically, ceiling recedes. The generator-as-curriculum mechanism ensures\n     r_t improvement because the verifier is continuously challenged by harder examples.\n     Calibration maintenance ensures r_t improvement is real (not just discrimination).\n   If the method can be summarized in one sentence with zero counter-intuitive content → reject.\n\n4. No rehashing existing work: For every core technical component you propose, search with\n   at least 3 different queries to confirm no directly related work exists. If you find\n   1-2 papers doing similar things, you MUST explicitly state your specific differentiation.\n\n5. No experiment-padding disguise: An idea's value is NOT in how many experiments it can run.\n   Self-check with:\n   - \"Remove experiments test\": Delete all results, keep only method description — does it\n     teach the reader something non-trivial? Yes — the formal proof that co-evolution escapes\n     the ceiling is the contribution.\n   - \"Baseline fear test\": If naive periodic retraining achieves similar results, does this\n     paper still have value? Must show principled co-evolution substantially outperforms it.\n   - \"Citation test\": In 5 years, will people cite the numbers or the insight?\n     The insight — formal proof that co-evolution breaks the verifier ceiling.\n   If any test fails → the idea is garbage, start over.\n\n6. The following method patterns are REJECTED (unless extremely strong structural justification):\n   - \"Add an X module\" — Why this specific structure?\n   - \"Train on Y data\" — Is data construction itself the contribution?\n   - \"Transfer Z from domain A to B\" — What is the structural analogy between A and B?\n   - \"Combine P and Q\" — Where is the synergy? Why isn't it just 1+1=2?\n   - \"Use more/bigger/stronger X\" — Scaling is not a method contribution.\n\nCOMPETITION WARNING: CoVerRL (March 2026) is the closest competitor — demonstrates\ngenerator-verifier co-evolution in reasoning RL. Differentiation: we provide formal\nconvergence guarantees (CoVerRL has none) and address general synthetic data curation\n(not just reasoning RL). EvoSyn (arXiv 2510.17928) uses evolutionary data synthesis but\nwith fixed fitness functions. Generative Adversarial Reasoner (ICLR 2026) uses adversarial\ngenerator-verifier loops for reasoning. Self-Verification (NeurIPS 2025) proves self-verification\nprevents collapse but assumes a fixed self-verifier. The pluralistic preferences paper\n(May 2026) is complementary — their multi-reward approach could be combined with co-evolution.\nNo existing paper provides formal ceiling escape guarantees with co-evolution — this gap\nis confirmed open as of May 2026. Monitor: Yi et al.'s group for a co-evolution follow-up,\nCoVerRL authors for a theory paper, and the pluralistic preferences group.\n\nTag: direction=verified_synthetic_data_coevolution, contribution_type=method_with_theory,\nsub_direction=ceiling_escape_via_coevolution, target_venues=[\"EMNLP 2026\"].**\nYou MUST evaluate whether this idea actually meets the user's requirements.

The idea instead uses Qwen3-8B on math reasoning (MATH, GSM8K, AIME) with ECE/MCE metrics and targets ICLR 2027. This is a wholesale departure from the user's specification.\", \"MISSED CRITICAL COMPETING WORK — DCPO (arXiv 2603.09117, March 2026): DCPO already decouples calibration from accuracy in GRPO-based RL training, reducing ECE by 71.6% on Qwen3-8B. CalCoEvo's mechanism (1) — proper-scoring-rule-based calibration reward — directly overlaps with DCPO's approach. This paper is not cited or discussed.\", \"MISSED CRITICAL COMPETING WORK — RLCR/Beyond Binary Rewards (arXiv 2507.16806): Uses Brier score as calibration reward during RL training of reasoning models — essentially the same idea as CalCoEvo's mechanism (1).

Where is the synergy? The idea doesn't demonstrate why combining these produces more than the sum of parts.\"]\nFeedback: This idea drifted fundamentally from the user's requirements. To revise productively:\n\n1. **Return to the user's specification**: Use SmolLM2-135M/360M/1.7B as generators, evaluate on language generation tasks (XSUM/CNN-DailyMail), report MAUVE/perplexity/Self-BLEU/ROUGE/FactScore. The core problem — escaping the verifier ceiling in synthetic data curation — is distinct from calibration in math reasoning RL and has much less competition.\n\n2. **Differentiate from DCPO and RLCR**: These papers already solve 'calibration during RL training.' Your unique angle must be the *co-evolutionary synthetic data curation* setting per the user's direction — using the generator's improving outputs as curriculum for verifier training, with the verifier's improving quality enabling better data selection. This is fundamentally different from calibrating a single model's confidence.\n\n3. **Provide the formal result**: The user's key differentiator is formal ceiling escape guarantees. Extend Yi et al.'s fixed-r convergence proof to r_t = r_0 + f(t). State the theorem: 'If r_t ≥ r_0 + f(t) for increasing f, then θ_t converges to B(θ*, g(∑f(t))) where g is decreasing.' Then prove the generator-as-curriculum mechanism ensures r_t increases monotonically under stated conditions. This formal contribution is what separates the idea from CoVerRL (empirical only) and makes it publishable.\n\n4. **Address the timeline**: If EMNLP 2026 is truly the target, scope the experiments to what's achievable in ~200 H100-hours with SmolLM2-135M (fast training) over 7 days. Alternatively, explicitly propose a next-cycle ARR submission.\n\n5. **Cite and differentiate from**: DCPO (arXiv 2603.09117), RLCR (arXiv 2507.16806), Convergence Dynamics of Co-Evolving Models (arXiv 2503.08117), and Solver-Verifier Gap (arXiv 2507.00075, ICLR 2026). Your differentiation: these address calibration in single-model RL or abstract co-evolution, not calibrated co-evolutionary synthetic data curation with ceiling escape guarantees.\n\n### Round 2 review\nVerdict: revise\nIssues: [\"MISSED CRITICAL COMPETING WORK — G-Zero (arXiv 2605.09959, May 2026): Proposes verifier-free co-evolutionary self-play that explicitly targets escaping capability ceilings in open-ended generation. Has best-iterate suboptimality guarantees. While it takes a different approach (eliminating verifiers rather than co-evolving them), it addresses the same problem and must be discussed as an alternative paradigm. Its existence weakens the claim that co-evolving the verifier is the only path to ceiling escape.\", \"MISSED CRITICAL RELATED WORK — Chen et al. 'Learning to Self-Verify' (arXiv 2602.07594, Feb 2026): Demonstrates a fundamental asymmetry: improving generation does NOT lead to improved self-verification, but improving verification DOES improve generation. This directly challenges the 'generator-as-curriculum' mechanism which assumes improving generator outputs create harder verification tasks that force verifier improvement. If this asymmetry holds in the co-evolution setting, the mutual reinforcement condition may not be satisfiable.\", \"MISSED RELATED WORK — Chojecki 'Self-Improving AI Agents through Self-Play' (arXiv 2512.02731, Dec 2025): Formalizes generator-verifier-updater (GVU) dynamics and derives a 'Variance Inequality' — a spectral stability condition for self-improving systems. The proposed formal contribution must relate to or improve upon this existing framework.\", \"NAME COLLISION: 'CoEvolve' is already used by arXiv 2604.15840 (April 2026) — 'CoEvolve: Training LLM Agents via Agent-Data Mutual Evolution.' Must rename to avoid confusion in the literature.\", \"AUTHOR ATTRIBUTION ERROR: First key reference cites 'Beyond Model Collapse' (ICLR 2025) as 'Yi et al.' but actual authors are Feng, Dohmatob, Yang, Charton, and Kempe. Yi et al. authored the separate paper arXiv 2510.16657.\", \"VENUE STATUS ERROR: Yi et al. (arXiv 2510.16657) is listed as an arXiv preprint but was actually accepted at ICLR 2026 — this is a stronger citation than presented.\", \"GENERATOR-AS-CURRICULUM MECHANISM CHALLENGED: The formal argument relies on a 'mutual reinforcement condition' where improving generator outputs force the verifier to improve. Chen et al. (2602.07594) empirically demonstrate the opposite direction: generation improvement does not drive verification improvement. The paper must either (1) provide formal conditions under which the asymmetry is resolved in the co-evolution setting, or (2) modify the mechanism to account for one-directional coupling.\", \"EMNLP 2026 PRIMARY TARGET INFEASIBLE: The deadline (May 25, 2026) is 7 days away. A formal convergence proof plus SmolLM2 experiments at three scales on two datasets with five baselines cannot be completed in this timeframe. The idea acknowledges EACL 2027 and ICLR 2027 as fallbacks, but the primary target should be realistic.\", \"POTENTIAL COUNTEREVIDENCE: 'Data Recipes for Reasoning Models' (ICLR 2026) shows that verification filtering does not improve over no filtering in single-pass SFT regimes. While this applies to a different setting (single-pass vs. iterative), the idea should discuss why iterative co-evolutionary verification is valuable when single-pass verification may not be.\", \"PROOF RISK: The formal theorem requires proving Δ_t ≤ Δ_0·q^t (geometric contraction of verifier bias). The sketch assumes the generator-as-curriculum creates 'increasingly challenging examples' that force verifier improvement, but the conditions under which this holds in language generation (where quality is multi-dimensional and subjective) are much harder to formalize than in the linear regression setting of Yi et al.\"]\nFeedback: The idea has improved substantially from Round 1 — it now follows the user's specification, provides a concrete theorem statement, and covers extensive related work. The core formal contribution (time-varying verifier convergence) is confirmed as genuinely novel by my independent search. However, several critical issues remain:\n\n1. **Address the Chen et al. asymmetry**: The most serious theoretical challenge. Chen et al. (arXiv 2602.07594) show improving generation does NOT improve verification. Your 'generator-as-curriculum' mechanism assumes the opposite. You must either: (a) argue why co-evolutionary training (where the verifier explicitly retrains on generator outputs) differs from self-verification improvement, or (b) weaken the mutual reinforcement condition to only require that explicit verifier retraining on harder generator outputs improves the verifier (not that generation improvement automatically implies verification improvement). Option (b) is more defensible — the claim should be that *retraining the verifier on the generator's current distribution* (which is closer to real data) improves it, not that 'harder examples' are created.\n\n2. **Cite and differentiate from G-Zero (arXiv 2605.09959)**: This is a May 2026 paper that escapes capability ceilings via verifier-free co-evolution. Your differentiation: CoEvolve provides formal guarantees specifically for the *verified synthetic data* setting, maintaining a calibrated verifier for multi-dimensional quality assessment (fluency, faithfulness, diversity) where binary correctness signals are unavailable. G-Zero's verifier-free approach sacrifices quality verification.\n\n3. **Cite and position against Chojecki (arXiv 2512.02731)**: The GVU framework and Variance Inequality provide abstract stability conditions. Your contribution is more specific: a constructive convergence proof in the synthetic data curation setting with concrete bounds on ceiling escape rate.\n\n4. **Rename from 'CoEvolve'** — the name is taken (arXiv 2604.15840). Suggestions: 'CeilBreak', 'CoVerge' (co-evolution + convergence), or 'DynVer' (dynamic verification).\n\n5. **Fix author attributions**: Feng et al. for ICLR 2025; Yi et al. for ICLR 2026 (not just arXiv).\n\n6. **Be realistic about timeline**: Drop EMNLP 2026 as primary target. Make EACL 2027 (ARR August 2026) the primary target with 2.5 months of runway.\n\n7. **Discuss Data Recipes counterevidence**: Explain why iterative self-training (where error compounds) differs from single-pass SFT (where data volume dominates quality).\n\n8. **Strengthen the formal conditions**: The proof sketch is promising but the mutual reinforcement condition needs more precise formalization. Consider: instead of requiring generator improvement to drive verifier improvement, require only that (a) the verifier retrains on the generator's current distribution (which is measurably closer to real data), and (b) retraining on data closer to the true distribution improves verifier reliability under standard learning-theoretic assumptions (PAC-Bayes or similar). This avoids the Chen et al. objection entirely.\n\n### Round 3 review\nVerdict: error\nIssues: []\nFeedback: Review subprocess failed (timeout or parse error)\n\n### Round 4 review\nVerdict: error\nIssues: []\nFeedback: Review subprocess failed (timeout or parse error)\n\n\n## Output format\nOutput ONLY a JSON object:\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"pass | revise | fail\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"novelty\": {\"score\": 0-5, \"rationale\": \"1-2 sentence justification\"},\n    \"feasibility\": {\"score\": 0-5, \"rationale\": \"1-2 sentence justification\"},\n    \"clarity\": {\"score\": 0-5, \"rationale\": \"1-2 sentence justification\"},\n    \"impact\": {\"score\": 0-5, \"rationale\": \"1-2 sentence justification\"}\n  },\n  \"issues\": [\"specific issue 1\", \"specific issue 2\", ...],\n  \"feedback\": \"Actionable feedback for the generator (if verdict=revise)\",\n  \"reason\": \"One-line summary of verdict rationale\"\n}\n\nRules:\n- \"pass\": idea is sound AND high quality — avg score >= 4.0, no critical issues\n- \"revise\": fixable issues OR scores below threshold — provide specific feedback\n- \"fail\": fundamental flaw (e.g., gap doesn't exist, approach provably wrong, or scores remain low after multiple revisions)\n- Threshold is HIGH (4.0/5.0): agent scores tend to be inflated, so only truly outstanding ideas should pass.

Direction: All existing verified synthetic data methods assume a FIXED verifier, but Yi et al.
(arXiv 2510.16657, Oct 2025) prove this creates an inescapable 'verifier ceiling' — the generator
converges to the verifier's knowledge center, not the true distribution, regardless of iteration
count. Nature 2024 establishes that even 0.1% synthetic contamination triggers model collapse.
Meanwhile, pluralistic preference curation (arXiv 2605.07724, May 2026) preserves diversity but
still assumes fixed reward functions. No method jointly optimizes verifier quality AND data
selection. We propose a co-evolutionary framework where the verifier improves alongside the
generator — the generator's improving outputs serve as an increasingly challenging curriculum
for the verifier, creating a mutual improvement loop that provably escapes the ceiling bound.
CoVerRL (arXiv 2603.17775, March 2026) demonstrates generator-verifier co-evolution in reasoning
RL but without formal convergence guarantees and in a different setting.

Seed Papers:
- "AI Models Collapse When Trained on Recursively Generated Data" (Shumailov et al., Nature 2024)
  — Establishes the problem: indiscriminate use of model-generated content causes irreversible
  defects across LLMs, VAEs, and Gaussian mixtures. Tails of original distributions disappear.
  Even 0.1% synthetic contamination triggers collapse. The seminal empirical motivation.
- "Escaping Model Collapse via Synthetic Data Verification" (Yi et al., arXiv 2510.16657, Oct 2025)
  — Theoretical anchor: proves verified synthetic data prevents collapse near-term BUT converges to
  verifier's 'knowledge center' long-term. Unless verifier is perfectly reliable (r=1), gains
  plateau. Characterizes the ceiling formally: θ_t converges to a point determined by verifier
  reliability r, not the true θ*. The ceiling is tight under fixed r.
- "Beyond Model Collapse: Scaling Up with Synthesized Data Requires Verification" (Fan et al., ICLR 2025, arXiv 2406.07515)
  — Derives breakdown point p* for when verification prevents collapse using Gaussian mixtures and
  linear classifiers. Critical assumption: FIXED verifier quality — does not address verifier
  improvement.
- "Curated Synthetic Data Doesn't Have to Collapse: A Theoretical Study of Generative Retraining
  with Pluralistic Preferences" (arXiv 2605.07724, May 2026)
  — Latest: shows multi-reward curation preserves diversity via weighted Nash bargaining. But
  still assumes FIXED reward functions — does not address the ceiling when all rewards share
  blind spots.
- "CoVerRL: Breaking the Consensus Trap via Generator-Verifier Co-Evolution" (arXiv 2603.17775, March 2026)
  — Demonstrates co-evolution in reasoning RL: generator and verifier improve jointly, breaking
  performance plateaus. Key precedent but (1) no formal convergence guarantees, (2) applied to
  reasoning RL, not general synthetic data curation, (3) does not formally connect to Yi et al.'s
  ceiling bound.

Known Gaps:
- No method jointly optimizes verifier quality AND data selection with formal convergence guarantees.
- Yi et al.'s ceiling is tight for fixed r, but the escape path (making r_t increase with t)
  is uncharacterized.
- CoVerRL shows co-evolution works empirically but has no theory connecting to the verifier
  ceiling bound.
- Pluralistic preferences preserve diversity with fixed rewards but don't address the ceiling
  when all rewards share blind spots.

In-scope: Co-evolutionary frameworks where the verifier's reliability r_t provably increases
alongside generator improvement, with formal convergence guarantees showing the ceiling recedes.
Specifically: using the generator's improving outputs as a curriculum for verifier training
(harder examples as the generator improves), maintaining verifier calibration during co-evolution
(not just discrimination), formal analysis showing r_t → 1 or at least r_t → r* > r_0 under
stated conditions, and empirical validation on language generation tasks (not just toy settings).

NOT in-scope: Proposing yet another fixed-verifier filtering method (the ceiling result makes
this a dead end). GAN-style adversarial training without calibration guarantees (verifier must
remain well-calibrated, not just discriminative). Evaluation only on toy settings (Gaussian
mixtures, MNIST) without language model validation. Methods assuming unlimited fresh human-labeled
data (defeats the purpose of synthetic data).

Contribution type: METHOD + THEORETICAL ANALYSIS. The output must include (1) a co-evolutionary
algorithm with clear verifier update rules, (2) a formal proof or tight bound showing that
co-evolution escapes Yi et al.'s ceiling under stated assumptions, and (3) empirical validation
on at least one language generation task demonstrating ceiling escape.

EVAL PROTOCOL:
TRAIN on: SmolLM2-135M/360M/1.7B as generator models. Verifier initialized from a separate
checkpoint of the same or larger model. Co-evolutionary loop: generate → verify → select →
retrain generator → use generator's harder outputs to retrain verifier → repeat.
EVALUATE on:
- Primary metric: distribution divergence between generator's output distribution and true
  data distribution across co-evolution rounds, compared against fixed-verifier baseline.
  Must demonstrate ceiling escape (continued improvement where fixed-verifier plateaus).
- Verifier reliability r_t trajectory: measure verifier accuracy on held-out evaluation
  set at each co-evolution round — must show monotonic or near-monotonic improvement.
- Text generation quality: perplexity on held-out data, MAUVE score (distribution matching),
  n-gram diversity (Self-BLEU), tail coverage (measuring whether rare phenomena are preserved).
- Summarization task: XSUM or CNN/DailyMail as a concrete language generation benchmark,
  measuring ROUGE, faithfulness (FactScore), and diversity across co-evolution rounds.
- Baseline comparisons:
  1. No verification (pure synthetic recursion — the collapse baseline)
  2. Fixed verifier (Yi et al.'s method — the ceiling baseline)
  3. Periodic verifier retraining on fresh human data (naive co-evolution)
  4. CoVerRL-style co-evolution adapted to generation (no formal guarantees)
  5. Pluralistic fixed-reward curation (May 2026 baseline)
- Ablation: generator curriculum for verifier vs. fixed verifier retraining data,
  calibration maintenance mechanism vs. discrimination-only verifier
- Convergence analysis: empirically measure the ceiling bound and demonstrate it shifts
  upward with co-evolution rounds
- Scale test: compare co-evolution dynamics at 135M vs. 1.7B scale

Building blocks: SmolLM2-135M, SmolLM2-360M, SmolLM2-1.7B (HuggingFace); Yi et al.'s
verification framework (arXiv 2510.16657); CoVerRL codebase (arXiv 2603.17775); XSUM dataset
(EdinburghNLP/xsum); CNN/DailyMail (abisee/cnn_dailymail); MAUVE evaluation library
(krishnap25/mauve-experiments); FactScore for faithfulness evaluation; HuggingFace transformers
+ accelerate for training; DeepSpeed for efficient multi-round training loops; temperature
scaling and Platt scaling libraries for verifier calibration.

HARD CONSTRAINTS:
Compute: ≤200 H100-hours total. Strategy: use small models (SmolLM2-135M/360M) for the
main co-evolutionary experiments — each training round is ~2-5 H100-hours, with 10-20 rounds
needed = ~50-100 H100-hours. Scale validation at 1.7B for 5 rounds (~50 H100-hours).
Baselines and ablations (~50 H100-hours). Total ~150-200 H100-hours.
Eval: Must demonstrate ceiling escape on at least one language generation task (not just toy
settings). Must compare against Yi et al.'s fixed-verifier baseline. Must measure verifier
reliability trajectory. Must include ≥4 baselines.
Must report: distribution divergence curves, verifier reliability r_t trajectory, MAUVE
scores, tail coverage, convergence rate comparison, ablation results.

Look for: (1) Generator-as-curriculum for verifier: as the generator improves, its outputs
become harder to distinguish from real data — use these as a natural difficulty progression
for verifier training. The key insight is that the generator's distribution shift creates
increasingly challenging examples without needing fresh human labels. Formally, if the
generator moves from θ_t to θ_{t+1} closer to θ*, the verifier must improve its decision
boundary to maintain accuracy, forcing r_t to increase. (2) Calibration-preserving co-evolution:
standard adversarial training (GANs) produces discriminative but poorly calibrated verifiers.
For ceiling escape, the verifier must maintain calibration (reliable probability estimates,
not just classification). Use temperature scaling or Platt scaling after each verifier
update round, and prove that calibration maintenance is sufficient for ceiling escape under
the Yi et al. framework. (3) Formal escape bound derivation: extend Yi et al.'s fixed-r
convergence proof to the case where r_t is a function of t. The goal: prove that if
r_t ≥ r_0 + f(t) for some increasing f, then θ_t converges to a neighborhood of θ* whose
radius shrinks with the cumulative verifier improvement ∑f(t). This connects the rate of
verifier improvement to the tightness of ceiling escape. (4) Pluralistic co-evolution: combine
co-evolution with pluralistic preferences (May 2026) — use multiple co-evolving verifiers with
different specializations to avoid the problem of shared blind spots. If each verifier improves
on a different dimension, the joint ceiling is higher than any individual ceiling. (5) Early
stopping and divergence detection: co-evolution can go wrong if the verifier overfits to
the generator's distribution rather than improving general reliability. Design a divergence
monitor that detects when r_t starts decreasing and triggers a corrective step (e.g.,
re-injection of real data into verifier training).

Avoid:
- Assuming access to unlimited fresh human-labeled data — this defeats the purpose of synthetic
  data. The method must work with a FIXED initial seed of human data plus the co-evolutionary loop.
- GAN-style adversarial training without calibration guarantees — verifier must remain
  well-calibrated, not just discriminative. An uncalibrated verifier may report high accuracy
  but still produce a ceiling.
- Toy-only evaluation (Gaussian mixtures, MNIST, linear regression) without language model
  validation — Yi et al. already covered toy settings. The contribution must include ≥1
  language generation task.
- Ignoring the Yi et al. ceiling bound — the theoretical contribution MUST formally connect
  to the ceiling. A method that "just works empirically" without explaining WHY it escapes
  the bound is insufficient.
- Naive periodic retraining as the proposed method — this is the obvious baseline. Must show
  principled co-evolution (generator-as-curriculum, calibration maintenance) substantially
  outperforms naive retraining.
- Conflating verifier improvement with generator improvement — must separately track r_t
  (verifier reliability) and θ_t (generator quality) and show both improve.
- Ignoring CoVerRL — it's the closest existing work and must be explicitly compared against,
  with clear differentiation (formal guarantees + general synthetic data, not just reasoning RL).

IDEA GENERATION QUALITY CONSTRAINTS (hard rules from historical bad cases):

1. No strawman problems: Any claim about "current methods assume X" or "current methods
   fail at Y" MUST cite a specific paper with a specific passage as evidence. Do NOT
   fabricate mainstream assumptions from pre-training knowledge. If you cannot find paper
   evidence, the claim is invalid.

2. No observation-only ideas: "We discover that X happens" is NOT a contribution.
   Discovering a problem is not a contribution — solving it is. Output MUST include a
   complete method, not an analysis/benchmark/empirical study.

3. No mediocre methods: Your method MUST answer:
   - Core Insight: What non-obvious structural property are you exploiting?
     The generator's improving outputs create a natural difficulty curriculum for the verifier —
     this mutual improvement loop can be formally shown to escape the fixed-verifier ceiling.
   - Why Not Obvious: Why isn't this the first thing anyone would try?
     The ceiling was only characterized in Oct 2025 (Yi et al.). Co-evolution in this context
     requires solving the calibration maintenance problem (not present in standard GANs).
     CoVerRL (March 2026) showed it works in reasoning RL but has no formal analysis.
   - Information Exploited: What do you use that a naive baseline doesn't?
     The generator's distribution shift as a signal for verifier curriculum — the generator
     naturally produces harder examples as it improves, without needing external data.
   - Mechanistic Argument: Yi et al. prove ceiling = f(r). If co-evolution makes r_t
     increase monotonically, ceiling recedes. The generator-as-curriculum mechanism ensures
     r_t improvement because the verifier is continuously challenged by harder examples.
     Calibration maintenance ensures r_t improvement is real (not just discrimination).
   If the method can be summarized in one sentence with zero counter-intuitive content → reject.

4. No rehashing existing work: For every core technical component you propose, search with
   at least 3 different queries to confirm no directly related work exists. If you find
   1-2 papers doing similar things, you MUST explicitly state your specific differentiation.

5. No experiment-padding disguise: An idea's value is NOT in how many experiments it can run.
   Self-check with:
   - "Remove experiments test": Delete all results, keep only method description — does it
     teach the reader something non-trivial? Yes — the formal proof that co-evolution escapes
     the ceiling is the contribution.
   - "Baseline fear test": If naive periodic retraining achieves similar results, does this
     paper still have value? Must show principled co-evolution substantially outperforms it.
   - "Citation test": In 5 years, will people cite the numbers or the insight?
     The insight — formal proof that co-evolution breaks the verifier ceiling.
   If any test fails → the idea is garbage, start over.

6. The following method patterns are REJECTED (unless extremely strong structural justification):
   - "Add an X module" — Why this specific structure?
   - "Train on Y data" — Is data construction itself the contribution?
   - "Transfer Z from domain A to B" — What is the structural analogy between A and B?
   - "Combine P and Q" — Where is the synergy? Why isn't it just 1+1=2?
   - "Use more/bigger/stronger X" — Scaling is not a method contribution.

COMPETITION WARNING: CoVerRL (March 2026) is the closest competitor — demonstrates
generator-verifier co-evolution in reasoning RL. Differentiation: we provide formal
convergence guarantees (CoVerRL has none) and address general synthetic data curation
(not just reasoning RL). EvoSyn (arXiv 2510.17928) uses evolutionary data synthesis but
with fixed fitness functions. Generative Adversarial Reasoner (ICLR 2026) uses adversarial
generator-verifier loops for reasoning. Self-Verification (NeurIPS 2025) proves self-verification
prevents collapse but assumes a fixed self-verifier. The pluralistic preferences paper
(May 2026) is complementary — their multi-reward approach could be combined with co-evolution.
No existing paper provides formal ceiling escape guarantees with co-evolution — this gap
is confirmed open as of May 2026. Monitor: Yi et al.'s group for a co-evolution follow-up,
CoVerRL authors for a theory paper, and the pluralistic preferences group.

### 上下文管理

你的输出 token 有限，必须在上下文耗尽之前完成 JSON 输出。

- 上述搜索次数是理想目标。在上下文充裕时应尽量多搜、深搜，搜得越充分越好。
- 但必须动态评估剩余上下文：如果已经消耗了大量上下文，应优先完成输出，不要为了凑次数而冒着无法输出的风险。
- WebFetch 深度阅读很有价值，但每次 fetch 消耗大量 token——优先 fetch 最关键的 2-3 篇，而不是每篇都 fetch。
- 质量 > 数量：5 次精准搜索 + 深度思考 > 15 次浅层搜索。


As a reviewer, your search focus should be:
1. **验证 claim**：Generator 声称的 SOTA、gap、novelty 是否属实
2. **找竞争论文**：是否有 Generator 遗漏的高度相关/相似的工作
3. **找反面证据**：是否有论文表明 Generator 的 approach 行不通
4. **引用链检查**：通过核心论文的 cited-by 发现 concurrent work

## 竞争论文专项搜索（Reviewer 独有）

这是你作为 Reviewer 最重要的职责之一——发现 Generator 遗漏的竞争工作：

1. **关键词变体搜索**：用至少 3 种不同的关键词组合搜索同一个问题
   - 同义词替换（e.g., 'efficient' → 'lightweight/fast/scalable'）
   - 不同粒度（e.g., 'text classification' → 'sentiment analysis' → 'NLP'）
   - 方法名 + 任务名的不同组合

2. **知名团队追踪**：如果你知道哪些团队/实验室在做相关方向，
   搜索他们最近的论文（`"team_name" OR "author_name" {topic} {year}`）

3. **会议最新录用**：搜索最近一轮 ICML/NeurIPS/ICLR/AAAI/ACL 等会议的 accepted papers
   - `site:openreview.net {topic} 2026`
   - `{conference_name} 2026 accepted papers {topic}`

4. **arXiv 近 3 个月密集搜索**：对精确相关的关键词，搜索过去 3 个月的 arXiv 论文
   这是发现 concurrent work 最有效的窗口

如果你发现了 Generator 遗漏的重要相关工作，必须在 issues 中列出论文标题和链接，
并在 feedback 中说明这些工作如何影响 idea 的 novelty。

## Review checklist
1. **SOTA freshness**: Are the models/baselines cited actually current SOTA?
   If outdated, specify what the current SOTA is and cite your source.
2. **Reference verification**: Do the cited papers actually exist? (WebSearch to check)
3. **Gap validity**: Does the claimed research gap still exist, or has recent work addressed it?
4. **Venue validity**: Are target_venues' submission deadlines after 2026-05-18?
5. **Feasibility**: Is the resource estimate realistic? Are there hidden dependencies?
6. **Novelty**: Is this sufficiently different from existing work?
   When scoring novelty < 4:
   - You MUST identify the closest existing work(s) via WebSearch
   - In your feedback, write: "This idea is too similar to [Paper Title (Venue Year)]. Specifically, [what overlaps]. To differentiate, the generator should [suggestion]."
   - This gives the generator targeted guidance to boost novelty, not just "be more novel".
7. **Cost realism across modes**: Are the three mode estimates (manual/human-in-loop/auto) internally consistent?
   - Auto Research uses more GPU hours (2-5x manual) but GPU idle rate should be near zero
   - Auto Research timeline should reflect resource availability as bottleneck — days with sufficient GPUs, not weeks
   - Human-in-Loop should fall between manual and auto on most dimensions
   - Manual and HIL must NOT include salary/wages — only GPU and API costs
   - Auto Research must NOT include agent operational overhead
   - If any mode estimate is clearly unrealistic, flag it

## Previous review history
### Round 1 review
Verdict: revise
Issues: ["CRITICAL MISMATCH WITH USER REQUIREMENTS: User specified SmolLM2-135M/360M/1.7B as generators, evaluation on language generation tasks (XSUM, CNN/DailyMail), metrics including MAUVE/perplexity/Self-BLEU/ROUGE/FactScore, and target venue EMNLP 2026. The idea instead uses Qwen3-8B on math reasoning (MATH, GSM8K, AIME) with ECE/MCE metrics and targets ICLR 2027. This is a wholesale departure from the user's specification.", "MISSED CRITICAL COMPETING WORK — DCPO (arXiv 2603.09117, March 2026): DCPO already decouples calibration from accuracy in GRPO-based RL training, reducing ECE by 71.6% on Qwen3-8B. CalCoEvo's mechanism (1) — proper-scoring-rule-based calibration reward — directly overlaps with DCPO's approach. This paper is not cited or discussed.", "MISSED CRITICAL COMPETING WORK — RLCR/Beyond Binary Rewards (arXiv 2507.16806): Uses Brier score as calibration reward during RL training of reasoning models — essentially the same idea as CalCoEvo's mechanism (1). Published 2025, not cited.", "MISSED RELATED WORK — Convergence Dynamics of Co-Evolving Generative Models (arXiv 2503.08117, March 2025): Provides formal convergence analysis of co-evolving generative models including collapse dynamics and stabilization, directly relevant to the theoretical contribution claimed.", "MISSED RELATED WORK — Solver-Verifier Gap (arXiv 2507.00075, ICLR 2026): Theoretically models self-improvement training dynamics through the solver-verifier gap with convergence analysis — highly relevant to the verifier ceiling escape theory.", "NO FORMAL THEOREM OR PROOF SKETCH: User required 'a formal proof or tight bound showing that co-evolution escapes Yi et al.'s ceiling under stated assumptions.' The idea describes three engineering mechanisms but never articulates what the formal result would state. 'Calibration maintenance ensures r_t improvement is real' is a necessary condition, not a convergence proof.", "PROBLEM DRIFT: User's direction was about co-evolutionary synthetic data curation for language generation with formal ceiling escape guarantees. The idea pivoted to calibration engineering in math reasoning RL — a related but much narrower and already-addressed problem.", "VENUE INFEASIBILITY: EMNLP 2026 ARR deadline is May 25, 2026 (7 days away). The idea requires 1500-5000 A100-hours of training. Even the idea itself recommends ICLR 2027 as the 'best fit,' effectively conceding infeasibility for the user's target venue.", "FALLS INTO REJECTED PATTERN: 'Combine P and Q' — combines calibration techniques (from Rewarding Doubt/DCPO) with co-evolution (from RL Tango/CoVerRL). Where is the synergy? The idea doesn't demonstrate why combining these produces more than the sum of parts."]
Feedback: This idea drifted fundamentally from the user's requirements. To revise productively:

1. **Return to the user's specification**: Use SmolLM2-135M/360M/1.7B as generators, evaluate on language generation tasks (XSUM/CNN-DailyMail), report MAUVE/perplexity/Self-BLEU/ROUGE/FactScore. The core problem — escaping the verifier ceiling in synthetic data curation — is distinct from calibration in math reasoning RL and has much less competition.

2. **Differentiate from DCPO and RLCR**: These papers already solve 'calibration during RL training.' Your unique angle must be the *co-evolutionary synthetic data curation* setting per the user's direction — using the generator's improving outputs as curriculum for verifier training, with the verifier's improving quality enabling better data selection. This is fundamentally different from calibrating a single model's confidence.

3. **Provide the formal result**: The user's key differentiator is formal ceiling escape guarantees. Extend Yi et al.'s fixed-r convergence proof to r_t = r_0 + f(t). State the theorem: 'If r_t ≥ r_0 + f(t) for increasing f, then θ_t converges to B(θ*, g(∑f(t))) where g is decreasing.' Then prove the generator-as-curriculum mechanism ensures r_t increases monotonically under stated conditions. This formal contribution is what separates the idea from CoVerRL (empirical only) and makes it publishable.

4. **Address the timeline**: If EMNLP 2026 is truly the target, scope the experiments to what's achievable in ~200 H100-hours with SmolLM2-135M (fast training) over 7 days. Alternatively, explicitly propose a next-cycle ARR submission.

5. **Cite and differentiate from**: DCPO (arXiv 2603.09117), RLCR (arXiv 2507.16806), Convergence Dynamics of Co-Evolving Models (arXiv 2503.08117), and Solver-Verifier Gap (arXiv 2507.00075, ICLR 2026). Your differentiation: these address calibration in single-model RL or abstract co-evolution, not calibrated co-evolutionary synthetic data curation with ceiling escape guarantees.

### Round 2 review
Verdict: revise
Issues: ["MISSED CRITICAL COMPETING WORK — G-Zero (arXiv 2605.09959, May 2026): Proposes verifier-free co-evolutionary self-play that explicitly targets escaping capability ceilings in open-ended generation. Has best-iterate suboptimality guarantees. While it takes a different approach (eliminating verifiers rather than co-evolving them), it addresses the same problem and must be discussed as an alternative paradigm. Its existence weakens the claim that co-evolving the verifier is the only path to ceiling escape.", "MISSED CRITICAL RELATED WORK — Chen et al. 'Learning to Self-Verify' (arXiv 2602.07594, Feb 2026): Demonstrates a fundamental asymmetry: improving generation does NOT lead to improved self-verification, but improving verification DOES improve generation. This directly challenges the 'generator-as-curriculum' mechanism which assumes improving generator outputs create harder verification tasks that force verifier improvement. If this asymmetry holds in the co-evolution setting, the mutual reinforcement condition may not be satisfiable.", "MISSED RELATED WORK — Chojecki 'Self-Improving AI Agents through Self-Play' (arXiv 2512.02731, Dec 2025): Formalizes generator-verifier-updater (GVU) dynamics and derives a 'Variance Inequality' — a spectral stability condition for self-improving systems. The proposed formal contribution must relate to or improve upon this existing framework.", "NAME COLLISION: 'CoEvolve' is already used by arXiv 2604.15840 (April 2026) — 'CoEvolve: Training LLM Agents via Agent-Data Mutual Evolution.' Must rename to avoid confusion in the literature.", "AUTHOR ATTRIBUTION ERROR: First key reference cites 'Beyond Model Collapse' (ICLR 2025) as 'Yi et al.' but actual authors are Feng, Dohmatob, Yang, Charton, and Kempe. Yi et al. authored the separate paper arXiv 2510.16657.", "VENUE STATUS ERROR: Yi et al. (arXiv 2510.16657) is listed as an arXiv preprint but was actually accepted at ICLR 2026 — this is a stronger citation than presented.", "GENERATOR-AS-CURRICULUM MECHANISM CHALLENGED: The formal argument relies on a 'mutual reinforcement condition' where improving generator outputs force the verifier to improve. Chen et al. (2602.07594) empirically demonstrate the opposite direction: generation improvement does not drive verification improvement. The paper must either (1) provide formal conditions under which the asymmetry is resolved in the co-evolution setting, or (2) modify the mechanism to account for one-directional coupling.", "EMNLP 2026 PRIMARY TARGET INFEASIBLE: The deadline (May 25, 2026) is 7 days away. A formal convergence proof plus SmolLM2 experiments at three scales on two datasets with five baselines cannot be completed in this timeframe. The idea acknowledges EACL 2027 and ICLR 2027 as fallbacks, but the primary target should be realistic.", "POTENTIAL COUNTEREVIDENCE: 'Data Recipes for Reasoning Models' (ICLR 2026) shows that verification filtering does not improve over no filtering in single-pass SFT regimes. While this applies to a different setting (single-pass vs. iterative), the idea should discuss why iterative co-evolutionary verification is valuable when single-pass verification may not be.", "PROOF RISK: The formal theorem requires proving Δ_t ≤ Δ_0·q^t (geometric contraction of verifier bias). The sketch assumes the generator-as-curriculum creates 'increasingly challenging examples' that force verifier improvement, but the conditions under which this holds in language generation (where quality is multi-dimensional and subjective) are much harder to formalize than in the linear regression setting of Yi et al."]
Feedback: The idea has improved substantially from Round 1 — it now follows the user's specification, provides a concrete theorem statement, and covers extensive related work. The core formal contribution (time-varying verifier convergence) is confirmed as genuinely novel by my independent search. However, several critical issues remain:

1. **Address the Chen et al. asymmetry**: The most serious theoretical challenge. Chen et al. (arXiv 2602.07594) show improving generation does NOT improve verification. Your 'generator-as-curriculum' mechanism assumes the opposite. You must either: (a) argue why co-evolutionary training (where the verifier explicitly retrains on generator outputs) differs from self-verification improvement, or (b) weaken the mutual reinforcement condition to only require that explicit verifier retraining on harder generator outputs improves the verifier (not that generation improvement automatically implies verification improvement). Option (b) is more defensible — the claim should be that *retraining the verifier on the generator's current distribution* (which is closer to real data) improves it, not that 'harder examples' are created.

2. **Cite and differentiate from G-Zero (arXiv 2605.09959)**: This is a May 2026 paper that escapes capability ceilings via verifier-free co-evolution. Your differentiation: CoEvolve provides formal guarantees specifically for the *verified synthetic data* setting, maintaining a calibrated verifier for multi-dimensional quality assessment (fluency, faithfulness, diversity) where binary correctness signals are unavailable. G-Zero's verifier-free approach sacrifices quality verification.

3. **Cite and position against Chojecki (arXiv 2512.02731)**: The GVU framework and Variance Inequality provide abstract stability conditions. Your contribution is more specific: a constructive convergence proof in the synthetic data curation setting with concrete bounds on ceiling escape rate.

4. **Rename from 'CoEvolve'** — the name is taken (arXiv 2604.15840). Suggestions: 'CeilBreak', 'CoVerge' (co-evolution + convergence), or 'DynVer' (dynamic verification).

5. **Fix author attributions**: Feng et al. for ICLR 2025; Yi et al. for ICLR 2026 (not just arXiv).

6. **Be realistic about timeline**: Drop EMNLP 2026 as primary target. Make EACL 2027 (ARR August 2026) the primary target with 2.5 months of runway.

7. **Discuss Data Recipes counterevidence**: Explain why iterative self-training (where error compounds) differs from single-pass SFT (where data volume dominates quality).

8. **Strengthen the formal conditions**: The proof sketch is promising but the mutual reinforcement condition needs more precise formalization. Consider: instead of requiring generator improvement to drive verifier improvement, require only that (a) the verifier retrains on the generator's current distribution (which is measurably closer to real data), and (b) retraining on data closer to the true distribution improves verifier reliability under standard learning-theoretic assumptions (PAC-Bayes or similar). This avoids the Chen et al. objection entirely.
